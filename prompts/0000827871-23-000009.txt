Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Organization
We are a pharmaceutical company registered at and with principal offices at 50 Tice Boulevard, Suite 315, Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey 07677. We also have a research and development facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, office space in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and Indianapolis, Indiana.
Business
We are a fully integrated pharmaceutical company with research and development, clinical, manufacturing and commercial expertise. We are committed to developing innovative medicines that result in meaningful improvements in patients’ lives. 
Our science-based business model has a proven track record with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval and commercial launches of six products: PEMFEXY® (pemetrexed for injection), vasopressin, an A-rated generic alternative to Vasostrict®, Ryanodex® (dantrolene sodium) ("Ryanodex"), bendamustine RTD 500ml solution ("Belrapzo"), rapidly infused bendamustine RTD ("Bendeka") and bendamustine ready-to-dilute and rapidly infused RTD in Japan (“Treakisym”). We market our products through marketing partners and/or our internal direct sales force. We market PEMFEXY, vasopressin, Ryanodex and Belrapzo, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ("Teva") markets Bendeka through its subsidiary Cephalon, Inc. SymBio Pharmaceuticals Limited ("SymBio"), markets Treakisym, a RTD product, in Japan.
We acquired Acacia Pharma as of June 9, 2022, which added two FDA approved new chemical entities with patent protection, BARHEMSYS® (amisulpride for injection) and BYFAVO® (remimazolam for injection). The addition of these two products expands our presence in the acute care space.
With several pipeline projects underway and the potential for product launches over the next few years, we believe we have many growth opportunities ahead. We believe that each of our pipeline projects currently has the potential to enter the market as a first-in-class, first-to-file or best-in-class product. In particular, we are applying our expertise to conduct novel research regarding the potential for Ryanodex to address conditions including nerve agent, acute radiation syndrome, traumatic brain injury/concussion and Alzheimer’s disease as well as investigations of compounds such as EA-114 (our fulvestrant product candidate) for patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer. Our clinical development program also includes a license agreement with Combioxin, SA under which we were granted exclusive, worldwide development commercialization rights to CAL02, a novel first-in-class anti-infective agent for Phase 2b/3 development for the treatment of severe pneumonia in combination with traditional antibacterial drugs and a license agreement with AOP Health Group (“AOP Orphan”), for the commercial rights to its product, landiolol in the United States. Landiolol is a leading hospital emergency use product, which is currently approved in Europe for the treatment of non-compensatory sinus tachycardia and tachycardic supraventricular arrhythmias. Landiolol is not currently approved in the United States. We supported the submission of a NDA in the second quarter of 2022 by AOP Orphan to the FDA seeking approval for landiolol for the short term reduction of ventricular rate in patients with SVT, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
Recent Developments
Discontinuance of Vasopressin 
During the first quarter of 2023, we gave notice to customers and the FDA that it was withdrawing from the vasopressin market. Inventory on hand and in the distribution channel is expected to be depleted by the end of the second quarter of 2023.
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On November 1, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Third Amended Credit Agreement”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) and the lenders party thereto, which replaced our prior credit agreement, dated as of November 8, 2019 (the “the Second Amended Credit Agreement”). The terms and amounts borrowed under the Third Amended Credit Agreement include a drawn term loan of $50 million and a $100 million revolving credit facility of which $15.0 million was drawn on November 1, 2022. In addition, approximately $35.4 million of the proceeds of the credit facility were used to refinance all amounts outstanding under the 
Second Amended Credit Agreement, and we used the remaining proceeds to repay certain indebtedness of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Acacia Pharma, and for other corporate purposes. All amounts outstanding under the Third Amended Credit Agreement shall be due and payable on October 31, 2025, unless otherwise accelerated or extended pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended Credit Agreement.
Enalare Investment
On August 8, 2022, we and Enalare Therapeutics Inc. (“Enalare”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we have committed to provide equity investments of up to $55 million in Enalare, subject to the completion of certain development milestones (the “Purchase Agreement”). Concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we, Enalare and holders of all of the outstanding capital stock, and any securities or options exercisable for capital stock, of Enalare (the “Securityholders”) entered into a Security Purchase Option Agreement, pursuant to which we were granted an option (the “Purchase Option”) to acquire all of the remaining outstanding shares of Enalare other than those that we already own, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement (the “Option Agreement”). The term of the Purchase Option (the “Option Period”) commenced on August 8, 2022 and will end upon the earlier of (x) 90 days following FDA authorization to begin a Phase 3 clinical study for a Product Candidate or (y) June 30, 2027. Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement, Enalare shall not initiate Phase 3 pivotal studies prior to the end of the Option Period and we shall have reasonable access to all relevant data and documents following the Phase 3 Milestone (as defined in the Option Agreement). 
ENA-001 is an investigational, new chemical entity being developed by Enalare as an agnostic respiratory stimulant for multiple patient populations experiencing acute respiratory depression. The initial targeted indications include post-operative respiratory depression; community drug overdose; and Apnea of Prematurity, a common condition in preterm infants. FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ENA-001 for the treatment of Apnea of Prematurity (“AoP”). AoP is a development disorder attributed to immaturity of the pulmonary system characterized by either cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds or cessation of breathing that lasts less than 20 seconds but is accompanied by either bradycardia or hypoxemia.
Acacia Acquisition
On June 9, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Acacia Pharma Group plc ("Acacia"), formerly a public company organized under the laws of England and Wales, through an offer of approximately $76 million in cash and 516,024 shares of our common stock for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Acacia by means of a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006. The acquisition added two FDA approved currently marketed, acute care, hospital products, both of which are new chemical entities with strong patent protection:
•BARHEMSYS (amisulpride for injection), the first and only antiemetic approved by the FDA for rescue treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting, after failed prophylaxis, and 
•BYFAVO (remimazolam for injection), indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.
Landiolol
On June 1, 2022, we announced that AOP Orphan, with whom we entered into a licensing agreement in August 2021, submitted an NDA to the FDA for landiolol, a short-acting, intravenous (“IV”), cardio-selective beta-1 adrenergic blocker product candidate. The submission seeks approval for landiolol for the short-term reduction of ventricular rate in patients with supraventricular tachycardia (“SVT”), including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The FDA’s decision with respect to approval is expected in mid-2023. Patient enrollment for a study of pediatric patients with supraventricular tachycardia is underway in Europe. 
PEMFEXY
In December 2022, the FDA approved an additional indication for PEMFEXY (pemetrexed injection) in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy for the initial treatment of patients with metastatic, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. In December 2022, we also amended our agreement with Robert One to amend the applicable royalty rates due by us on Gross Profits derived from the Robert One 2009 Subject Products to (i) thirty percent with respect to a 505(b)(2) application; (ii) thirty percent with respect to an ANDA application; and (iii) with respect to pemetrexed parenteral formulation, (a) ten percent on Gross Profits greater than $85,000,000 and (b) twelve percent on Gross Profits greater than $115,000,000. In addition, under the terms of the amendment, no royalty payment is due on Gross Profits derived from pemetrexed parenteral formulation that are less than $85,000,000. In exchange for the foregoing amended royalty rates, we made a one-time lump sum payment of $15,000,000 to Robert One on January 3, 2023. See “Business—License Agreements—Development and License Agreement with Robert One, LLC (pemetrexed).”
On February 1, 2022, we announced the commercial availability of our novel product PEMFEXY® (pemetrexed for injection). A branded alternative to ALIMTA®, Eagle's PEMFEXY is a ready-to-use liquid with a unique J-code approved to treat nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma.
CAL02
We submitted an IND to the FDA for CAL02, a novel first-in-class anti-infective agent for the treatment of severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (“SCABP”). The IND filing includes a protocol for a global Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAL02 when added to standard of care therapy in patients with SCABP.
We expect to start a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial for CAL02 patients later in 2023, during pneumonia season. In August 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Combioxin SA under which we were granted exclusive, worldwide development and commercialization rights to CAL02, a novel approach to the treatment of severe bacterial pneumonia. 
Bendeka Settlement
On December 9, 2022, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement, or the Accord Settlement Agreement, with Accord Healthcare Inc., or Accord, relating to our product BENDEKA® (rapidly infused bendamustine hydrochloride). This settlement resolves patent litigation brought by us and our marketing partners Teva Pharmaceuticals International, GmbH and Cephalon, Inc. relating to the alleged infringement of Orange Book listed United States Patent Nos. 8,609,707; 9,265,831; 9,572,796; 9,572,797; 9,034,908; 9,144,568; 9,572,887; 9,597,397; 9,597,398; 9,597,399; 9,000,021; 9,579,384; 10,052,385; 10,010,533; and 11,103,483, or the Asserted Patents, with respect to Accord’s 505(b)(2) NDA, No. 215749. Pursuant to the terms of the Accord Settlement Agreement, we will grant Accord a license to market Accord’s product made under NDA No. 215749 in the United States beginning on January 17, 2028 (subject to FDA approval), or earlier under certain circumstances. Additionally, in accordance with the Agreement, the parties will terminate all ongoing litigation among us, Teva Pharmaceuticals International, GmbH and Cephalon, Inc. and Accord regarding BENDEKA® and the Asserted Patents pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The Agreement is confidential and subject to review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. 
On April 19, 2022, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement, or the Hospira Settlement Agreement, with Hospira, Inc., or Hospira, relating to our product BENDEKA® (rapidly infused bendamustine hydrochloride). This settlement resolves patent litigation brought by us and our marketing partners Teva Pharmaceuticals International, GmbH and Cephalon, Inc. relating to the alleged infringement of Orange Book listed United States Patent Nos. 11,103,483 and 9,572,887, or the Asserted Patents, with respect to Hospira’s 505(b)(2) NDA, No. 211530. Pursuant to the terms of the Hospira Settlement Agreement, we will grant Hospira a license to market Hospira’s product made under NDA No. 211530 in the United States beginning on January 17, 2028 (subject to FDA approval), or earlier under certain circumstances. Additionally, in accordance with the Agreement, the parties will terminate all ongoing litigation among us, Teva Pharmaceuticals International, GmbH and Cephalon, Inc. and Hospira regarding the Asserted Patents pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The Agreement is confidential and subject to review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.
TREAKISYM
Our bendamustine franchise continues to grow, including the launch of the TREAKISYM rapid infusion, or RI (50ml) liquid formulation by SymBio in Japan in the first quarter of 2022, and the RTD formulation in the first quarter of 2021.
Share Repurchase Program
On August 9, 2016, we announced a share repurchase program approved by our board of directors authorizing the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our common stock (the “2016 Repurchase Program”). On August 9, 2017, we announced a new share repurchase program approved by the board, which authorized the repurchase up to an additional $100 million of our outstanding common stock (the “2017 Repurchase Program”). Under the 2016 Repurchase Program and the 2017 Share Repurchase Program, we were authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. On October 30, 2018, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $150 million of our outstanding common stock, consisting of (i) up to $50 million in repurchases pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and (ii) up to $100 million in additional repurchases (the “2018 Repurchase Program”). In connection with its approval of the 2018 Repurchase Program, our board of directors terminated the 2016 Repurchase Program and 2017 Repurchase Program. In March 2020, our board of directors approved our current share repurchase program (the “2020 Repurchase Program” and, together with the 2016 Repurchase Program, 2017 Repurchase Program and 2018 Repurchase Program, the “Share Repurchase Program”) providing for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $160.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The 2020 Repurchase Program replaced our 2018 Repurchase Program, which was terminated in connection with the 2020 Repurchase 
Program. At termination, we had repurchased approximately $68.0 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, we have repurchased an aggregate of 4,552,730 shares of common stock for an aggregate of $246.1 million pursuant to our share repurchase programs in effect since August 2016.
COVID-19 and Macroeconomic Environment Business Update
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken and continue to take active measures designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, such as remote working policies, facilitating management’s daily communication to address employee and business concerns and providing frequent updates to the Board. While we have experienced variable financial and operational impacts to date, the COVID-19 pandemic, including the global economic slowdown, government measures taken in response thereto, the overall disruption of global healthcare systems and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We continue to monitor COVID-19 as we evaluate and evolve our business plans and response strategy. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial condition is more fully described below in Trends and Uncertainties.
In addition, we continue to monitor the impacts of other global and worsening macroeconomic conditions, such as global geopolitical tension, increasing inflation and interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions and increases in commodity, energy and fuel prices.
The U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies' ability to do business in Russia as a result of the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to further expand our business and to otherwise generate revenues and develop our product candidates. In addition, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
Our Competitive Strengths
Our Purpose
We believe that many currently available critical care and oncology injectable drugs and biopharmaceuticals have suboptimal characteristics that do not meet the needs of patients, physicians, nurses or pharmacists. These characteristics can impact safety, shelf life, convenience, waste, cost, and ease of use by practitioners and pharmacy staff. For instance, existing drugs may be packaged inefficiently or come in formulations that require reconstitution or dilution, or which are otherwise difficult or inconvenient to prepare, and which could expose workers to cytotoxic compounds and can result in dosing errors. This can also lead to wasted quantities of drug, inefficiencies in staff time and constrained work flow, reduced shelf life and the need for multiple dosing of individual patients to complete treatment. Likewise the viscosity of many biologic products requires them to be delivered intravenously often in time consuming and sometimes painful treatments for patients. We believe there is a large and unmet market for developing injectable drugs that address the specific needs of patients, physicians, nurses and pharmacists to simplify their use, reduce waste and lower healthcare costs. 
We have and continue to engage physicians, nurses, pharmacists and key opinion leaders, to identify specific products where the characteristics described above present opportunities for product improvement. We evaluate the product opportunities presented by the stakeholders and determine whether or not they conform to our research and development planning. A key aspect of our evaluation is the intellectual property landscape for each product opportunity, including our ability to avoid infringing existing patents and the potential patentability of our modified version of the drug. We utilize our experienced team of formulators with extensive experience with injectable pharmaceuticals, and a track record of success in product development, regulatory relations, and quality assurance to develop improved products.
Because our products are differentiated from the branded reference drugs, we believe we are able to avoid infringing existing patents covering the branded reference drug allowing us to enter the existing market before applicable generic drugs, which may be subject to protracted patent litigation that delays market entry. Protracted litigation is a significant barrier to entry for competitors seeking approval of an ANDA referencing the branded reference product, and our early entry into the market leads to less price erosion due to constrained competition. Our patent holdings include over 30 owned or exclusively-licensed U.S. issued patents and over 30 filed U.S. patent applications, as well as several patents and patent applications that have been filed 
in various worldwide territories, that we believe protect or will protect, as applicable the market value of our current portfolio of products. We believe that other potential barriers to entry for our competitors consist of the following:
•our early entry into the market allows us to influence usage patterns when fewer, if any, competitors exist and allows us to market our products as improved versions of the branded reference drug prior to or concurrent with any generic entry, thereby giving us the opportunity to capture significant market share at this early stage. We believe that such early entry into the market will limit later conversions into generic versions of the branded reference drugs, allowing us to maintain market share and favorable pricing;
•the potential for seven years of exclusivity upon approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA that receives orphan drug status; and
•the potential for three years of regulatory exclusivity for our future product candidates upon approval, if any, of a 505(b)(2) NDA supported by new clinical investigations (other than bioequivalence and bioavailability studies) essential to approval of the application.
Our product portfolio is focused around our external partnerships (e.g., Teva, and SymBio); our PEMFEXY product, our newly acquired products BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO from Acacia acquisition; our Ryanodex related development program; and our Fulvestrant development program that is expected to yield a new approach to drug delivery if successful.
We believe that we can leverage our formulation and development expertise to achieve improved product attributes in terms of potential for longer stability, shorter infusion times, less waste and/or ease and safety of use for healthcare professionals and achieve longer commercial duration compared to generic competitors. We believe that our products may offer certain benefits as compared to existing injectable drugs which may include one or more of the following:
•improved safety through elimination of reconstitution in the pharmacy or in the acute care setting;
•reduction in the number of injections required;
•reduction in the volume of drug needed to be injected, potentially expanding the application to additional medical situations;
•reduction in the amount of diluent required to administer the drug;
•reduction in drug waste;
•reduction in drug infusion time; and
•potential label expansion to include additional indications.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company. Our strategy to achieve this goal includes:
Strengthen our product portfolio. We intend to continue to strengthen our product portfolio with continued investment in research and development activities and other business development opportunities. We will continue to develop our current product portfolio and leverage our expertise to identify new products with suboptimal characteristics that present us with significant opportunity for revenue generation. In addition to our internal efforts, we plan to opportunistically in-license or acquire product candidates that meet our rigorous evaluation process, fit our therapeutic areas of focus and match our commercial, regulatory and development expertise. Any in-licensing or product acquisitions are excepted to be funded through cash and cash equivalents, in combination with issuances of our common stock, borrowings under our Third Amended Credit Agreement or other debt arrangements, or other means. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
Retain commercial rights in the United States and selectively partner outside of the United States. In general, we believe that we can cost-effectively commercialize our products in the United States internally or through a contracted sales force and selected commercial arrangements, and thereby retain the commercial value of these products. We have established a small, contract specialty sales force focusing on  group purchasing organizations, ("GPOs"), hospital systems and key stakeholders in acute care settings, primarily hospitals. Outside of the United States, we may utilize partners for the commercialization of our products.
Continue to build a robust intellectual property portfolio. Our patent estate includes over 70 owned or exclusively-licensed U.S. issued patents and over 30 filed U.S. patent applications, as well as several that have been filed in various worldwide territories, that protect or will protect, as applicable the market value of our approved and pipeline products. We intend to continue to build our patent portfolio by filing for patent protection on new developments with respect to our product candidates that will not infringe patents that cover the branded reference drugs. We expect that these will, if issued, allow us to list our own patents in the Orange Book, to which potential competitors will be required to certify upon submission of their applications referencing 
our products, if approved.
Our Products and Product Portfolio
BARHEMSYS® and BYFAVO®
Overview
On June 9, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of Acacia, which added two FDA approved new chemical entities with patent protection to our product portfolio, BARHEMSYS® (amisulpride for injection) and BYFAVO® (remimazolam for injection). The addition of these two products expands our presence in the acute care space, and we believe that our hospital-based salesforce will have success commercializing these assets.
BARHEMSYS (amisulpride for injection), is the first and only antiemetic approved by the FDA for rescue treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting, after failed prophylaxis. BYFAVO (remimazolam for injection), is indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less. 
Competitive U.S. Marketed Products; 
Fresenius Kabi supplies Propofol globally and Pfizer currently markets Midazolam. See “Business—Competition” and “Risk Factors — We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.”
Limitations of Competitive U.S. Marketed Products, 
Propofol is fast acting but significant safety issues include the need of an anesthesiologist to continuously monitor with no reversal agent.
Midazolam has a better safety profile than Propofol but has slower onset for sedation and offset for recovery. 
Eagle's Solution:
BARHEMSYS is the first and only FDA-approved product for Post Operative Nausea and Vomiting (“PONV”) rescue after failed prophylaxis. It is a selective dopamine D2 /D3 antagonist with a broad, differentiated label. PONV is a common complication of surgery, occurring in approximately 30% of all surgical patients and 80% of high-risk patients. PONV is associated with the use of anesthetic gases and opioid painkillers and is particularly common following gynecological, abdominal, breast, eye, and ear operations, especially those lasting an hour or more. PONV can delay hospital discharge; result in re-admission after in-patient procedures; and lead to day-case patients being admitted to the hospital, all of which can result in significantly increased healthcare costs. By reducing these risks, we believe BARHEMSYS offers the potential for significant economic savings to hospitals and ambulatory centers. BARHEMSYS is the only drug with an FDA-approved indication to treat patients who have failed PONV prophylaxis. It has an established safety profile and efficacy demonstrated in multiple well-controlled clinical studies. BARHEMSYS is nonsedating, a common complaint of standard antiemetic agents. Patients experiencing PONV who were treated in a pivotal clinical trial and failed prophylaxis were treated with BARHEMSYS. These patients were observed to have shorter post-anesthesia care (“PACU”) and hospital stays than patients who were not. 
BYFAVO is a rapid onset/offset procedural sedative with an established safety and efficacy profile. Additional benefits include predictability and a readily available reversal agent. BYFAVO has a compelling commercial opportunity, addressing a clear unmet need. There has been no innovation in the sedation space for over 20 years. Customers seek a fast onset, titratability, and rapid recovery for quick discharge, and we believe shorter procedure times should support increased procedural volumes. BYFAVO has a broad label and we believe has potential health economic benefits and may enable shorter procedure times and greater patient throughput. It is indicated for procedural sedation in adults in procedures lasting 30 minutes or less and has a substantial clinical data package demonstrating efficacy and safety in colonoscopies and bronchoscopies, including the most challenging patients.
BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO are sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers through a third-party logistics partner.
Commercial factors impacting our revenues derived from BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO are:
•the effectiveness of our sales force;
•the level of orders submitted by wholesalers, hospitals and surgery centers;
•the level of institutional demand for our products; 
•unit sales prices, net of any sales reserves;
•the diversion of management attention to integration matters;
•difficulties in achieving anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition;
•difficulties in assimilating employees; and
•potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences, unforeseen increased expenses or other unanticipated problems associated with the transaction.
Belrapzo, Bendeka (Licensed to Teva) and Treakisym (Licensed to SymBio) for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Overview
Bendamustine is an alkylating agent approved for use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and indolent B-cell non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (which we refer to herein as the NHL indication). 
Competitive U.S. Marketed Bendamustine Products
Teva currently markets its lyophilized bendamustine product under the trade name Treanda®. Teva ceased distribution of Treanda® liquid on March 30, 2016. See “Business—Competition” and “Risk Factors—We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.”
Limitations of Competitive U.S. Marketed Bendamustine Products
Treanda® is a lyophilized powder that requires reconstitution in water prior to use. A 500 mL intravenous (IV) administration is used over 30 or 60 minutes for CLL and NHL patients, respectively. The product is sold in single use vials creating an opportunity for product waste in certain applications.
Eagle's Solution: Belrapzo and Bendeka
The Belrapzo and Bendeka liquid formulations eliminate the need to reconstitute the drug prior to use, relative to the lyophilized presentation of Treanda®. As a result, we believe that relative to the lyophilized presentation of Treanda® there is less potential for dosing errors, less exposure to cytotoxic powders and a more efficient work flow.
Additionally, admixtures prepared with Bendeka contain lower sodium as compared with Treanda® which could be of benefit to the predominantly elderly, renally impaired and cardiovascular compromised patients. Also, Bendeka is available in a multi-use vial, which allows infusion centers and hospitals to avoid needless waste of unused drug remaining after procedures with single use vials.
Belrapzo 
On May 15, 2018, the FDA granted final approval for Belrapzo, a ready-to-dilute, or RTD, multi-dose liquid with extended drug stability for use with a 500mL IV infusion bag.
License agreement with Cephalon
Bendeka is the same RTD, multi-dose liquid formulation as Belrapzo, with extended drug stability, but for use with a 50 mL IV infusion bag, which enables it to be administered in a shorter time-period than current drugs on the market and represents a label expansion from Belrapzo. We received orphan drug designation for Bendeka for CLL and NHL in July 2014. We entered into the Cephalon License to market this product. See License Agreements - Cephalon License Agreement, below.
License agreement with SymBio
On September 20, 2017, we entered into a product collaboration and license agreement, effective as of September 19, 2017 (the “SymBio License Agreement”), with SymBio Pharmaceuticals Limited, or SymBio, for the rights to develop and commercialize our bendamustine hydrochloride ready-to-dilute injection product and rapid infusion injection product in Japan. SymBio currently markets in Japan TREAKISYM, which was originally a lyophilized powder formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride. It is indicated for CLL, relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, as a first line treatment of low-grade NHL and MCL, and for relapsed-refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Under the SymBio License Agreement, SymBio may continue to market TREAKISYM in Japan and SymBio will be permitted to develop and market certain other bendamustine hydrochloride products in Japan for limited indications. 
Ryanodex® for Malignant Hyperthermia
Overview 
Dantrolene was first introduced to the U.S. market in 1979 and is currently the only drug approved to treat a rare genetic disorder called malignant hyperthermia, or MH. There are only estimated to be 500 to 800 cases of MH in the United States each year, qualifying dantrolene for orphan drug designation. This disease is triggered when a patient with this genetic predisposition has a surgical procedure and is exposed to certain inhaled anesthetics or the muscle relaxant, succinylcholine. When this exposure occurs, a metabolic response can be triggered in the patient resulting in an episode of MH that can be fatal if not treated immediately. Because dantrolene is the only approved drug available to treat MH, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or the Joint Commission, requires that all hospitals stock vials of this product at all times, generally in the operating room area. 
Competitive U.S. Marketed Products for MH
The two preexisting injectable dantrolene drugs on the U.S. market for the treatment of MH, Dantrium® and Revonto®, are offered in a vial containing 20mg of lyophilized powder that requires mixing with 60mL of sterile water. See “Business—Competition” and “Risk Factors—We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.”
Limitations of  Competitive U.S. Marketed Products
When an MH crisis occurs during surgery, the surgical procedure is immediately discontinued and the anesthesiologist and others in the operating room quickly begin reconstituting dantrolene, often at the same time as performing other resuscitative efforts, in order to administer the drug to the patient as an IV push. Based on recommendations from the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States, or MHAUS, the recognized authority on treating MH in the United States, the recommended dose is 2.5mg/kg or higher. It is critically important that the drug be administered as rapidly as possible, as MH symptoms include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, raised CO2 levels and very high body temperature levels. If not treated immediately, the disease can be fatal.
Because of the dosing required in adult patients to reverse the MH symptoms and the current formulations of Dantrium® and Revonto®, it is often necessary to reconstitute 10 to 20 vials of dantrolene. As the current formulations are also poorly water soluble, this process generally takes up to 15 to 20 minutes at a point when time is critical and the patient is extremely unstable. Furthermore, the volume of diluent required to reconstitute Dantrium® and Revonto® means that the adult patient receives a significant volume of fluid (600mL to 1,200mL) as an IV infusion, which on occasion can result in detrimental secondary physiological consequences for the patient, such as pulmonary edema and extravasation, which can lead to tissue necrosis.
Eagle's Solution: Ryanodex®
We have developed a differentiated formulation of dantrolene sodium that was approved by the FDA in July 2014 and is currently sold under the brand name, Ryanodex®, for the treatment of MH. The presentation is a 5ml vial containing 250mg of dantrolene sodium in lyophilized powder form.
We believe that the immediate benefits of our Ryanodex® formulation are clinically significant in critical care situations. Specifically, Ryanodex® reduces the amount of time to reconstitute and administer dantrolene from 15 to 20 minutes with Dantrium® and Revonto®, to 1 minute, as the anesthesiologist are able to mix and administer a dose of 250mg from a single vial of Ryanodex® in contrast to mixing and administering up to 12 or more vials of Dantrium® or Revonto®. A recent retrospective study conducted by MHAUS demonstrated that every 15-minute delay in treating MH resulted in a 7.8% increase in patient complications. 
EP-4104 Ryanodex® (dantrolene sodium) for the treatment of organophosphate exposure (Nerve Agents)
Organophosphates are a class of chemicals that include potent pesticides and chemical weapons, known as nerve agents. Acute intoxication with organophospates may result in severe consequences, including brain damage and death. Eagle is currently evaluating Ryanodex for the treatment of brain damage secondary to nerve agent, or NA, exposure. If approved, Ryanodex would represent the first product available for this indication. 
Limitations of Current Therapies
While the standard treatment of atropine and oxime is essential after exposure to a nerve agent, these drugs are not neuroprotective. There are currently no FDA-approved products that treat acute intoxication with organophospates that may result in severe consequences, including brain damage and death.
Eagle's Solution: Ryanodex
Ryanodex's presentation would initially be an injectable suspension. We believe that Ryanodex may provide significant benefits over the current standard of care, which may not be readily available in most settings. 
EP-4104 Clinical Development and Regulatory Status
In May 2019, we announced positive results of our study to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Ryanodex secondary to NA exposure, conducted with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense, the nation's leading science and technology laboratory in the area of medical chemical countermeasures research and development. The study results showed a p-value of 0.04 or less compared to the control group in six critical areas of the brain. We believe these results demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of Ryanodex. It has been hypothesized that nerve agent poisoning triggers intracellular calcium release in the body. The study data supports the proposed mechanism of action of Ryanodex, which modulates intracellular calcium in different organs including the brain.
On December 16, 2019, we announced that the FDA granted orphan drug designation, or ODD, for Ryanodex® (dantrolene sodium) for the treatment of organophosphate exposure. On August 8, 2020, we submitted a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to the FDA for Ryanodex for the treatment of brain damage secondary to nerve agent exposure. We are initiating dose ranging studies in another animal model using IV administration using an intermuscular formulation of EA-111. We expect the preliminary results from these studies, if positive, will allow us to update our SPA with the FDA. If approved, Ryanodex would represent the first product available for this indication.
PEMFEXY® for Lung Cancer
PEMFEXY is an IV-administered cancer agent indicated for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. We have developed PEMFEXY as a ready-to-use/dilute liquid form of pemetrexed that is available in a 25mg/mL per vial. Because our product is available in liquid form, product reconstitution is not required, making EP-5101 a preferred formulation under the Joint Commission guidelines. 
Competitive U.S. Marketed Pemetrexed Product
The branded form of a pemetrexed product is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, as Alimta. Alimta is approved for use to treat non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. Alimta's lyophilized formulation utilizes pemetrexed disodium. The product presentations for Alimta are 100mg and 500mg single use vials containing lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted before patient administration. Once mixed, Alimta must be used within 24 hours due to product stability concerns. See “Business—Competition” and “Risk Factors—We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.”
Limitations of Competitive U.S. Marketed Product
Alimta, a lyophilized pemetrexed disodium formulation requiring reconstitution, adds time to administration, presents cytotoxic safety issues for healthcare professionals administering the drug and the potential for dosing errors. Because reconstitution of Alimta is generally not performed until the patient has cleared all tests necessary to receive the drug, this process contributes to a significant amount of time spent by such patients in infusion clinics. Additionally, this method of administration limits the number of patients that may be treated on any given day by such clinics. Furthermore, as with any oncology drug, cytotoxic vapors released through reconstitution can be potentially harmful to pharmacists, physicians and nurses. Moreover, dosing errors may occur during reconstitution, as incorrect amounts of diluent may be used. As a result, lyophilized formulations are less preferred by the Joint Commission as compared to an RTD product.
Eagle's Solution: PEMFEXY®
PEMFEXY is an RTD liquid formulation of pemetrexed. As an RTD liquid formulation, PEMFEXY will not require additional time for reconstitution and may avoid certain safety concerns to healthcare professionals, including reducing exposure to the drug's cytotoxic vapors during reconstitution by healthcare providers, and potential dosing errors during mixing. This could allow for a more efficient work flow within the infusion clinic and may result in an opportunity to reduce office staff and see more patients each day.
We submitted an NDA for PEMFEXY on December 30, 2016 for use in non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. On October 27, 2017, we were granted tentative approval for PEMFEXY by the FDA. On December 13, 2019, we reached a settlement agreement with Lilly related to PEMFEXY. The agreement provided for a release of all claims by the parties and allowed for an initial entry of PEMFEXY into the market on February 1, 2022 and a subsequent uncapped entry on April 1, 2022. On February 10, 2020, we received final approval from the FDA for PEMFEXY. Following such approval, on February 1, 2022 we announced the commercial availability of PEMFEXY in the United States.
EA-114 (fulvestrant) for Breast Cancer
Fulvestrant is an injectable estrogen receptor antagonist. It is used for the treatment of hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer for post-menopausal women whose disease has progressed following treatment with prior endocrine therapy.
Competitive U.S. Marketed Product
The branded form of fulvestrant is Faslodex, a 500mg injectable product marketed by AstraZeneca plc. See “Business—Competition” and “Risk Factors—We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.”
Limitations of Competitive U.S. Marketed Product 
Faslodex is administered in two deep intramuscular injections of high viscosity product per dose of treatment (5 ml each) over 1-2 minutes into each buttock. The procedure is painful and Faslodex injection reactions have been associated with peripheral nerve adverse reactions, including risk of damaging the sciatic nerve.
Eagle’s Solution: EA-114
On August 5, 2019, we announced a clinical development plan to support the submission of a NDA for our fulvestrant formulation. Our original formulation of fulvestrant was studied in a clinical trial conducted in 2018 in healthy post-menopausal women. A detailed review of the study data led to the hypothesis that the unique properties of our formulation would potentially allow for greater inhibition of estrogen receptors. Based on this hypothesis, we completed additional work designed to further enhance our proprietary drug formulation. We met with the FDA and mutually agreed to a clinical program that could provide an efficient approval pathway for our fulvestrant formulation. The main goal of the clinical research program was to determine if the unique properties of our fulvestrant formulation would result in greater inhibition of estrogen receptors, potentially leading to improved efficacy outcomes, including lower disease progression rates, compared to current treatment options. 
On December 9, 2019, we announced that we had commenced dosing in a pilot clinical study to assess the unique characteristics of our fulvestrant product candidate, which has the potential to enhance estrogen receptorER, inhibition and improve patient outcomes.
Based on discussions with the FDA, we reformulated and plan to commence human pilot studies of our fulvestrant product candidate for the treatment of HR+/HER- advanced breast cancer shortly.
Other Opportunities
We are pursuing several additional potential products and product indications that address broad indications such as oncology, emergency medicine, infectious diseases and others. We intend to use our novel and well-developed methods to identify ideal development candidates and to commercialize improved formulations of widely prescribed therapeutics.
Sales and Marketing
Other than products subject to existing commercialization arrangements, we commercialize our product portfolio in the United States and Japan with our commercial organization. Ryanodex, Belrapzo, BARHEMSYS, BYFAVO, and PEMFEXY are marketed by our internal commercial team consisting of 55 direct sales representatives, and other support staff and management. During the first quarter of 2023, we decided to exit the vasopressin market by discontinuing all related manufacturing and halting sales beyond current inventory levels. Inventory on hand and in the distribution channel is expected to be depleted by the end of the second quarter of 2023.
Major Customer
We are dependent on our commercial partner, Teva, to market and sell Bendeka. As a result, our future revenues are highly dependent on our collaboration and distribution arrangement with Teva.
Teva markets Bendeka through the Cephalon License. Pursuant to that license agreement, Teva pays us a royalty based on net sales of the product and also purchases the product from us. A disruption in this arrangement caused by, among other things, a supply disruption, loss of exclusivity or the launch of a superior product would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The total revenues broken down by major customers as a percentage of the total are as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Total revenues | | | | | 
Teva | 33 | % | | 66 | % | 67 | %
Customer A | 19 | % | | 7 | % | 10 | %
Customer B | 12 | % | | 9 | % | 5 | %
Customer C | 12 | % | | 4 | % | 2 | %
Customer D | 9 | % | | 8 | % | 9 | %
Other | 15 | % | | 6 | % | 7 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Manufacturing
We do not own any manufacturing facilities. The manufacture of sterile injectables is highly reliant on very complex sterile techniques and personnel aseptic techniques which present significant challenges and requires specialized expertise. Further, sterile processes have a high level of scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Consequently, we utilize a network of third party manufacturers for production of our products. All manufacturers are monitored and evaluated by our quality department to assess compliance with regulatory requirements and our internal quality standards and benchmarks.
Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business. We seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our products or product candidates, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to our business model and maintaining a competitive advantage over generic competitors. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our products and product candidates.

Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
Trade secrets play an important role in protecting our products and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity. The scale-up and commercial manufacture of our products involves processes, custom equipment, and in-process and release analytical techniques that we believe are unique to us. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these security measures, individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our proprietary technology and processes may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors or any future collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring third parties with whom we contract for services related to our products, including manufacturing services to agree to 
terms in our agreements with such third parties that protect our confidential and trade secret information. We also require our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.

In addition, under the terms of the amendment, no royalty payment is due on Gross Profits 
derived from pemetrexed parenteral formulation that are less than $85,000,000. In exchange for the foregoing amended royalty rates, we made a one-time lump sum payment of $15,000,000 to Robert One on January 3, 2023.
License Agreement with Cephalon
On February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for Bendeka which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License with Cephalon, for U.S. and Canadian rights to Bendeka for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Subsequently, with our consent, Cephalon assigned to Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH, or TPIG, all of Cephalon’s rights and obligations under the Cephalon License. TPIG is responsible for preforming Cephalon’s obligations and has Cephalon’s rights under the agreement.. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, TPIG is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Additionally, under the terms of the Cephalon License, we received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, a $15 million milestone payment in January 2016 in connection with the FDA approval of Bendeka in December 2015, a $40 million milestone in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the receipt of the J-Code for Bendeka and in the first quarter of 2017, Bendeka reached $500 million in cumulative net sales, triggering an additional $25 million sales-based milestone payment. In addition, the royalty payments of 20% of net sales of the product that we were entitled to receive increased to 25% on receipt of the J-Code. In connection with the Cephalon License, we have entered into a supply agreement with TPIG, pursuant to which we are responsible for supplying product to TPIG. 
On April 13, 2019, we and Teva entered into an amendment to the Cephalon License, amending the terms of the License Agreement to increase the U.S. royalty paid to us and re-allocate certain litigation expenses. Pursuant to the Amendment, beginning on October 1, 2019,our royalty payment increased from 25% to 30% of Bendeka net United States sales. The royalty rate increased by one percentage point on  October 1, 2020, and will continue to increase by one percentage point on each anniversary of October 1, 2019 until it reaches 32%, and it will remain at 32% thereafter. The Amendment also extends the U.S. royalty term for Bendeka until it is no longer sold in the United States. The previous royalty term was set to expire in 2025. The extended term coincides with the bendamustine patents with expiries through 2033. Pursuant to the amendment, we will continue to be responsible for the manufacture of Bendeka for the U.S. market for so long as it is sold in the United States. Pursuant to the amendment, we have also agreed to assume a portion of Bendeka-related patent litigation expenses. 
In March 2019, we received an upfront cash payment of $9.0 million upon execution of an amendment to the Cephalon License to terminate Teva’s obligation to pay future milestones and royalties on Bendeka sales outside of the U.S. 
Cephalon Settlement
On February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon Settlement Agreement with Cephalon, in connection with the Cephalon License, pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the pending patent infringement claims against each other regarding Cephalon's US Patent No. 8,791,270, under which we agreed to enter into a Consent Judgment regarding the ‘270 patent. As part of the Cephalon Settlement Agreement, Cephalon has agreed to waive its orphan drug exclusivities for the treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL.
Product Collaboration and License Agreement with SymBio
On September 20, 2017, we entered into the SymBio License with SymBio for the rights to develop and commercialize EP-3101 and Bendeka, or collectively, the Products, in Japan. Under the SymBio License, SymBio is responsible for all development of the Products in Japan and for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals of the Products in Japan. SymBio bears all costs of development of the Products in Japan except that, if Japanese regulatory authorities require a certain clinical study to be conducted as a condition for approving one of the Products in Japan, we would share 50% of the out-of-pocket costs of that clinical study up to a specified dollar amount as a reduction to future royalty payments. Based on our assessment of the probability of additional costs, we have not deferred revenue on the SymBio License. SymBio will also be responsible, at its sole cost, for all marketing, promotion, distribution and sales of the Products in Japan and is obligated to launch the Products and meet certain minimum detailing, promotion and marketing commitments in connection with commercialization of the Products in Japan.
SymBio currently markets in Japan TREAKISYM, which was originally a lyophilized powder formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride. It is indicated for CLL, relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, as a first line treatment of low-grade NHL and MCL, and for relapsed-refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Under the SymBio License, 
SymBio may continue to market TREAKISYM in Japan and SymBio will be permitted to develop and market certain other bendamustine hydrochloride products in Japan for limited indications.
Pursuant to the terms of the SymBio License, we and SymBio will enter into a separate supply agreement, under which we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Products to SymBio for development and commercialization in Japan. After a period of time following launch of a Product, SymBio will have the right to assume the responsibility for manufacturing of the Products in and for Japan. Under the SymBio License, we will retain the right to control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents covering the Products, both inside and outside of Japan.
Under the SymBio License, we earned an upfront non-refundable cash payment of $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a $5.0 million milestone payment in the third quarter of 2020 when SymBio, received regulatory approval for TREAKISYM from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, in Japan. We are eligible to receive a milestone payment upon achievement of certain cumulative net sales of the Products in Japan. We will also receive tiered, low double-digit royalties on net sales of the Products in Japan for so long as there are patents covering the Products in Japan or regulatory exclusivity for the Products in Japan. Potential payments to us could reach $10 to $25 million per year in royalties and milestones. 
On September 23, 2020, we announced that SymBio had received approval for Treakisym RTD liquid formulation in Japan. The approval covered all indications for which TREAKISYM was approved for at the time (low-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Approval for the additional indication of relapsed-refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma was also granted. 
License Agreement with Combioxin
In August 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Combioxin, SA, or Combioxin, under which we were granted exclusive, worldwide development and commercialization rights to CAL02, a novel first-in-class anti-infective agent ready for Phase 2b/3 clinical trial development for the treatment of severe pneumonia in combination with traditional antibacterial drugs. We are solely responsible for the development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities of CAL02. Combioxin will assist us in transitioning the manufacturing and supply of CAL02 to the Company. 
Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $10 million. We may pay to Combioxin up to $105 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales based milestone payments plus royalty payments at royalty rates ranging in low double digit percentages on the net sales of all products sold, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the agreement. The Company is also obligated to make certain payments based upon amounts received by sublicensees under the agreement. 
License agreement with AOP Orphan
In August 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement with AOP Orphan, a privately owned Austrian company devoted to the treatment of rare and special diseases, for the commercial rights to its product, Landiolol in the United States. Landiolol, a leading hospital emergency use product, is currently approved in Europe for the treatment of non-compensatory sinus tachycardia and tachycardic supraventricular arrhythmias. We will support the submission of a NDA by AOP Orphan to the FDA seeking approval for Landiolol for the short term reduction of ventricular rate in patients with supraventricular tachycardia, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. On June 1, 2022, we announced that AOP Orphan, with whom we entered into a licensing agreement in August 2021, submitted an NDA to the FDA for landiolol, a short-acting, intravenous (“IV”), cardio-selective beta-1 adrenergic blocker [product candidate]. The submission seeks approval for landiolol for the short-term reduction of ventricular rate in patients with supraventricular tachycardia (“SVT”), including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. The FDA’s decision with respect to approval is expected in mid-2023. Patient enrollment for a study of pediatric patients with supraventricular tachycardia is underway in Europe.
Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $5 million. We may pay to AOP Orphan additional amounts upon achievement of certain regulatory milestone payments plus profit share payments, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the agreement. We also entered into a supply agreement at the same time as the licensing agreement. 
Enalare Transaction 
On August 8, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with and Enalare, pursuant to which we have committed to provide equity investments of up to $55 million in Enalare (the “Purchase Agreement”). Concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we, Enalare and holders of all of the outstanding capital stock, and any securities or options exercisable for capital stock, of Enalare (the “Securityholders”) entered into a Security Purchase Option Agreement, pursuant to 
which we have the option (the “Purchase Option”) to acquire all of the remaining outstanding shares of Enalare other than those already owned by us subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement (the “Option Agreement”).
The Securities Purchase Agreement
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we made two initial equity investments of $12.5 million each (the “Initial Investment”) in Enalare on August 8, 2022 and February 8, 2023, respectively, pursuant to which we acquired 24,902 shares of Enalare common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Enalare Common Stock”) on August 8, 2022. The Initial Investment is expected to support the research, development and commercialization of Enalare’s lead compound, ENA001, an agnostic respiratory stimulant for post-surgery respiratory depression. The Purchase Agreement further provides that upon the achievement of certain milestones, we will be required to make two additional equity investments in Enalare, each in an aggregate amount of $15 million. The first $15 million investment shall occur upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 human clinical trial of any product containing the active ingredient ENA-001 (a “Product Candidate”) (such investment, the “First Milestone Share Purchase”). If the First Milestone Share Purchase occurs, we would receive a number of shares representing approximately 9.8% of Enalare in exchange for the additional $15 million payment. The second $15 million investment shall occur when patient enrollment in the Phase 2 human clinical trial of a Product Candidate reaches 50% (the “Second Milestone Share Purchase” and, together with the First Milestone Share Purchase, the “Milestone Share Purchases”). If the Second Milestone Share Purchase occurs, we would receive a number of shares representing 9.5% of Enalare in exchange for the second additional $15 million payment. Should the completion of the Milestone Share Purchases occur, we would own approximately 33% of Enalare’s outstanding Enalare Common Stock.
We may terminate the Purchase Agreement following the closing of our second $12.5 million investment at any time in our sole and absolute discretion with thirty (30) days’ written notice to Enalare.
The Security Purchase Option Agreement
Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we have the option (but not the obligation) to acquire, in whole, all of the outstanding shares of Enalare other than those already owned by us (i) via a direct acquisition option or (ii) by entering into a definitive agreement with Enalare containing the terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the term sheet attached as Exhibit A to the Option Agreement, in each case for an amount equal to approximately $100 million to $175 million in the aggregate plus additional amounts as set forth in the agreement. The term of the Purchase Option (the “Option Period”) commenced on August 8, 2022 and will end upon the earlier of (x) 90 days following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) communication of proceed to clinical for a Phase 3 clinical study for a Product Candidate or (y) June 30, 2027. Enalare shall not initiate Phase 3 pivotal studies prior to the end of the Option Period and we shall have reasonable access to all relevant data and documents following the Phase 3 Milestone (as defined in the Option Agreement).
Pursuant to the Option Agreement, if a Priority Review Voucher were to be granted with respect to the first Product Candidate, (“PRV”), we would be required to pay to the Enalare stockholders at the time of closing 9-12% of all proceeds received from the sale of any such PRV. If we were to use the PRV, if any, for an application, we would be required to pay to the Enalare stockholders at the time of closing an agreed dollar amount.
We may terminate the Option Agreement at any time in our sole and absolute discretion with thirty (30) days’ written notice to Enalare.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. For example, Ryanodex, and products with dantrolene sodium as the API, is currently marketed in the United States by, among others, Endo International plc, Impax Laboratories, Inc., Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC, US WorldMeds, LLC, Mylan Institutional, LLC, and Elite Laboratories, Inc. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than products that we are currently selling through partners or developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product portfolio in our target 
commercial markets. See “Risk Factors—We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.”
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process for Drugs
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
•completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's current good laboratory practice, or cGLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or cGCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
•satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including cGLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key 
parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1:    In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.
Phase 2:    Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3:    Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an application is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved application is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under PDUFA the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA's goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A tentative approval is issued to a 505(b)(2) NDA if the sponsor must await the expiration of an Orange Book listed patent covering the reference product. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ("REMS") program 
to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug's risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS program can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.
Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act requirements for medicine identification, tracing and verification, among others, that are designed to detect and remove counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise potentially harmful drugs from the U.S. drug supply chain. A growing majority of states also impose certain drug pedigree requirements on the sale and distribution of prescription drugs.
The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious 
risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
ANDA Approval Process
The Hatch-Waxman Act established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an ANDA with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An "active moiety" is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance's physiological or pharmacological action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA's findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan indication for which it received the designation, it will not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure 
regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to numerous regulations by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA including, but not limited to, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and its various enforcement divisions, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, the Office for Human Research Protections, or OHRP, and the Office of Research Integrity, or ORI, state Attorneys General, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, or MFCUs, and other state and local government agencies. Healthcare laws and regulations that may govern our business include the following. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce in return for either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, recommendation, leasing, ordering or furnishing of a good, facility, item, or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, on the other. The term "remuneration" expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, which are narrowly drawn, protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability in all cases. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The ACA also provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Further, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The "qui tam" provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and potentially to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the federal civil False Claims Act. Many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government. There are many potential bases for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, and improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug's label. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several additional federal civil and 
criminal statutes that prohibit healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute 
prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended certain of these federal criminal statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain "covered entities," which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which expanded certain of HIPAA's privacy and security standards. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to "payments or other transfers of value" made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), generally, with some exceptions, other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations must also report annually to the CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. 
There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to health care professionals and health care entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Several states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers' use of identifiable data. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity obligations, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under these laws or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. 
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we also may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our approved product portfolio, as well as our pre-clinical and clinical product portfolio, if and when approved, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Sales of our product portfolio will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product portfolio will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and/or similar healthcare management organizations, or are reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The market for our product portfolio will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement.
Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Further, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. The cost of pharmaceuticals and medical devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor scrutiny. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience continued pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and administrative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third-party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative and administrative reforms.
Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product portfolio and to operate profitably.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payors' reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that will likely affect our future operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs, improve access, and improve quality. 
By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry included, among others, the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;
•new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line extension products;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, 
as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and,
•a new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling,, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and any additional healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact ACA.
Other healthcare legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, will remain in effect through 2031. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. For example, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example,  in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the 
negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business and/or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product portfolio or additional pricing pressures. 
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Data Privacy and Security Laws 
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal or sensitive data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or EU GDPR, the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom, or UK, law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, or UK GDPR, and the ePrivacy Directive. In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. 
The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for certain data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, CPRA, effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. 
Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory 
authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances. 
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 134 employees in the United States and one employee in the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We have built an internal commercial team consisting of 55 direct sales representatives, and other support staff and management who are a part of our independent commercial organization. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees, advisors and consultants. In addition to competitive base salaries, the other competitive benefits that we provide to employees include equity and cash incentive plans, retirement benefits, and paid vacation. The principal purposes of these employee benefits are to attract, retain, reward and motivate our personnel and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of employees with the interests of our stockholders.
