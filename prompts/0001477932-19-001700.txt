ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS
 
We are an acquisition holding company focused on acquiring and managing a group of small businesses, which we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than $50 million, in a variety of different industries headquartered in North America. Through our subsidiaries, we currently provide products and services to the agriculture, construction, lawn and garden industries, which we refer to as our land application business. Through our structure, we plan to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or large conglomerates. We believe that our management and acquisition strategies will allow us to achieve our goals to begin making and growing regular monthly distributions to our shareholders and increasing shareholder value over time. 
 
We seek to acquire controlling interests in small businesses that we believe operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, and that have positive and stable earnings and cash flows, face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence and have strong management teams largely in place. We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their businesses will consider us to be an attractive purchaser of their businesses. Like we did when we acquired our land application business, we intend to make these future businesses our majority-owned subsidiaries and intend to actively manage and grow such businesses. We expect to improve our businesses over the long term through organic growth opportunities, add-on acquisitions and operational improvements. 
 
Market Opportunity
 
We seek to acquire and manage small businesses, which we characterize as those that have an enterprise value of less than $50 million. We believe that the merger and acquisition market for small businesses is highly fragmented and provides significant opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive prices. For example, according to GF Data, platform acquisitions with enterprise values greater than $50.0 million commanded valuation premiums 30% higher than platform acquisitions with enterprise values less than $50.0 million (8.2x trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA versus 6.3x trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA, respectively). 
 
We believe that the following factors contribute to lower acquisition multiples for small businesses:
 


· | there are typically fewer potential acquirers for these businesses; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | third-party financing generally is less available for these acquisitions; 
· | sellers of these businesses may consider non-economic factors, such as continuing board membership or the effect of the sale on their employees; and
· | these businesses are generally less frequently sold pursuant to an auction process. 

 
We believe that our management team’s strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offers us substantial opportunities to purchase small businesses. See “—Our Manager—Key Personnel of our Manager” for more information about our management team.
 
We also believe that significant opportunities exist to improve the performance of the businesses upon their acquisition. In the past, our manager has acquired businesses that are often formerly owned by seasoned entrepreneurs or large corporate parents. In these cases, our manager has frequently found that there have been opportunities to further build upon the management teams of acquired businesses. In addition, our manager has frequently found that financial reporting and management information systems of acquired businesses may be improved, both of which can lead to substantial improvements in earnings and cash flow. Finally, because these businesses tend to be too small to have their own corporate development efforts, we believe opportunities exist to assist these businesses in meaningful ways as they pursue organic or external growth strategies that were often not pursued by their previous owners.

Our Strategy 
 
Our long-term goals are to begin making and growing monthly distributions to our shareholders and to increase shareholder value over the long-term. We acquired Neese primarily so that we can achieve a base of cash flow to build our company and begin making and growing monthly distributions. We believe this acquisition will help us achieve our long-term goals.
 
We plan to continue focusing on acquiring other businesses. Therefore, we intend to continue to identify, perform due diligence on, negotiate and consummate platform acquisitions of small businesses in attractive industry sectors. 
 
Unlike buyers of small businesses that rely on significant leverage to consummate acquisitions (as demonstrated by the data below), we plan to limit the use of third party (i.e., external) acquisition leverage so that our debt will not exceed the market value of the assets we acquire and so that our debt to EBITDA ratio will not exceed 1.25x to 1 for our operating subsidiaries. We believe that limiting leverage in this manner will avoid the imposition on stringent lender controls on our operations that would otherwise potentially hamper the growth of our operating subsidiaries and otherwise harm our business even during times when we have positive operating cash flows. Additionally, in our experience, leverage rarely leads to “break-out” returns and often creates negative return outcomes that are not correlated with the profitability of the business.

In addition to acquiring businesses, we expect to sell businesses that we own from time to time when attractive opportunities arise. Upon the sale of a business, we may use the resulting proceeds to retire debt or retain proceeds for future acquisitions or general purposes. Generally, we do not expect to make special distributions at the time of a sale of one of our businesses; instead, we expect that we will seek to gradually increase monthly shareholder distributions over time.

Management Strategy
 
Our management strategy involves the identification, performance of due diligence, negotiation and consummation of acquisitions. After acquiring businesses, we will attempt to grow the businesses both organically and through add-on or bolt-on acquisitions. Add-on or bolt-on acquisitions are acquisitions by a company of other companies in the same industry. Following the acquisition of companies, we will seek to grow the earnings and cash flow of acquired companies and, in turn, begin making and growing regular monthly distributions to our shareholders and to increase shareholder value over time. We believe we can increase the cash flows of our businesses by applying our intellectual capital to improve and grow our future businesses. 
 
We will seek to acquire and manage small businesses. We believe that the merger and acquisition market for small businesses is highly fragmented and provides opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive prices. We believe we will be able to acquire small businesses for multiples ranging from three to six times EBITDA. We also believe, and our manager has historically found, that significant opportunities exist to improve the performance of these businesses upon their acquisition. 
 
In general, our manager will oversee and support the management team of our future platform businesses by, among other things: 
 


· | recruiting and retaining managers to operate our future businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems;
· | assisting the management teams of our future businesses in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies 
· | identifying and working with future business management teams to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; 
· | identifying and executing operational improvements and integration opportunities that will lead to lower operating costs and operational optimization; 
· | providing the management teams of our future businesses the opportunity to leverage our experience and expertise to develop and implement business and operational strategies; and 
· | forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management teams in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives. 

 
We also believe that our long-term perspective provides us with certain additional advantages, including the ability to: 
 


· | recruit and develop management teams for our future businesses that are familiar with the industries in which our future businesses operate;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | focus on developing and implementing business and operational strategies to build and sustain shareholder value over the long term; 
· | create sector-specific businesses enabling us to take advantage of vertical and horizontal acquisition opportunities within a given sector; 
· | achieve exposure in certain industries in order to create opportunities for future acquisitions; and 
· | develop and maintain long-term collaborative relationships with customers and suppliers. 

 
We intend to continually increase our intellectual capital as we operate our businesses and acquire new businesses and as our manager identifies and recruits qualified operating partners and managers for our businesses.

Acquisition Strategy 
 
Our acquisition strategies involve the acquisition of small businesses in various industries that we expect will produce positive and stable earnings and cash flow, as well as achieve attractive returns on our invested capital. In this respect, we expect to make acquisitions in industries wherein we believe an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity from the perspective of both (i) return on assets or equity and (ii) an easily identifiable path for growing the acquired businesses. We believe that attractive opportunities will increasingly present themselves as private sector owners seek to monetize their interests in longstanding and privately-held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their “non-core” operations. 
 
We believe that the greatest opportunities for generating consistently positive annual returns and, ultimately, residual returns on capital invested in acquisitions will result from targeting capital light businesses operating in niche geographical markets with a clearly identifiable competitive advantage within the following industries: business services, consumer services, consumer products, consumable industrial products, industrial services, niche light manufacturing, distribution, alternative/specialty finance and in select cases, specialty retail. While we believe that the professional experience of our management team within the industries identified above will offer the greatest number of acquisition opportunities, we will not eschew opportunities if a business enjoys an inarguable moat around its products and services in an industry which our management team may have less familiarity.
 
From a financial perspective, we expect to make acquisitions of small businesses that are stable, have minimal bad debt, and strong accounts receivable. In addition, we expect to acquire companies that have been able to generate positive pro forma cash available for distribution for a minimum of three years prior to acquisition.
 
We expect to benefit from our manager’s ability to identify diverse acquisition opportunities in a variety of industries. In addition, we intend to rely upon our management teams’ experience and expertise in researching and valuing prospective target businesses, as well as negotiating the ultimate acquisition of such target businesses. In particular, because there may be a lack of information available about these target businesses, which may make it more difficult to understand or appropriately value such target businesses, we expect our manager will:
 


· | engage in a substantial level of internal and third-party due diligence; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | critically evaluate the management team; 
· | identify and assess any financial and operational strengths and weaknesses of any target business; 
· | analyze comparable businesses to assess financial and operational performances relative to industry competitors;
· | actively research and evaluate information on the relevant industry; and 
· | thoroughly negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of any acquisition. 

 
We expect the process of acquiring new businesses to be time-consuming and complex. Our manager has historically taken from 2 to 24 months to perform due diligence on, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although we expect our manager to be at various stages of evaluating several transactions at any given time, there may be significant periods of time during which it does not recommend any new acquisitions to us.
 
Upon an acquisition of a new business, we intend to rely on our manager’s experience and expertise to work efficiently and effectively with the management of the new business to jointly develop and execute a business plan.
 
While we will primarily seek to acquire controlling interests in a business, we may also acquire non-control or minority equity positions in businesses where we believe it is consistent with our long-term strategy. 
 
As discussed in more detail below, we intend to raise capital for additional acquisitions primarily through debt financing, primarily at our operating company level, additional equity offerings by our company, the sale of all or a part of our businesses or by undertaking a combination of any of the above. 
 
In addition to acquiring businesses, we expect to sell businesses that we own from time to time when attractive opportunities arise. Our decision to sell a business will be based on our belief that the sale will provide our shareholders with a more favorable return on the investment than continued ownership, and will be consistent with the disposition criteria to be established by our company’s board of directors from time to time. Upon the sale of a business, we may use the resulting proceeds to retire debt or retain proceeds for future acquisitions or general purposes. Generally, we do not expect to make special distributions at the time of a sale of one of our businesses; instead, we expect that we will seek to gradually increase monthly shareholder distributions over time.

There are several risks associated with our acquisition strategy, including the following risks, which are described more fully in “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure”:
 


· | we may not be able to successfully fund future acquisitions of new businesses due to the unavailability of debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, which could impede the implementation of our acquisition strategy; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | we may experience difficulty as we evaluate, acquire and integrate future businesses that we may acquire, which could result in drains on our resources, including the attention of our management, and disruptions of our on-going business;
· | we face competition for businesses that fit our acquisition strategy and, therefore, we may have to acquire targets at sub-optimal prices or, alternatively, forego certain acquisition opportunities; and 
· | we may change our management and acquisition strategies without the consent of our shareholders, which may result in a determination by us to pursue riskier business activities. 

Strategic Advantages
 
Based on the experience of our manager and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we expect to be strongly positioned to acquire additional businesses. Our manager has strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities. In negotiating these acquisitions, we believe our manager will be able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. 
 
We expect that the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our manager in structuring transactions will provide us with strategic advantages by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target. 
 
Our manager also has a large network of deal intermediaries who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, we expect to have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. Our manager also has a well-established network of contacts, including professional managers, attorneys, accountants and other third-party consultants and advisors, who may be available to assist us in the performance of due diligence and the negotiation of acquisitions, as well as the management and operation of our businesses once acquired. 
 
Valuation and Due Diligence
 
When evaluating businesses or assets for acquisition, we will perform a rigorous due diligence and financial evaluation process. In doing so, we will seek to evaluate the operations of the target business as well as the outlook for the industry in which the target business operates. While valuation of a business is, by definition, a subjective process, we will be defining valuations under a variety of analyses, including: 

· | discounted cash flow analyses; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
· | evaluation of trading values of comparable companies; 
· | expected value matrices; 
· | assessment of competitor, supplier and customer environments; and
· | examination of recent/precedent transactions. 

 
One outcome of this process is an effort to project the expected cash flows from the target business as accurately as possible. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that our detailed due diligence review process allows us to more accurately estimate future cash flows and more effectively evaluate the prospects for operating the business in the future. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we intend to engage third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We may also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary.

A further critical component of the evaluation of potential target businesses will be the assessment of the capability of the existing management team, including recent performance, expertise, experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we will actively seek to augment, supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute the business plan for the target business. Similarly, we will analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we will actively seek to enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for the target business. 
 
Financing
 
We will finance future acquisitions primarily through additional equity and debt financings. We believe that having the ability to finance most, if not all, acquisitions with the general capital resources raised by our company, rather than financing relating to the acquisition of individual businesses, provides us with an advantage in acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In this respect, we believe that, at some point in the future, we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financings, or offer equity in our company or target businesses to the sellers of such target businesses, in order to fund acquisitions.
Our Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that our manager’s collective investment experience and approach to executing our investment strategy provide our company with several competitive advantages. These competitive advantages, certain of which are discussed below, have enabled our management to generate very attractive risk- adjusted returns for investors in their predecessor firms.
Robust Network. Through their activities with their predecessor firms and their comprehensive marketing capabilities, we believe that the management team of our manager has established a “top of mind” position among investment bankers and business brokers targeting small businesses. By employing an institutionalized, multi-platform marketing strategy, we believe our manager has established a robust national network of personal relationships with intermediaries, seasoned operating executives, entrepreneurs and managers, thereby firmly establishing our company’s presence and credibility in the small business market. In contrast to many other buyers of and investors in small businesses, we believe that we can buy businesses at value-oriented multiples and through our asset management activities with a group of professional, experienced and talented operating partners, create appreciable value. We believe our experience, track record and consistent execution of our marketing and investment activities will allow us to maintain a leadership position as the preferred partner for today’s small business market.
Disciplined Deal Sourcing. We employ an institutionalized, multi-platform approach to sourcing new acquisition opportunities. Our deal sourcing efforts include leveraging relationships with more than 3,000 qualified deal sources through regular calling, mail and e-mail campaigns, assignment of regional marketing responsibilities, in-person visits and high-profile sponsorship of important conferences and industry events. We supplement these activities by retaining selected intermediary firms to conduct targeted searches for opportunities in specific categories on an opportunistic basis. As a result of the significant time and effort spent on these activities, we believe we established close relationships and unique “top of mind” awareness with many of the most productive intermediary sources for small business acquisition opportunities in the United States. While reinforcing our market leadership, this capability enables us to generate a large number of attractive acquisition opportunities. 
Differentiated Acquisition Capabilities in the Small Business Market. We deploy a differentiated approach to acquiring businesses in the small business market. Our management concentrates their efforts on mature companies with sustainable value propositions, which can be supported by our resources and institutional expertise. Our evaluation of acquisition opportunities typically involves significant input from a seasoned operating partner with relevant experience, which we believe enhances both our diligence and ongoing monitoring capabilities. In addition, we approach every acquisition opportunity with creative structures, which we believe enables us to engineer mutually attractive scenarios for sellers, whereas competing buyers may be limited by their rigid structural requirements. We believe our commitment to conservative capital structures and valuation will enhance each acquired operating subsidiary’s ability to deliver consistent levels of cash available for distribution, while additionally supporting reinvestment for growth.

10

Value Proposition for Business Owners. We employ a creative, flexible approach by tailoring each acquisition structure to meet the specific liquidity needs and certain qualitative objectives of the target’s owners and management team. In addition to serving as an exit pathway for sellers, we seek to align our interests with the sellers by enabling them to retain and/or earn (through incentive compensation) a substantial economic interest in their businesses following the acquisition and by typically allowing the incumbent management team to retain operating control of the acquired operating subsidiary on a day-to-day basis. We believe that our company is an appealing buyer for small business owners and managers due to our track record of capitalizing portfolio companies conservatively, enhancing our ability to execute on its strategic initiatives and adding equity value. As a result, we believe business owners and managers will find in our company to be a dynamic, value-added buyer that brings considerable resources to achieve their strategic, capital and operating needs, resulting in substantial value creation for the operating subsidiary.
Operating Partner. Our manager has consistently worked with a strong network of seasoned operating partners - former entrepreneurs and executives with extensive experience building, managing and optimizing successful small businesses across a range of industries. We believe that our operating partner model will enable our company to make a significant improvement in the operating subsidiary, as compared to other buyers, such as traditional private equity firms, which rely principally upon investment professionals to make acquisition/investment and monitoring decisions regarding not only the business, financial and legal due diligence aspects of a business but also the more operational aspects including industry dynamics, management strength and strategic growth initiatives. We typically engage an operating partner soon after identifying a target business for acquisition, enhancing our acquisition judgment and building the acquisition team’s relationship with the subsidiary’s management team. Operating partners usually serve as a member of the board of directors of an operating subsidiary and spend two to four days per month working with the subsidiary’s management team. We leverage the operating partner’s extensive experience to build the management team, improve operations and assist with strategic growth initiatives, resulting in value creation.
Small Business Market Experience. We believe the history and experience of our manager’s partnering with companies in the small business market allows us to identify highly attractive acquisition opportunities and add significant value to our operating subsidiaries. Our manager’s investment experience in the small business market prior to forming our company has further contributed to our institutional expertise in the acquisition, strategic and operational decisions critical to the long-term success of small businesses. Since 2000, the management team of our manager has collectively been presented with several thousand investment opportunities and actively worked with more than 30 small businesses on all facets of their strategy, development and operations, which we have successfully translated into unique, institutionalized capabilities directed towards creating value in small businesses.

RECENT DEVEOPMENTS
 
Goedeker Transaction and Related Financing
 
Closing of Goedeker Acquisition
 
On January 18, 2019, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary 1847 Goedeker Inc., or 1847 Goedeker, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Goedeker Television Co., Inc., a Missouri corporation, or Goedeker, and Steve Goedeker and Mike Goedeker (referred to herein as the Stockholders), pursuant to which 1847 Goedeker agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of Goedeker used in its retail appliance and furniture business (referred to herein as the Goedeker Business) for the purchase price described below (we refer to such acquisition as the Goedeker Acquisition). 
 
On March 20, 2019, we formed 1847 Goedeker Holdco Inc., or 1847 Holdco, as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Delaware and then we transferred all of our shares in 1847 Goedeker to 1847 Holdco, such that 1847 Goedeker became a wholly-owned subsidiary of 1847 Holdco. 
 
On April 5, 2019, 1847 Goedeker, 1847 Holdco, Goedeker and the Stockholders entered into an amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement (we refer to such agreement as amended as the Goedeker Purchase Agreement) and closing of the Acquisition was completed.

Goedeker (www.goedekers.com), headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a one-stop e-commerce destination for home furnishings, including appliances, furniture, bath and kitchen fixtures, décor, lighting and home goods. Founded in 1951, Goedeker has evolved from a local brick and mortar operation serving the St. Louis metro area to a large nationwide omnichannel retailer. While Goedeker still maintains its St. Louis showroom, over 90% of sales are placed through its website. Goedeker offers over 500,000 SKUs organized by category and product features, providing visitors to the site an easy to navigate shopping experience. In 2017, total sales reached approximately $59 million (unaudited) comprised of appliances (73%), furniture (21%) and other product lines.
 
The aggregate purchase price is $6,200,000 consisting of: (i) $1,500,000 in cash, subject to adjustment; (ii) the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $4,100,000; and (iii) up to $600,000 in Earn Out Payments (as defined below). As additional consideration, 1847 Holdco agreed to issue to each of the Stockholders a number of shares of its common stock equal to a 11.25% non-dilutable interest in all of the issued and outstanding stock of 1847 Holdco as of the closing date.
 
The cash portion was decreased by the amount of outstanding indebtedness of Goedeker for borrowed money existing as of the closing. As a result, the cash portion was adjusted to $478,000. In addition, the cash portion of the purchase price is subject to a customary post-closing working capital adjustment provision with a target working capital of -$1,802,000 (negative amount).
 
As noted above, a portion of the purchase price was paid by the issuance by 1847 Goedeker of a 9% Subordinated Promissory Note in the principal amount of $4,100,000, or the Goedeker Note. The Goedeker Note will accrue interest at 9% per annum, amortized on a five-year straight-line basis and payable quarterly in accordance with the amortization schedule attached thereto, and mature on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the closing date. 1847 Goedeker has the right to redeem all or any portion of the Goedeker Note at any time prior to the maturity date without premium or penalty of any kind. The Goedeker Note contains customary events of default, including in the event of (i) non-payment, (ii) a default by 1847 Goedeker of any of its covenants under the Goedeker Purchase Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with the Goedeker Purchase Agreement, or a breach of any of representations or warranties under such documents, or (iii) the bankruptcy of 1847 Goedeker. The Goedeker Note also contains a cross default provision, whereby a default under the Revolving Loan or Term Loan (each as described below), will also constitute an event of default under the Goedeker Note.
 
Goedeker is also entitled to receive the following payments (referred to as the Earn Out Payments) to the extent the Goedeker Business achieves the applicable EBITDA (as defined in the Goedeker Purchase Agreement) targets:
 


1. | An Earn Out Payment of $200,000 if the EBITDA of the Goedeker Business for the trailing twelve (12) month period from the closing date is $2,500,000 or greater; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | An Earn Out Payment of $200,000 if the EBITDA of the Goedeker Business for the trailing twelve (12) month period from the first anniversary of closing date is $2,500,000 or greater; and 
3. | An Earn Out Payment of $200,000 if the EBITDA of the Goedeker Business for the trailing twelve (12) month period from the second anniversary of the closing date is $2,500,000 or greater.

 
To the extent the EBITDA of the Goedeker Business for any applicable period is less than $2,500,000 but greater than $1,500,000, 1847 Goedeker must pay a partial Earn Out Payment to Goedeker in an amount equal to the product determined by multiplying (i) the EBITDA Achievement Percentage by (ii) the applicable Earn Out Payment for such period, where the “Achievement Percentage” is the percentage determined by dividing (A) the amount of (i) the EBITDA of the Goedeker Business for the applicable period less (ii) $1,500,000, by (B) $1,000,000. For avoidance of doubt, no partial Earn Out Payments shall be earned or paid to the extent the EBITDA of the Goedeker Business for any applicable period is equal or less than $1,500,000.
 
To the extent Goedeker is entitled to all or a portion of an Earn Out Payment, the applicable Earn Out Payment(s) (or portion thereof) shall be paid on the date that is three (3) years from the closing date, and shall accrue interest from the date on which it is determined Goedeker is entitled to such Earn Out Payment (or portion thereof) at a rate equal to five percent (5%) per annum, computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed. 
 
During the earn out periods stated above, 1847 Goedeker agreed to (i) operate the Goedeker Business in the ordinary course of business substantially consistent with past practices, (ii) operate the Goedeker Business as a distinct business entity or division so that its results can be verified for purposes of calculating the Earn Out Payment, and (iii) adequately fund the Goedeker Business during the periods. Furthermore, 1847 Goedeker agreed that it would not, directly or indirectly, take any actions in bad faith that would have the purpose of avoiding the Earn Out Payment.

The rights of Goedeker to receive payments under the Goedeker Note and any Earn Out Payments are subordinate to the rights of Burnley Capital LLC and Small Business Community Capital II, L.P. under separate Subordination Agreements that Goedeker entered into with them on April 5, 2019 in connection with the Acquisition. 
 
The Goedeker Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a covenant that Goedeker and the Stockholders will not compete with the Goedeker Business for a period of three (3) years following closing. In addition, 1847 Goedeker provided the Stockholders with certain rights to participate in future stock issuances of 1847 Goedeker.
 
The Goedeker Purchase Agreement also contains mutual indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties and failure to perform covenants or obligations contained in the Goedeker Purchase Agreement. Goedeker and the Stockholders also indemnified 1847 Goedeker for (i) any Excluded Liability (as defined in the Goedeker Purchase Agreement) and (ii) any liability of Goedeker which is not an Assumed Liability (as defined in the Goedeker Purchase Agreement) and which is imposed upon 1847 Goedeker under any bulk transfer law of any jurisdiction or under any common law doctrine of de facto merger or successor liability so long as such liability arises out of the ownership, use or operation of the assets of Goedeker, or the operation or conduct of the Goedeker Business prior to the closing. 1847 Goedeker also indemnified Goedeker and the Stockholders for (i) any Assumed Liability and (ii) any liability (other than any Excluded Liability) asserted by a third party against any of Goedeker or the Stockholders which arises out of the ownership of the Purchased Assets (as defined in the Goedeker Purchase Agreement) after the closing or the operation by 1847 Goedeker of the business conducted with the Purchased Assets after the closing. 
 
In the case of the indemnification provided with respect to breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties, the party will only become liable for indemnified losses if the amount exceeds an aggregate of $50,000, whereupon such party will be liable for all losses relating back to the first dollar. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this threshold limitation shall not apply to claims by 1847 Goedeker for breaches by Goedeker or the Stockholders of certain fundamental representations. Furthermore, 1847 Goedeker’s aggregate remedy with respect to any and all claims for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants by Goedeker or the Stockholders shall not exceed $2,000,000. 1847 Goedeker’s only recourse for indemnification is to set-off the amount of any claims against the amounts due to Goedeker under the note or that would otherwise be owed to Goedeker under the Earn Out Payments.
 
Pursuant to the Goedeker Purchase Agreement, on April 5, 2019, 1847 Goedeker entered into a Lease Agreement, or the Lease, with S.H.J., L.L.C., a Missouri limited liability company and affiliate of Goedeker. The Lease is for a term five (5) years and provides for a base rent of $45,000 per month. In addition, 1847 Goedeker is responsible for all taxes and insurance premiums during the lease term. In the event of late payment, interest shall accrue on the unpaid amount at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. The Lease contains customary events of default, including if: (i) 1847 Goedeker shall fail to pay rent within five (5) days after the due date; (ii) any insurance required to be maintained by 1847 Goedeker pursuant to the Lease shall be canceled, terminated, expire, reduced, or materially changed; (iii) 1847 Goedeker shall fail to comply with any term, provision, or covenant of the Lease and shall not begin and pursue with reasonable diligence the cure of such failure within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof to 1847 Goedeker; (iv) 1847 Goedeker shall become insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or file a petition under any section or chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, or under any similar law or statute of the United States of America or any State thereof; or (v) a receiver or trustee shall be appointed for the leased premises or for all or substantially all of the assets of 1847 Goedeker.

On April 5, 2019, 1847 Goedeker, as borrower, and 1847 Holdco entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Revolving Loan Agreement, with Burnley Capital LLC, or Burnley, for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount that will not exceed the lesser of (i) the Borrowing Base or (ii) $1,500,000 (provided that such amount may be increased to $3,000,000 in Burnley’s sole discretion) (which we refer to as the Revolving Loan Amount) minus reserves established Burnley at any time, or the Reserves, in accordance with the Revolving Loan Agreement (which we refer to as the Revolving Loan). The Borrowing Base means an amount equal to the sum of the following: (i) the product of 85% multiplied by the liquidation value of 1847 Goedeker’s inventory (net of all liquidation costs) identified in the most recent inventory appraisal by an appraiser acceptable to Burnley (ii) multiplied by 1847 Goedeker’s Eligible Inventory (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement), valued at the lower of cost or market value, determined on a first-in-first-out basis. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition on April 5, 2019, 1847 Goedeker borrowed $744,000 under the Revolving Loan Agreement and issued a Revolving Note to Burnley in the principal amount of up to $1,500,000. 

13

 
The Revolving Note matures on April 5, 2022, provided that at Burnley’s sole and absolute discretion, it may agree to extend the maturity date for two successive terms of one year each. The Revolving Note bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement) plus 6.00% or (ii) 8.50%; provided that upon an Event of Default (as defined below) all loans, all past due interest and all fees shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the foregoing rate plus 3.00%. 1847 Goedeker shall pay interest accrued on the Revolving Note in arrears on the last day of each month commencing on April 30, 2019. 
 
1847 Goedeker may at any time and from time to time prepay the Revolving Note in whole or in part. If at any time the outstanding principal balance on the Revolving Note exceeds the lesser of (i) the difference of the Revolving Facility Amount minus any Reserves and (ii) the Borrowing Base, then 1847 Goedeker shall immediately prepay the Revolving Note in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. In addition, in the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement) are received by or on behalf of 1847 Goedeker or 1847 Holdco in respect of any Prepayment Event following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, 1847 Goedeker shall, immediately after such Net Proceeds are received, prepay the Revolving Note in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds. A Prepayment Event means (i) any sale, transfer, merger, liquidation or other disposition (including pursuant to a sale and leaseback transaction) of any property of 1847 Goedeker or 1847 Holdco; (ii) a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement); (iii) any casualty or other insured damage to, or any taking under power of eminent domain or by condemnation or similar proceeding of, any property of 1847 Goedeker or 1847 Holdco with a fair value immediately prior to such event equal to or greater than $25,000; (iv) the issuance by 1847 Goedeker of any capital stock or the receipt by 1847 Goedeker of any capital contribution; or (v) the incurrence by 1847 Goedeker or 1847 Holdco of any Indebtedness (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement), other than Indebtedness permitted under the Revolving Loan Agreement.
 
Under the Revolving Loan Agreement, 1847 Goedeker is required to pay a number of fees to Burnley, including the following:
 


· | an origination fee of $15,000, which was paid at closing on April 5, 2019; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a commitment fee during the period from closing to the earlier of the maturity date or termination of Burnley’s commitment to make loans under the Revolving Loan Agreement, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.50% per annum on the average daily difference of the Revolving Facility Amount then in effect minus the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the Burney Note, which such accrued commitment fees are due and payable in arrears on the first day of each calendar month and on the date on which Burnley’s commitment to make loans under the Revolving Loan Agreement terminates, commencing on the first such date to occur after the closing date; 
· | an annual loan facility fee equal to 0.75% of the Revolving Commitment (i.e., the maximum amount that 1847 Goedeker may borrow under the Revolving Loan), which is fully earned on the closing date for the term of the loan (including any extension) but shall be due and payable on each anniversary of the closing date; 
· | a monthly collateral management fee for monitoring and servicing the Revolving Loan equal to $1,700 per month for the term of Revolving Note, which is fully earned and non-refundable as of the date of the Revolving Loan Agreement, but shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each calendar month; provided that payment of the collateral management fee may be made, at the discretion of Burnley, by application of advances under the Revolving Loan or directly by 1847 Goedeker; and 
· | if the Revolving Loan is terminated for any reason, including by Burnley following an Event of Default, then 1847 Goedeker shall pay, as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of being prepared to make funds available, an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage multiplied by the Revolving Commitment (i.e., the maximum amount that 1847 Goedeker may borrow under the Revolving Loan), wherein the term Applicable Percentage means (i) 3%, in the case of a termination on or prior to the first anniversary of the closing date, (ii) 2%, in the case of a termination after the first anniversary of the closing date but on or prior to the second anniversary thereof, and (iii) 0.5%, in the case of a termination after the second anniversary of the closing date but on or prior to the maturity date.

 
In addition to the foregoing, 1847 Goedeker was required under the Revolving Loan Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement described below to pay a consulting fee of $150,000 to GVC Financial Services, LLC at closing.

The Revolving Loan Agreement contains customary events of default, including, among others (each of which is referred to as an Event of Default): (i) for failure to pay principal and interest on the Revolving Note when due, or to pay any fees due under the Revolving Loan Agreement; (ii) if any representation, warranty or certification in the Revolving Loan Agreement or any document delivered in connection therewith is incorrect in any material respect; (iii) for failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in the Revolving Loan Agreement or any document delivered in connection therewith; (iv) for the occurrence of any default in respect of any other Indebtedness of more than $100,000; (v) for any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution; (vi) for the occurrence of one or more judgments, non-interlocutory orders, decrees or arbitration awards involving in the aggregate a liability of $25,000 or more; (vii) if 1847 Goedeker or 1847 Holdco, or officer thereof, is charged by a governmental authority, criminally indicted or convicted of a felony under any law that would reasonably be expected to lead to forfeiture of any material portion of collateral, or such entity is subject to an injunction restraining it from conducting its business; (viii) if Burnley determines that a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement) has occurred; (ix) if a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Loan Agreement) occurs; (x) if there is any material damage to, loss, theft or destruction of property which causes, for more than thirty consecutive days beyond the coverage period of any applicable business interruption insurance, the cessation or substantial curtailment of revenue producing activities; (xi) if there is a loss, suspension or revocation of, or failure to renew any permit if it could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (xii) for the occurrence of any default or event of default under the Term Loan (as defined below), the Goedeker Note, the Leonite Note (as defined below) or any other debt that is subordinated to the Revolving Loan.
 
The Revolving Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative financial and other covenants for a loan of this type. The Revolving Note is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the assets of 1847 Goedeker and 1847 Holdco. In connection with such security interest, on April 5, 2019, (i) 1847 Holdco entered into a Pledge Agreement with Burnley, pursuant to which 1847 Holdco pledged the shares of 1847 Goedeker held by it to Burnley, and (ii) 1847 Goedeker entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement with Burnley, Small Business Community Capital II, L.P. and Montgomery Bank relating to the security interest in 1847 Goedeker’s bank accounts.
 
In addition, on April 5, 2019, our company entered into a Guaranty with Burnley to guaranty the obligations under the Revolving Loan Agreement upon the occurrence of certain prohibited acts described in the Guaranty.
 
Term Loan
 
On April 5, 2019, 1847 Goedeker, as borrower, and 1847 Holdco entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Term Loan Agreement, with Small Business Community Capital II, L.P., or SBCC, for a term loan in the principal amount of $1,500,000 (which we refer to as the Term Loan), pursuant to which 1847 Goedeker issued to SBCC a Term Note in the principal amount of up to $1,500,000 and a ten-year warrant, or the SBCC Warrant, to purchase shares of the most senior capital stock of 1847 Goedeker equal to 5.0% of the outstanding equity securities of 1847 Goedeker on a fully-diluted basis for an aggregate price equal to $100. 
 
The Term Note matures on April 5, 2023 and bears interest at the sum of the Cash Interest Rate (defined as 11% per annum) plus the PIK Interest Rate (defined as 2% per annum); provided that upon an Event of Default all principal, past due interest and all fees shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Cash Interest Rate and the PIK Interest Rate, in each case plus 3.00%. Interest accrued at the Cash Interest Rate shall be due and payable in arrears on the last day of each month commencing May 31, 2019. Interest accrued at the PIK Interest Rate shall be automatically capitalized, compounded and added to the principal amount of the Term Note on each last day of each quarter unless paid in cash on or prior to the last day of each quarter; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to an Event of Default shall be payable on demand, and (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid (including interest accrued at the PIK Interest Rate and not yet added to the principal amount of Term Note) shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all interest on Term Note, whether accrued at the Cash Interest Rate or the PIK Interest Rate, shall be due and payable in cash on the maturity date unless payment is sooner required by the Term Loan Agreement.
 
1847 Goedeker must repay to SBCC on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the last business day of June 2019, an aggregate principal amount of the Term Note equal to $93,750, regardless of any prepayments made, and must pay the unpaid principal on the maturity date unless payment is sooner required by the Term Loan Agreement.
 


15

 
1847 Goedeker may prepay the Term Note in whole or in part from time to time; provided that if such prepayment occurs (i) prior to the first anniversary of the closing date, 1847 Goedeker shall pay SBCC an amount equal to 5.0% of such prepayment, (ii) prior to the second anniversary of the closing date and on or after the first anniversary of the closing date, 1847 Goedeker shall pay SBCC an amount equal to 3.0% of such prepayment, or (iii) prior to the third anniversary of the closing date and on or after the second anniversary of the closing date, 1847 Goedeker shall pay SBCC an amount equal to 1.0% of such prepayment, in each case as liquidated damages for damages for loss of bargain to SBCC. In addition, in the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) are received by or on behalf of 1847 Goedeker or 1847 Holdco in respect of any Prepayment Event (as defined above) following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, 1847 Goedeker shall, immediately after such Net Proceeds are received, prepay the Term Note below in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds. 
 
Under the Term Loan Agreement, 1847 Goedeker was required at closing to pay an origination fee of $30,000 to SBCC. Also, as described above, GVC Financial Services, LLC was paid a fee of $150,000 in connection with services it provided in connection with the Term Loan and the Revolving Loan.
 
The Term Loan Agreement contains the same Events of Default as the Revolving Loan Agreement, provided that the reference to the Term Loan in the cross-default provision refers instead to the Revolving Loan. 
 
The Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative financial and other covenants for a loan of this type. The Term Note is secured by a second priority security interest (subordinate to the Revolving Loan) in all of the assets of 1847 Goedeker and 1847 Holdco. In connection with such security interest, on April 5, 2019, (i) 1847 Holdco entered into a Pledge Agreement with SBCC, pursuant to which 1847 Holdco pledged the shares of 1847 Goedeker held by it to SBCC, and (ii) 1847 Goedeker entered Deposit Account Control Agreement with Burnley, SBCC and Montgomery Bank relating to the security interest in 1847 Goedeker’s bank accounts. 
 
In addition, on April 5, 2019, our company entered into a Guaranty with SBCC to guaranty the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement upon the occurrence of certain prohibited acts described in the Guaranty.
 
Equity-Linked Financing
 
On April 5, 2019, our company, 1847 Holdco and 1847 Goedeker (collectively referred to for purposes of this section as 1847) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, or the Leonite Purchase Agreement, with Leonite Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or Leonite, pursuant to which 1847 issued to Leonite a secured convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $714,285.71, or the Leonite Note. As additional consideration for the purchase of the Leonite Note, (i) we issued to Leonite 50,000 common shares, (ii) we issued to Leonite a five-year warrant to purchase 200,000 common shares at an exercise price of $1.25 per share (subject to adjustment), which may be exercised on a cashless basis, or the Leonite Warrant, and (iii) 1847 Holdco issued to Leonite shares of common stock equal to a 7.5% non-dilutable interest in 1847 Holdco. 
 
The Leonite Note carries an original issue discount of $64,285.71 to cover Leonite’s legal fees, accounting fees, due diligence fees and/or other transactional costs incurred in connection with the purchase of the Leonite Note. Therefore, the purchase price of the Leonite Note was $650,000.
 
The Leonite Note bears interest at the rate of the greater of (i) 12% per annum and (ii) the prime rate as set forth in the Wall Street Journal on April 5, 2019 plus 6.5% guaranteed over the holding period on the unconverted principal amount, on the terms set forth in the Leonite Note (referred to as the Stated Rate). Any amount of principal or interest on the Leonite Note, which is not paid by the maturity date, shall bear interest at the rate at the lesser of 24% per annum or the maximum legal amount permitted by law (referred to as the Default Interest). 
 
Beginning on May 5, 2019 and on the same day of each and every calendar month thereafter throughout the term of the Leonite Note, 1847 shall make monthly payments of interest only due under the Leonite Note to Leonite at the Stated Rate as set forth above. 1847 shall pay to Leonite on an accelerated basis any outstanding principal amount of the Leonite Note, along with accrued, but unpaid interest, from: (i) net proceeds of any future financings by our company, but not its subsidiaries, whether debt or equity, or any other financing proceeds, except any transaction having a specific use of proceeds requirement that such proceeds are to be used exclusively to purchase the assets or equity of an unaffiliated business and the proceeds are used accordingly; (ii) net proceeds from any sale of assets of 1847 or any of its subsidiaries other than sales of assets in the ordinary course of business or receipt by 1847 or any of its subsidiaries of any tax credits, subject to rights of Goedeker, or other financing sources of 1847 (including its subsidiaries) existing prior to the date of the Leonite Note; and (iii) net proceeds from the sale of any assets outside of the ordinary course of business or securities in any subsidiary.
 


16

 
The Leonite Note will mature 12 months from the issue date, or April 5, 2020, at which time the principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and other fees relating to the Leonite Note, will be due and payable. Unless an event of default as set forth in the Leonite Note has occurred, 1847 has the right to prepay principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, the Leonite Note at any time prior to the maturity date at 115% of the principal amount, or the Premium, provided, however, that if the prepayment is the result of any of the occurrence of any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above then such prepayment shall be the unpaid principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due but without the Premium.
 
The Leonite Note contains customary events of default, including in the event of (i) non-payment, (ii) a breach by 1847 of its covenants under the Leonite Purchase Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with the Leonite Purchase Agreement, or a breach of any of representations or warranties under the Leonite Note, or (iii) the bankruptcy of 1847. The Leonite Note also contains a cross default provision, whereby a default by 1847 of any covenant or other term or condition contained in any of the other financial instrument issued by 1847 to Leonite or any other third party after the passage of all applicable notice and cure or grace periods that results in a material adverse effect shall, at Leonite’s option, be considered a default under the Leonite Note, in which event Leonite shall be entitled to apply all rights and remedies under the terms of the Leonite Note.
 
Under the Leonite Note, Leonite has the right at any time at its option to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the Leonite Note into fully paid and non-assessable common shares or any shares of capital stock or other securities of our company into which such common shares may be changed or reclassified. The number of common shares to be issued upon each conversion of the Leonite Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount by the applicable conversion price then in effect. The term Conversion Amount means, with respect to any conversion of the Leonite Note, the sum of: (i) the principal amount of the Leonite Note to be converted plus (ii) at Leonite’s option, accrued and unpaid interest, plus (iii) at Leonite’s option, Default Interest, if any, plus (iv) Leonite’s expenses relating to a conversion, plus (v) at Leonite’s option, any amounts owed to Leonite. The conversion price shall be $1.00 per share (referred to as the Fixed Conversion Price) (subject to adjustment as further described in the Leonite Note for common share distributions and splits, certain fundamental transactions, and anti-dilution adjustments), provided that at any time after any event of default under the Leonite Note, the conversion price shall immediately be equal to the lesser of (i) the Fixed Conversion Price less 40%; and (ii) the lowest weighted average price of the common shares during the 21 consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the trading day that 1847 receives a notice of conversion or (iii) the discount to market based on subsequent financings with other investors.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Leonite be entitled to convert any portion of the Leonite Note in excess of that portion of the Leonite Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of common shares beneficially owned by Leonite and its affiliates (other than common shares which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Leonite Note or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of our company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained in the Leonite Note, and, if applicable, net of any shares that may be deemed to be owned by any person not affiliated with Leonite who has purchased a portion of the Leonite Note from Leonite) and (2) the number of common shares issuable upon the conversion of the portion of the Leonite Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by Leonite and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding common shares of our company. Such limitations on conversion may be waived (up to a maximum of 9.99%) by Leonite upon, at its election, not less than 61 days’ prior notice to us, and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by Leonite, as may be specified in such notice of waiver).
 
The Leonite Warrant also contains an ownership limitation. We shall not effect any exercise of the Leonite Warrant, and Leonite shall not have the right to exercise any portion of the Leonite Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to issuance of common shares upon exercise the Leonite Warrant, Leonite, together with its affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with Leonite or any of its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of common shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common shares issuable upon exercise of the Leonite Warrant. Upon no fewer than 61 days’ prior notice to us, Leonite may increase or decrease such beneficial ownership limitation provisions and any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to us. 
 
The Leonite Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. In addition, pursuant to the Leonite Purchase Agreement, Leonite was granted piggy-back registration rights with respect to the common shares, the Leonite Warrant and the shares issuable upon exercise of the Leonite Warrant. Also, in the event that we propose to offer and sell our securities in an Equity Financing (as defined in the Leonite Purchase Agreement), Leonite shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the purchase of the securities being offered in such Equity Financing up to an amount equal to the principal amount of the Leonite Note until the earliest of (i) the maturity date, (ii) the date that the Leonite Note and all accrued but unpaid interest shall have been repaid in full, and (iii) the closing date of an Equity Financing in which all, or any remaining portion, of the outstanding principal amount of the Leonite Note along with accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall have been converted, in full, into, and on the same terms as, the securities being offered in such Equity Financing. 
 


17

 
In addition, as long as Leonite owns at least five percent (5%) of the securities originally purchased under the Leonite Purchase Agreement, we must timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed us pursuant to the Exchange Act or make publicly available in accordance with Rule 144(c) such information as is required for Leonite to sell the securities under Rule 144. If we fail to remain current in our reporting obligations or to provide currently publicly available information in accordance with Rule 144(c) and such failure extends for a period of more than fifteen trading days (the date which such five trading day-period is exceeded, being referred to as the Event Date), then in addition to any other rights Leonite may have under the Leonite Purchase Agreement or under applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly anniversary of each such Event Date until the information failure is cured, we shall pay to Leonite an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 0.75% of purchase price paid for the securities held by Leonite at the Event Date with a maximum amount of liquidated damages payable being capped at $150,000. 
 
Concurrently with 1847 and Leonite entering into the Leonite Purchase Agreement and as security for 1847’s obligations thereunder, on April 5, 2019, our company, 1847 Holdco and 1847 Goedeker entered into a Security and Pledge Agreement with Leonite, or the Security Agreement. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, and in order to secure 1847’s timely payment of the Leonite Note and related obligations and the timely performance of each and all of its covenants and obligations under the Leonite Purchase Agreement and related documents, 1847 unconditionally and irrevocably granted, pledged and hypothecated to Leonite a continuing security interest in and to, a lien upon, assignment of, and right of set-off against, all presently existing and hereafter acquired or arising assets. Such security interest is a first priority security interest with respect to the securities that we own in 1847 Holdco and in 1847 Neese, and a third priority security interest with respect to all other assets. 
 
The rights of Leonite to receive payments under the Leonite Note are subordinate to the rights of Burnley and SBCC under separate Subordination Agreements that Leonite entered into with them on April 5, 2019. 
 
Signing of Cornerstone Transaction
 
On November 12, 2018, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary 1847 CB, Inc., or 1847 CB, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Cornerstone Builders of SW Florida, Inc., a Florida corporation, or Cornerstone, and Anthony Leopardi, or the Seller, pursuant to which 1847 CB agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cornerstone. The original purchase price was $18 million in cash, subject to adjustment. On March 13, 2019, the parties amended the Stock Purchase Agreement to, among other things, revise the purchase price. 
 
Cornerstone has been in business since 1988. It has earned a reputation as one of the leading builders of custom kitchen cabinets, bathroom cabinets, countertops, bathroom remodeling and full home remodeling. Cornerstone’s commitment of excellence has allowed it to service more than 20,000 satisfied customers. With over 200 employees, Cornerstone is a one-stop-shop. In addition to laborers and installers, it employs its own licensed contractors for electric, plumbing, cabinet & countertop installers, shower door installers, carpenters, drywall installers, painters, tile and more. Cornerstone has (3) showrooms located in Ft Myers, Naples and Marco Island.
 
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended (referred to as the Cornerstone Purchase Agreement), the purchase is $15,000,000 consisting of: (i) $7,425,000 in cash, subject to adjustment; (ii) a subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $3,338,359; and (iii) a subordinated contingent promissory note in the aggregate amount of $4,236,641. The purchase price assumes that 1847 CB will be able to verify through its accounting due diligence that Cornerstone is trending to achieve at least $3,673,000 of EBITDA on an adjusted basis as mutually agreed upon between the 1847 CB and the Seller.
 
The purchase price is subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment provision. Under this provision, on or before the 75th day following the closing of the acquisition, the purchase price will be adjusted upward if the audited balance sheet of Cornerstone as of the closing date, or the Final Balance Sheet, indicates working capital that is higher than that shown on the unaudited preliminary balance sheet as of the same date that was prepared by Cornerstone, or the Preliminary Balance Sheet. The amount of the adjustment would be equal to the difference in working capital amounts. Similarly, if the working capital as shown on the Final Balance Sheet is less than that shown on the Preliminary Balance Sheet, a downward adjustment to the purchase price will be made in the amount of the difference.
 


18

 
In addition to the post-closing working capital adjustment described above, there is a minimum working capital adjustment. “Minimum Working Capital” is defined in the agreement as $300,000. At the closing, if the Minimum Working Capital of Cornerstone exceeds the working capital indicated on the Preliminary Balance Sheet, or the Preliminary Working Capital, then the purchase price will be reduced at the closing by the amount of such difference. Similarly, if the Preliminary Working Capital exceeds the Minimum Working Capital, then the purchase price will be increased by the difference and all cash or cash equivalents shall be disbursed to the Seller that are in excess of the Minimum Working Capital Amount.
 
The purchase price will also be reduced by the amount of outstanding indebtedness of Cornerstone existing as of the closing date and the deducted amount will be used to pay off any such indebtedness.
 
As noted above, a portion of the purchase price will be paid by the issuance by 1847 CB to the Seller of a subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of $3,338,359. This note will accrue interest at 8% per annum and will mature on the third anniversary of the closing date, at which time the principal along with any accrued but unpaid interest will be paid in one lump sum. This note will contain customary events of default. The rights of the Seller to receive payments under this note will be subordinate in right to the senior indebtedness of 1847 CB up to a maximum of $7,500,000.
 
As noted above, a portion of the purchase price will be paid by the issuance by 1847 CB to the Seller of a contingent subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of $4,236,641. This note will accrue interest at 8% per annum. This note will be payable only if Cornerstone achieves a minimum average of $3,673,000 of adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, at which time $1,467,731 of the principal, plus accrued but unpaid interest will become immediately due and payable, provided however, that if the actual average adjusted EBITDA for this period exceeds the minimum average adjusted EBITDA, up to a maximum average adjusted EBITDA of $5,509,500, then the amount due and payable under this note will be increased proportionately, up to the full principal, plus accrued but unpaid interest. This note will contain customary events of default. The rights of the Seller to receive payments under this note will be subordinate in right to the senior indebtedness of 1847 CB up to a maximum of $7,500,000.
 
The Cornerstone Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a covenant that the Seller will not complete with the business of Cornerstone for a period of three (3) years following closing.
 
The Cornerstone Purchase Agreement also contains mutual indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties and failure to perform covenants or obligations contained in the Cornerstone Purchase Agreement. In the case of the indemnification provided by the Seller with respect to breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties, the Seller will only become liable for indemnified losses if the amount exceeds $100,000. Furthermore, the liability of the Seller for breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties shall not exceed the cash portion of the purchase price payable under the Cornerstone Purchase Agreement. 
 
The closing of the Cornerstone Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the completion of accounting and legal due diligence investigations; the receipt of all authorizations, consents and approvals of all governmental authorities or agencies; the receipt of any required consents of any third parties; the release of any security interests; 1847 CB obtaining the requisite acquisition financing; and delivery of all opinions and documents required for the transfer of shares of Cornerstone to 1847 CB. 
 
In addition, the closing is conditioned on affiliates of the Seller transferring title to all real estate that is used in the Cornerstone business to 1847 CB without additional cost.
 
The Cornerstone Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to closing by (i) mutual agreement of the parties; (ii) by either 1847 CB or the Seller if any governmental entity has issued an order or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Cornerstone Purchase Agreement; (iii) by either 1847 CB or the Seller if the closing does not occur on or before April 15, 2019; provided that the right to terminate will not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of the Cornerstone Purchase Agreement results in the failure of the closing to occur by such time; (iv) by 1847 CB if the Seller or Cornerstone has breached their respective representations and warranties or any covenant or other agreement to be performed by it in a manner such that the closing conditions to be performed by it would not be satisfied; or (v) by the Seller if 1847 CB has breached its representations and warranties or any covenant or other agreement to be performed by it in a manner such that the closing conditions to be performed by it would not be satisfied.

OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND HISTORY
 
Our company is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on January 22, 2013. Your rights as a holder of common shares, and the fiduciary duties of our board of directors and executive officers, and any limitations relating thereto, are set forth in the operating agreement governing our company and may differ from those applying to a Delaware corporation. However, subject to certain exceptions, the documents governing our company specify that the duties of our directors and officers will be generally consistent with the duties of directors and officers of a Delaware corporation. 
 
Our company will be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the partnership income tax provisions, our company will not incur any U.S. federal income tax liability; rather, each of our shareholders will be required to take into account his or her allocable share of company income, gain, loss, and deduction. As a holder of common shares, you may not receive cash distributions sufficient in amount to cover taxes in respect of your allocable share of our company’s net taxable income. Our company will file a partnership return with the IRS and will issue tax information, including a Schedule K-1, to you that describes your allocable share of our company’s income, gain, loss, deduction, and other items. The U.S. federal income tax rules that apply to partnerships are complex, and complying with the reporting requirements may require significant time and expense. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” included in the registration statement for more information. 
 
Our company has two classes of limited liability company interests - the common shares and the allocation shares, all of which have been and will continue to be held by our manager. See “Description of Securities” included in the registration statement for more information about the common shares and the allocation shares. 
 
On March 3, 2017, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary 1847 Neese acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Neese for an aggregate purchase price of $6,655,000, consisting of: (i) $2,225,000 in cash (subject to certain adjustments); (ii) 450 shares of the common stock of 1847 Neese, valued by the parties at $1,530,000, constituting 45% of its capital stock; (iii) the issuance of a vesting promissory note in the principal amount of $1,875,000 (which was determined to have a fair value of $395,634) due June 30, 2020; and (iv) the issuance of a short-term promissory note in the principal amount of $1,025,000 due March 3, 2018. 1847 Neese was formed in the State of Delaware on October 11, 2016 and Neese was formed in the State of Iowa in January 1993.
 
On January 10, 2019, in anticipation of signing of the Goedeker Purchase Agreement, we formed 1847 Goedeker as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Delaware. On March 20, 2019, we formed 1847 Holdco as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Delaware. On March 22, 2019, we transferred all of our shares in 1847 Goedeker to 1847 Holdco.
 
On November 9, 2018, in anticipation of signing of the Cornerstone Purchase Agreement, we formed 1847 CB as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Delaware.

The following chart depicts our current organizational structure.
 


See “—Our Manager” for more details regarding the ownership of our manager.
 
OUR MANAGER
 
Overview of Our Manager 
 
Our manager, 1847 Partners LLC, is a Delaware limited liability company. It has two classes of limited liability interests known as Class A interests and Class B interests. The Class A interests, which give the holder the right to the profit allocation received by our manager as a result of holding our allocation shares, are owned in their entirety by 1847 Partners Class A Member LLC; and the Class B interests, which give the holder the right to all other profits or losses of our manager, including the management fee payable to our manager by us, are owned in their entirety by 1847 Partners Class B Member LLC. 1847 Partners Class A Member LLC is owned 52% by Ellery W. Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, and 38% by 1847 Founders Capital LLC, which is owned by Edward J. Tobin. 1847 Partners Class B Member LLC is owned 54% by Ellery W. Roberts and 36% by 1847 Founders Capital LLC. Mr. Roberts is also the sole manager of both entities. In the future, Mr. Roberts may cause 1847 Partners Class A Member LLC or 1847 Partners Class B Member LLC to issue units to employees of our manager to incentivize those employees by providing them with the ability to participate in our manager’s incentive allocation and management fee. 
Key Personnel of Our Manager
 
The key personnel of our manager are Ellery W. Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, and Edward J. Tobin. Please see “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for a description of the business experience of these individuals. Each of these individuals will be compensated entirely by our manager from the management fees it receives. As employees of our manager, these individuals devote a substantial majority of their time to the affairs of our company. 
 
Collectively, the management team of our manager has more than 60 years of combined experience in acquiring and managing small businesses and has overseen the acquisitions and financing of over 50 businesses.
 


21

Acquisition and Disposition Opportunities
 
Our manager has exclusive responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to acquisition and disposition opportunities. If our manager does not originate an opportunity, our board of directors will seek a recommendation from our manager prior to making a decision concerning such opportunity. In the case of any acquisition or disposition opportunity that involves an affiliate of our manager or us, our nominating and corporate governance committee, or, if we do not have such a committee, the independent members of our board of directors, will be required to authorize and approve such transaction.
 
Our manager will review each acquisition or disposition opportunity presented to our manager to determine if such opportunity satisfies the acquisition and disposition criteria established by our board of directors. The acquisition and disposition criteria provide that our manager will review each acquisition opportunity presented to it to determine if such opportunity satisfies our company’s acquisition and disposition criteria, and if it is determined, in our manager’s sole discretion, that an opportunity satisfies the criteria, our manager will refer the opportunity to our board of directors for its authorization and approval prior to the consummation of any such opportunity.
 
Our investment criteria include the following:
 


· | Revenue of at least $5.0 million 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Current year EBITDA/Pre-tax Income of at least $1.5 million with a history of positive cash flow 
· | Clearly identifiable “blueprint” for growth with the potential for break-out returns 
· | Well-positioned companies within our core industry categories (consumer-driven, business-to-business, light manufacturing and specialty finance) with strong returns on capital
· | Opportunities wherein building management team, infrastructure and access to capital are the primary drivers of creating value 
· | Headquartered in North America 

 
We believe we will be able to acquire small businesses for multiples ranging from three to six times EBITDA. With respect to investment opportunities that do not fall within the criteria set forth above our manager must first present such opportunities to our board of directors. Our board of directors and our manager will review these criteria from time to time and our board of directors may make changes and modifications to such criteria as our company makes additional acquisitions and dispositions. 
 
If an acquisition opportunity is referred to our board of directors by our manager and our board of directors determines not to timely pursue such opportunity in whole or in part, any part of such opportunity that our company does not promptly pursue may be pursued by our manager or may be referred by our manager to any person, including affiliates of our manager. In this case, our manager is likely to devote a portion of its time to the oversight of this opportunity, including the management of a business that we do not own.
 
If there is a disposition, our manager must use its commercially reasonable efforts to manage a process through which the value of such disposition can be maximized, taking into consideration non-financial factors such as those relating to competition, strategic partnerships, potential favorable or adverse effects on us, our businesses, or our investments or any similar factors that may reasonably perceived as having a short- or long-term impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Management Services Agreement
 
The management services agreement sets forth the services to be performed by our manager. Our manager will perform such services subject to the oversight and supervision of our board of directors.

22

 
In general, our manager will perform those services for our company that would be typically performed by the executive officers of a company. Specifically, our manager will perform the following services, which we refer to as the management services, pursuant to the management services agreement:
 


· | manage the day-to-day business and operations of our company, including our liquidity and capital resources and compliance with applicable law; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | identify, evaluate, manage, perform due diligence on, negotiate and oversee acquisitions of target businesses and any other investments; 
· | evaluate and oversee the financial and operational performance of our businesses, including monitoring the business and operations of such businesses, and the financial performance of any other investments that we make;
· | provide, on our behalf, managerial assistance to our businesses; 
· | evaluate, manage, negotiate and oversee dispositions of all or any part of any of our property, assets or investments, including disposition of all or any part of our businesses; 
· | provide or second, as necessary, employees of our manager to serve as executive officers or other employees of our company or as members of our board of directors; and 
· | perform any other services that would be customarily performed by executive officers and employees of a publicly listed or quoted company. 

 
Our company and our manager have the right at any time during the term of the management services agreement to change the services provided by our manager. In performing management services, our manager will have all necessary power and authority to perform, or cause to be performed, such services on behalf of our company, and, in this respect, our manager will be the only provider of management services to our company. Nonetheless, our manager will be required to obtain authorization and approval of our board of directors in all circumstances where executive officers of a corporation typically would be required to obtain authorization and approval of a corporation’s board of directors, including, for example, with respect to the consummation of an acquisition of a target business, the issuance of securities or the entry into credit arrangements.
 
While our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ellery W. Roberts, intends to devote substantially all of his time to the affairs of our company, neither Mr. Roberts, nor our manager, is expressly prohibited from investing in or managing other entities. In this regard, the management services agreement will not require our manager and its affiliates to provide management services to our company exclusively.
 
Secondment of Our Executive Officers
 
In accordance with the terms of the management services agreement, our manager may second to our company our executive officers, which means that these individuals will be assigned by our manager to work for us during the term of the management services agreement. Our board of directors has appointed Mr. Roberts as an executive officer of our company. Although Mr. Roberts is an employee of our manager, he will report directly, and be subject, to our board of directors. In this respect, our board of directors may, after due consultation with our manager, at any time request that our manager replace any individual seconded to our company and our manager will, as promptly as practicable, replace any such individual; however, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Roberts, controls our manager, which may make it difficult for our board of directors to completely sever ties with Mr. Roberts. Our manager and our board of directors may agree from time to time that our manager will second to our company one or more additional individuals to serve on behalf of our company, upon such terms as our manager and our board of directors may mutually agree.
 
Indemnification by our Company
 
Our company has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless our manager and its employees and representatives, including any individuals seconded to our company, from and against all losses, claims and liabilities incurred by our manager in connection with, relating to or arising out of the performance of any management services. However, our company will not be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless our manager for any losses, claims and liabilities incurred by our manager in connection with, relating to or arising out of (i) a breach by our manager or its employees or its representatives of the management services agreement, (ii) the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of our manager or its employees or representatives in the performance of any of its obligations under the management services agreement, or (iii) fraudulent or dishonest acts of our manager or its employees or representatives with respect to our company or any of its businesses.
 
We expect that our directors and officers insurance policy for our directors and officers will be expanded, or supplemental insurance will be obtained, to cover this indemnification obligation.
 


23

Termination of Management Services Agreement
 
Our board of directors may terminate the management services agreement and our manager’s appointment if, at any time:
 


· | a majority of our board of directors vote to terminate the management services agreement, and the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares (other than shares beneficially owned by our manager) then entitled to vote also vote to terminate the management services agreement; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | neither Mr. Roberts nor his designated successor controls our manager, which change of control occurs without the prior written consent of our board of directors; 
· | there is a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable order that (i) our manager materially breached the terms of the management services agreement and such breach continued unremedied for 60 days after our manager receives written notice from our company setting forth the terms of such breach, or (ii) our manager (x) acted with gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard in performing its duties and obligations under the management services agreement, or (y) engaged in fraudulent or dishonest acts in connection with the business or operations of our company;
· | our manager has been convicted of a felony under federal or state law, our board of directors finds that our manager is demonstrably and materially incapable of performing its duties and obligations under the management services agreement, and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares, other than shares beneficially owned by our manager, vote to terminate the management services agreement; or 
· | there is a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that our manager has (i) engaged in fraudulent or dishonest acts in connection with the business or operations of our company or (ii) acted with gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard in performing its duties and obligations under the management services agreement, and the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares (other than shares beneficially owned by our manager) vote to terminate the management services agreement. 

 
In addition, our manager may resign and terminate the management services agreement at any time upon 120 days prior written notice to our company, and this right is not contingent upon the finding of a replacement manager. However, if our manager resigns, until the date on which the resignation becomes effective, it will, upon request of our board of directors, use reasonable efforts to assist our board of directors to find a replacement manager at no cost and expense to our company.
 
Upon the termination of the management services agreement, seconded officers, employees, representatives and delegates of our manager and its affiliates who are performing the services that are the subject of the management services agreement will resign their respective position with our company and cease to work at the date of such termination or at any other time as determined by our manager. Any director appointed by our manager may continue serving on our board of directors subject to the terms of the operating agreement.
 
If we terminate the management services agreement, our company and its businesses have agreed to cease using the term “1847”, including any trademarks based on the name of our company that may be licensed to them by our manager, under the licensing provisions of the management services agreement, entirely in their businesses and operations within 180 days of such termination. Such licensing provisions of the management services agreement would require our company and its businesses to change their names to remove any reference to the term “1847” or any reference to trademarks licensed to them by our manager. In this respect, our right to use the term “1847” and related intellectual property is subject to licensing provisions between our manager, on the one hand, and our company and our businesses, on the other hand.
 
Except with respect to the termination fee payable to our manager due to a termination of the management services agreement based solely on a vote of our board of directors and our shareholders, no other termination fee is payable upon termination of the management services agreement for any other reason. See “Our Manager—Our Manager as a Service Provider—Termination Fee” for more information about the termination fee payable upon termination of the management services agreement.
 
While termination of the management services agreement will not affect any terms and conditions, including those relating to any payment obligations, that exist under any offsetting management services agreements or transaction services agreements, such agreements will be terminable by future businesses that we acquire upon 60 days prior written notice and there will be no termination or other similar fees due upon such termination. Notwithstanding termination of the management services agreement, our manager will maintain its rights with respect to the allocation shares it then owns, including its rights under the supplemental put provision of our operating agreement. See “—Our Manager—Our Manager as an Equity Holder—Supplemental Put Provision” for more information on our manager’s put right with respect to the allocation shares.
 


24

Our Relationship with Our Manager, Manager Fees and Manager Profit Allocation
 
Our relationship with our manager is based on our manager having two distinct roles: first, as a service provider to us and, second, as an equity holder of the allocation shares.
 
As a service provider, our manager performs a variety of services for us, which entitles it to receive a management fee. As holder of our company’s allocation shares, our manager has the right to a preferred distribution in the form of a profit allocation upon the occurrence of certain events. Our manager paid $1,000 for the allocation shares. In addition, our manager will have the right to cause our company to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement. 
 
These relationships with our manager are governed principally by the following agreements: 
 


· | · the management services agreements relating to the services our manager will perform for us and our businesses; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | · our company’s operating agreement relating to our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares it owns and which contains the supplemental put provision relating to our manager’s right to cause our company to purchase the allocation shares it owns.

 
We also expect that our manager will enter into offsetting management services agreements and transaction services agreements with our businesses directly. These agreements, and some of the material terms relating thereto, are discussed in more detail below. The management fee, profit allocation and put price under the supplemental put provision will be payment obligations of our company and, as a result, will be paid, along with other company obligations, prior to the payment of monthly distributions to shareholders.
 
The following table provides a simplified description of the fees and profit allocation rights held by our manager. Further detail is provided in the following subsections.
 


Description | Fee Calculation | Payment Term

Determined by Management Services Agreement | 0.5% of adjusted net assets (2.0% annually) | Quarterly

Holding event: at the option of our manager, for the 30 day period following the 5th anniversary of an acquired business (but only based on historical profits of the business) 

Our Manager as a Service Provider
 
Management Fee 
 
Our company will pay our manager a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annualized) of its adjusted net assets, as discussed in more detail below. 
 
Subject to any adjustments discussed below, for performing management services under the management services agreement during any fiscal quarter, our company will pay our manager a management fee with respect to such fiscal quarter. The management fee to be paid with respect to any fiscal quarter will be calculated as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, which we refer to as the calculation date. The management fee will be calculated by an administrator, which will be our manager so long as the management services agreement is in effect. The amount of any management fee payable by our company as of any calculation date with respect to any fiscal quarter will be (i) reduced by the aggregate amount of any offsetting management fees, if any, received by our manager from any of our businesses with respect to such fiscal quarter, (ii) reduced (or increased) by the amount of any over-paid (or under-paid) management fees received by (or owed to) our manager as of such calculation date, and (iii) increased by the amount of any outstanding accrued and unpaid management fees. 
 
As an obligation of our company, the management fee will be paid prior to the payment of monthly distributions to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the management fee when due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to pay the management fee. 
 
Offsetting Management Services Agreements 
 
Pursuant to the management services agreement, we have agreed that our manager may, at any time, enter into offsetting management services agreements with our businesses pursuant to which our manager may perform services that may or may not be similar to management services. Any fees to be paid by one of our businesses pursuant to such agreements are referred to as offsetting management fees and will offset, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the management fee otherwise due and payable by our company under the management services agreement with respect to a fiscal quarter. The management services agreement provides that the aggregate amount of offsetting management fees to be paid to our manager with respect to any fiscal quarter shall not exceed the management fee to be paid to our manager with respect to such fiscal quarter. 
 
Our manager entered into offsetting management services agreements with 1847 Neese and 1847 Goedeker and may enter into offsetting management services agreements with our future subsidiaries, which agreements would be in the form prescribed by our management services agreement.
 


26

 
The services that our manager will provide to future subsidiaries under the offsetting management services agreements will include: conducting general and administrative supervision and oversight of the subsidiary’s day-to-day business and operations, including, but not limited to, recruiting and hiring of personnel, administration of personnel and personnel benefits, development of administrative policies and procedures, establishment and management of banking services, managing and arranging for the maintaining of liability insurance, arranging for equipment rental, maintenance of all necessary permits and licenses, acquisition of any additional licenses and permits that become necessary, participation in risk management policies and procedures; and overseeing and consulting with respect to our business and operational strategies, the implementation of such strategies and the evaluation of such strategies, including, but not limited to, strategies with respect to capital expenditure and expansion programs, acquisitions or dispositions and product or service lines. If our manager and the subsidiary do not enter into an offsetting management services agreement, our manager will provide these services for our subsidiaries under our management services agreement. 
 
The offsetting management fee paid to our manager for providing management services to a future subsidiary will vary. 
 
On March 3, 2017, 1847 Neese entered into an offsetting management services agreement with our manager and on April 5, 2019, 1847 Goedeker entered into an offsetting management services agreement with our manager. Pursuant to the offsetting management services agreements, each of 1847 Neese and 1847 Goedeker appointed our manager to provide certain services to it for a quarterly management fee equal to $62,500 per quarter (in the case of 1847 Goedeker, such fee is equal to the greater of $62,500 or 2% of Adjusted Net Assets (as defined in the management services agreement)); provided, however, that (i) pro rated payments shall be made in the first quarter and the last quarter of the term, (ii) if the aggregate amount of management fees paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese or 1847 Goedeker, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of our company to our manager, in each case, with respect to any fiscal year exceeds, or is expected to exceed, 9.5% of our gross income with respect to such fiscal year, then the management fee to be paid by 1847 Neese or 1847 Goedeker for any remaining fiscal quarters in such fiscal year shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis determined by reference to the management fees to be paid to our manager by all of the subsidiaries of our company, until the aggregate amount of the management fee paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese or 1847 Goedeker, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of our company to our manager, in each case, with respect to such fiscal year, does not exceed 9.5% of our gross income with respect to such fiscal year, and (iii) if the aggregate amount the management fee paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese or 1847 Goedeker, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of our company to our manager, in each case, with respect to any fiscal quarter exceeds, or is expected to exceed, the aggregate amount of the management fee (before any adjustment thereto) calculated and payable under the management services agreement, which we refer to as the parent management fee, with respect to such fiscal quarter, then the management fee to be paid by 1847 Neese or 1847 Goedeker for such fiscal quarter shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis, until the aggregate amount of the management fee paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese 1847 Goedeker, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of our company to our manager, in each case, with respect to such fiscal quarter, does not exceed the parent management fee calculated and payable with respect to such fiscal quarter. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of the management fee to 1847 Goedeker is subordinated to the payment of interest on the Goedeker Note, such that no payment of the management fee may be made if 1847 Goedeker is in default under the Goedeker Note with regard to interest payments and, for the avoidance of doubt, such payment of the management fee will be contingent on 1847 Goedeker being in good standing on all associated loan covenants. In addition, during the period that that any amounts are owed under the Goedeker Note or the Earn Out Payments, the annual management fee shall be capped at $250,000. 
 
In addition, the rights of our manager to receive payments under the 1847 Goedeker offsetting management services agreement are subordinate to the rights of Burnley and SBCC under separate subordination agreements that our entered into with them on April 5, 2019. 
 
Each of 1847 Neese and 1847 Goedeker shall also reimburse our manager for all of its costs and expenses which are specifically approved by its board of directors, including all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, which are actually incurred by our manager or its affiliates on behalf of 1847 Neese or 1847 Goedeker in connection with performing services under the offsetting management services agreements. 
 
The services provided by our manager include: conducting general and administrative supervision and oversight of day-to-day business and operations, including, but not limited to, recruiting and hiring of personnel, administration of personnel and personnel benefits, development of administrative policies and procedures, establishment and management of banking services, managing and arranging for the maintaining of liability insurance, arranging for equipment rental, maintenance of all necessary permits and licenses, acquisition of any additional licenses and permits that become necessary, participation in risk management policies and procedures; and overseeing and consulting with respect to business and operational strategies, the implementation of such strategies and the evaluation of such strategies, including, but not limited to, strategies with respect to capital expenditure and expansion programs, acquisitions or dispositions and product or service lines.

Example of Calculation of Management Fee with Adjustment for Offsetting Management Fees
 
In order to better understand how the management fee is calculated, we are providing the following example: 
 

Quarterly management fee: | | (in thousands) | 
----------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+--------
1 | Consolidated total assets | $ | 100,000 | 
2 | Consolidated accumulation amortization of intangibles | | 5,000 | 
3 | Total cash and cash equivalents | | 5,000 | 
4 | Adjusted total liabilities | | (10,000 | )
5 | Adjusted net assets (Line 1 + Line 2 – Line 3 – Line 4) | | 90,000 | 
6 | Multiplied by quarterly rate | | 0.5 | %
7 | Quarterly management fee | $ | 450 | 
Offsetting management fees: | | 
8 | Acquired company A offsetting management fees | $ | (100 | )
9 | Acquired company B offsetting management fees | | (100 | )
10 | Acquired company C offsetting management fees | | (100 | )
11 | Acquired company D offsetting management fees | | (100 | )
12 | Total offsetting management fees (Line 8 + Line 9 – Line 10 – Line 11) | | (400 | )
13 | Quarterly management fee payable by Company (Line 7 + Line 12) | $ | 50 | 

 
The foregoing example provides hypothetical information only and does not intend to reflect actual or expected management fee amounts.
 
For purposes of the calculation of the management fee:

Transaction Services Agreements 
 
Pursuant to the management services agreement, we have agreed that our manager may, at any time, enter into transaction services agreements with any of our businesses relating to the performance by our manager of certain transaction-related services in connection with the acquisitions of target businesses by our company or its businesses or dispositions of our company’s or its businesses’ property or assets. These services may include those customarily performed by a third-party investment banking firm or similar financial advisor, which may or may not be similar to management services, in connection with the acquisition of target businesses by us or our subsidiaries or disposition of subsidiaries or any of our property or assets or those of our subsidiaries. In connection with providing transaction services, our manager will generally receive a fee equal to the sum of (i) 2.0% of the aggregate purchase price of the target business up to and equal to $50 million, plus (ii) 1.5% of the aggregate purchase price of the target business in excess of $50 million and up to and equal to $100 million, plus (iii) 1.0% of the aggregate purchase price over $100 million, subject to annual review by our board of directors. The purchase price of a target business shall be defined as the aggregate amount of consideration, including cash and the value of any shares issued by us on the date of acquisition, paid for the equity interests of such target business plus the aggregate principal amount of any debt assumed by us of the target business on the date of acquisition or any similar formulation. The other terms and conditions relating to the performance of transaction services will be established in accordance with market practice.
 
Our manager may enter into transaction services agreements with our subsidiaries and future subsidiaries, which agreements would be in the form prescribed by our management services agreement.
 
The services that our manager will provide to our subsidiaries and future subsidiaries under the transaction services agreements will include the following services that would be provided in connection with a specific transaction identified at the time that the transaction services agreement is entered into: reviewing, evaluating and otherwise familiarizing itself and its affiliates with the business, operations, properties, financial condition and prospects of the future subsidiary and its target acquisition and preparing documentation describing the future subsidiary’s operations, management, historical financial results, projected financial results and any other relevant matters and presenting such documentation and making recommendations with respect thereto to certain of our manager’s affiliates.
 
Any fees received by our manager pursuant to such a transaction services agreement will be in addition to the management fee payable by our company pursuant to the management services agreement and will not offset the payment of such management fee. A transaction services agreement with any of our businesses may provide for the reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by our manager in connection with the acquisition of such businesses.
 
Transaction services agreements will be reviewed, authorized and approved by our company’s board of directors on an annual basis. 
 
Reimbursement of Expenses
 
Our company will be responsible for paying costs and expenses relating to its business and operations. Our company agreed to reimburse our manager during the term of the management services agreement for all costs and expenses of our company that are incurred by our manager or its affiliates on behalf of our company, including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services under the management services agreement, and all costs and expenses the reimbursement of which are specifically approved by our company’s board of directors.
 
Our company will not be obligated or responsible for reimbursing or otherwise paying for any costs or expenses relating to our manager’s overhead or any other costs and expenses relating to our manager’s conduct of its business and operations. Also, our company will not be obligated or responsible for reimbursing our manager for costs and expenses incurred by our manager in the identification, evaluation, management, performance of due diligence on, negotiation and oversight of potential acquisitions of new businesses for which our company (or our manager on behalf of our company) fails to submit an indication of interest or letter of intent to pursue such acquisition, including costs and expenses relating to travel, marketing and attendance of industry events and retention of outside service providers relating thereto. In addition, our company will not be obligated or responsible for reimbursing our manager for costs and expenses incurred by our manager in connection with the identification, evaluation, management, performance of due diligence on, negotiating and oversight of an acquisition by our company if such acquisition is actually consummated and the business so acquired entered into a transaction services agreement with our manager providing for the reimbursement of such costs and expenses by such business. In this respect, the costs and expenses associated with the pursuit of add-on acquisitions for our company may be reimbursed by any businesses so acquired pursuant to a transaction services agreement.
 
All reimbursements will be reviewed and, in certain circumstances, approved by our company’s board of directors on an annual basis in connection with the preparation of year-end financial statements.
 


29

Termination Fee 
 
We will pay our manager a termination fee upon termination of the management services agreement if such termination is based solely on a vote of our company’s board of directors and our shareholders; no other termination fee will be payable to our manager in connection with the termination of the management services agreement for any other reason. The termination fee that is payable to our manager will be equal to the product of (i) two (2) multiplied by (ii) the sum of the amount of the quarterly management fees calculated with respect to the four fiscal quarters immediately preceding the termination date of the management services agreement. The termination fee will be payable in eight equal quarterly installments, with the first such installment being paid on or within five business days of the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the management services agreement was terminated and each subsequent installment being paid on or within five business days of the last day of each subsequent fiscal quarter, until such time as the termination fee is paid in full to our manager. 
Our Manager as an Equity Holder
 
Manager’s Profit Allocation 
 
Our manager owns 100% of the allocation shares of our company, which generally will entitle our manager to receive a 20% profit allocation as a form of preferred distribution. Upon the sale of a company subsidiary, our manager will be paid a profit allocation if the sum of (i) the excess of the gain on the sale of such subsidiary over a high water mark plus (ii) the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition by our company exceeds the 8% hurdle rate. The 8% hurdle rate is the product of (i) a 2% rate per quarter, multiplied by (ii) the number of quarters such subsidiary was held by our company, multiplied by (iii) the subsidiary’s average share (determined based on gross assets, generally) of our consolidated net equity (determined according to GAAP with certain adjustments). In certain circumstances, after a subsidiary has been held for at least 5 years, our manager may also trigger a profit allocation with respect to such subsidiary (determined based solely on the subsidiary’s net income since its acquisition). The calculation of the profit allocation and the rights of our manager, as the holder of the allocation shares, are governed by the operating agreement. 
 
Our board will have the opportunity to review and approve the calculation of manager’s profit allocation when it becomes due and payable. Our manager will not receive a profit allocation on an annual basis. Instead, our manager will be paid a profit allocation only upon the occurrence of one of the following events, which we refer to collectively as the trigger events: 
 


· | the sale of a material amount, as determined by our manager and reasonably consented to by a majority of our company’s board of directors, of the capital stock or assets of one of our businesses or a subsidiary of one of our businesses, which event we refer to as a sale event; or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | at the option of our manager, for the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in a business, which event we refer to as a holding event. If our manager elects to forego declaring a holding event with respect to such business during such period, then our manager may only declare a holding event with respect to such business during the 30-day period following each anniversary of such fifth anniversary date with respect to such business. Once declared, our manager may only declare another holding event with respect to a business following the fifth anniversary of the calculation date with respect to a previously declared holding event.

 
We believe this payment timing, rather than a method that provides for annual allocation payments, more accurately reflects the long-term performance of each of our businesses and is consistent with our intent to hold, manage and grow our businesses over the long term. We refer generally to the obligation to make this payment to our manager as the “profit allocation” and, specifically, to the amount of any particular profit allocation as the “manager’s profit allocation.” 
 
Definitions used in, and an example of the calculation of profit allocation, are set forth in more detail below. 
 
The amount of our manager’s profit allocation will be based on the extent to which the “total profit allocation amount” (as defined below) with respect to any business, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter in which a trigger event occurs, which date we refer to as the “calculation date”, exceeds the relevant hurdle amounts (as described below) with respect to such business, as of such calculation date. Our manager’s profit allocation will be calculated by an administrator, which will be our manager so long as the management services agreement is in effect, and such calculation will be subject to a review and approval process by our company’s board of directors. For this purpose, “total profit allocation amount” will be equal to, with respect to any business as of any calculation date, the sum of: 
 


30


· | the contribution-based profit (as described below) of such business as of such calculation date, which will be calculated upon the occurrence of any trigger event with respect to such business; plus 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the excess of the cumulative gains and losses of our company (as described below) over the high water mark (as described below) as of such calculation date, which will only be calculated upon the occurrence of a sale event with respect to such business, and not on a holding event (we generally expect this component to be the most significant component in calculating total profit allocation amount).

 
Specifically, manager’s profit allocation will be calculated and paid as follows: 
 


· | manager’s profit allocation will not be paid with respect to a trigger event relating to any business if the total profit allocation amount, as of any calculation date, with respect to such business does not exceed such business’ level 1 hurdle amount (based on an 8% annualized hurdle rate, as described below), as of such calculation date; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | manager’s profit allocation will be paid with respect to a trigger event relating to any business if the total profit allocation amount, as of any calculation date, with respect to such business exceeds such business’ level 1 hurdle amount, as of such calculation date. Our manager’s profit allocation to be paid with respect to such calculation date will be equal to the sum of the following:


o | 100% of such business’ total profit allocation amount, as of such calculation date, with respect to that portion of the total profit allocation amount that exceeds such business’ level 1 hurdle amount (\but is less than or equal to such business’ level 2 hurdle amount (which is based on a 10% annualized hurdle rate, as described below), in each case, as of such calculation date. We refer to this portion of the total profit allocation amount as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is intended to provide our manager with an overall profit allocation of 20% of the business’ total profit allocation amount until such business’ level 2 hurdle amount has been reached; plus
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | 20% of the total profit allocation amount, as of such calculation date, that exceeds such business’ level 2 hurdle amount as of such calculation date; minus 
o | the high water mark allocation, if any, as of such calculation date. The effect of deducting the high water mark allocation is to take into account profit allocations our manager has already received in respect of past gains attributable to previous sale events. 

 
The administrator will calculate our manager’s profit allocation on or promptly following the relevant calculation date, subject to a “true-up” calculation upon availability of audited or unaudited consolidated financial statements, as the case may be, of our company to the extent not available on such calculation date. Any adjustment necessitated by the true-up calculation will be made in connection with the next calculation of manager’s profit allocation. Because of the length of time that may pass between trigger events, there may be a significant delay in our company’s ability to realize the benefit, if any, of a true-up of our manager’s profit allocation. 
 
Once calculated, the administrator will submit the calculation of our manager’s profit allocation, as adjusted pursuant to any true-up, to our company’s board of directors for its review and approval. The board of directors will have ten business days to review and approve the calculation, which approval shall be automatic absent disapproval by the board of directors. Our manager’s profit allocation will be paid ten business days after such approval.
 
If the board of directors disapproves of the administrator’s calculation of manager’s profit allocation, the calculation and payment of manager’s profit allocation will be subject to a dispute resolution process, which may result in manager’s profit allocation being determined, at our company’s cost and expense, by two independent accounting firms. Any determination by such independent accounting firms will be conclusive and binding on our company and our manager.
 
We will also pay a tax distribution to our manager if our manager is allocated taxable income by our company but does not realize distributions from our company at least equal to the taxes payable by our manager resulting from allocations of taxable income. Any such tax distributions will be paid in a similar manner as profit allocations are paid.
 
For any fiscal quarter in which a trigger event occurs with respect to more than one business, the calculation of our manager’s profit allocation, including the components thereof, will be made with respect to each business in the order in which controlling interests in such businesses were acquired or obtained by our company and the resulting amounts shall be aggregated to determine the total amount of manager’s profit allocation. If controlling interests in two or more businesses were acquired at the same time and such businesses give rise to a calculation of manager’s profit allocation during the same fiscal quarter, then manager’s profit allocation will be further calculated separately for each such business in the order in which such businesses were sold. 
 


31

 
As obligations of our company, profit allocations and tax distributions will be paid prior to the payment of distributions to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the profit allocations or tax distributions when due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to pay such profit allocation. Our manager will have the right to elect to defer the payment of our manager’s profit allocation due on any payment date. Once deferred, our manager may demand payment thereof upon 20 business days’ prior written notice.
 
Termination of the management services agreement, by any means, will not affect our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares that it owns, including its right to receive profit allocations, unless our manager exercises its put right to sell such allocation shares to our company. 
 
Example of Calculation of Manager’s Profit Allocation
 
Our manager will receive a profit allocation at the end of the fiscal quarter in which a trigger event occurs, as follows (all dollar amounts are in millions):

Supplemental Put Provision 
 
In addition to the provisions discussed above, in consideration of our manager’s acquisition of the allocation shares, our operating agreement contains a supplemental put provision pursuant to which our manager will have the right to cause our company to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement. 
 
If the management services agreement is terminated at any time or our manager resigns, then our manager will have the right, but not the obligation, for one year from the date of such termination or resignation, as the case may be, to elect to cause our company to purchase all of the allocation shares then owned by our manager for the put price as of the put exercise date.
 
For purposes of this provision, the “put price” is equal to, as of any exercise date, (i) if we terminate the management services agreement, the sum of two separate, independently made calculations of the aggregate amount of manager’s profit allocation as of such exercise date or (ii) if our manager resigns, the average of two separate, independently made calculations of the aggregate amount of manager’s profit allocation as of such exercise date, in each case, calculated assuming that (x) all of the businesses are sold in an orderly fashion for fair market value as of such exercise date in the order in which the controlling interest in each business was acquired or otherwise obtained by our company, (y) the last day of the fiscal quarter ending immediately prior to such exercise date is the relevant calculation date for purposes of calculating manager’s profit allocation as of such exercise date. Each of the two separate, independently made calculations of our manager’s profit allocation for purposes of calculating the put price will be performed by a different investment bank that is engaged by our company at its cost and expense. The put price will be adjusted to account for a final “true-up” of our manager’s profit allocation.
 
Our manager and our company can mutually agree to permit our company to issue a note in lieu of payment of the put price when due; provided, that if our manager resigns and terminates the management services agreement, then our company will have the right, in its sole discretion, to issue a note in lieu of payment of the put price when due. In either case the note would have an aggregate principal amount equal to the put price, would bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% per annum, would mature on the first anniversary of the date upon which the put price was initially due, and would be secured by the then-highest priority lien available to be placed on our equity interests in each of our businesses. 
 
Our company’s obligations under the put provision of our operating agreement are absolute and unconditional. In addition, our company will be subject to certain obligations and restrictions upon exercise of our manager’s put right until such time as our company’s obligations under the put provision of our operating agreement, including any related note, have been satisfied in full, including:
 


· | subject to our company’s right to issue a note in the circumstances described above, our company must use commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient debt or equity financing to permit our company to pay the put price or note when due and obtain approvals, waivers and consents or otherwise remove any restrictions imposed under contractual obligations or applicable law or regulations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting our company from satisfying its obligations under the supplemental put agreement or note;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | our manager will have the right to have a representative observe meetings of our company’s board of directors and have the right to receive copies of all documents and other information furnished to the board of directors; 
· | our company and its businesses will be restricted in their ability to sell or otherwise dispose of their property or assets or any businesses they own and in their ability to incur indebtedness (other than in the ordinary course of business) without granting a lien on the proceeds therefrom to our manager, which lien will secure our company’s obligations under the put provision of our operating agreement or note; and 
· | our company will be restricted in its ability to (i) engage in certain mergers or consolidations, (ii) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or a substantial part of its business, property or assets or all or a substantial portion of the stock or beneficial ownership of its businesses or a portion thereof, (iii) liquidate, wind-up or dissolve, (iv) acquire or purchase the property, assets, stock or beneficial ownership or another person, or (v) declare and pay monthly distributions.

Our company also has agreed to indemnify our manager for any losses or liabilities it incurs or suffers in connection with, arising out of or relating to its exercise of its put right or any enforcement of terms and conditions of the supplemental put provision of our operating agreement. 
 
As an obligation of our company, the put price will be paid prior to the payment of distributions to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the put price when due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to pay the put price.
 
Termination of the management services agreement, by any means, will not affect our manager’s rights with respect to the allocation shares that it owns. In this regard, our manager will retain its put right and its allocation shares after ceasing to serve as our manager. As a result, if we terminate our manager, regardless of the reason for such termination, it would retain the right to exercise the put right and demand payment of the put price.

Supplier Relationships 
 
Neese employs a variety of suppliers with two suppliers representing 10% or more of our total purchases. Neese maintains close relationships with its suppliers. Neese’s key vendors and suppliers are listed in the table below. 

Supplier | Relationship Established (Year) | Product or Service Supplied | Total Purchases (2018) | | Total Purchases (2017) | | | Percent of 2018 Purchases

Products are purchased from these suppliers on an at-will basis. Such manufacturers could discontinue sales to Neese at any time or upon short notice. If any of these suppliers discontinued selling or were unable to continue selling to Neese, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Relationships with suppliers are subject to change from time to time. Changes in Neese’s relationships with suppliers occur periodically, and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Land Application Business—We depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us.” However, we believe that we can be successful in mitigating negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in the relationships between Neese and its suppliers through, among other things, the development of new or expanded supplier relationships.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Neese relies primarily on the following methods to generate new business: 
 


· | one inside salesperson; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
· | the founders’ business development efforts; 
· | a corporate website: www.neeseinc.com; 
· | advertising in local/regional trade publications and newspapers;
· | attending agricultural trade shows; and 
· | customer referrals. 

 
We believe that Neese’s growth to date is also the result of the creation and maintenance of an excellent reputation with numerous farms and other players throughout the agricultural community of central Iowa. In addition, we believe that the founders have been instrumental in building the account base through extensive industry experience and product knowledge. Neese has a firm commitment to product quality and timely delivery, and customer satisfaction. 
 
Customers and Markets
 
Neese currently serves approximately 700 active accounts. The end user market is the agricultural industry (livestock and crop production markets). Neese also performs work for and sells to industrial and municipal customers. The general service area is within a 60-mile radius of Neese’s headquarters in Grand Junction, Iowa. 
 
We believe that Neese’s established customer base is a strong asset that contributes to its stability and presents opportunities for sales growth. Neese has a diversified customer base without reliance on several large customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer accounted for more than 10% of sales, and the next largest customer accounted for 4.3% of sales.
 
Competition
 
According to the Farm & Garden Equipment Wholesalers Industry Profile published by First Research, Inc. (June 2017), the U.S. farm and garden equipment wholesalers industry includes about 7,800 establishments (single-location companies and units of multi-location companies) with combined annual revenue of about $90 billion. This industry includes manufacturers’ wholesale sales branches as well as retail dealers in farm equipment, which are grouped with wholesalers because their products are sold primarily for business use rather than personal or household use. Large distributors have few economies of scale but can offer customers a wider range of products. Small distributors can compete successfully by holding exclusive territory rights to popular products. According to the Farm & Garden Equipment Wholesalers Industry Profile, the U.S. industry is fragmented, with the 50 largest companies generating about 40% of revenue, and no major companies dominate. 
 
Neese competes with numerous companies that offer similar products and/or services. We believe that Neese’s primary competitive advantage is its decades-long, superior reputation for high quality products, service, reliability and stability, and safety record. Additionally, Neese is located in central Iowa, a strategic location due to its proximity to the State’s agricultural industry and its easy access to Interstate 35.

Competitive Strengths
 
Based on our management’s belief and experience in the industry, we believe that the following competitive strengths enable Neese to compete effectively.
 


· | Name and reputation: We believe that Neese enjoys a long-standing (25-year) reputation for its focus on offering a full line of new and used farm equipment and parts, and providing superior waste hauling, land application, and other services with competitive pricing and superior customer service. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Strong customer relationships: We believe that Neese has strong ties to hundreds of agricultural, industrial, and municipal organizations throughout its marketplace. 
· | Highly trained and professional staff: We believe that Neese’s personnel are its most important asset. Neese employs dedicated and highly skilled professionals who have extensive industry experience. In order to ensure customers receive the most efficient and cost-effective service, Neese provides continuous safety and management training to its dedicated team of professionals.

Growth Strategies
 
We will strive to grow Neese’s business by pursuing the following growth strategies. 
 


· | Expansion of product and service lines. Neese plans to continue expanding its product and service lines based on management’s assessment of customer needs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Expansion of trucking services. Neese has increased its trucking business with a fleet of 14 trucks that it owns. The trucking business increases revenue during times when waste hauling is not as busy. 
· | Increased sales and marketing. Neese also plans to continue spending additional resources on sales and marketing personnel and strategies in order to secure new client accounts. 
· | Projected industry growth. Neese also plans to capitalize on projected industry growth. According to the Farm & Garden Equipment Wholesalers Industry Profile published by First Research, Inc. (March 2016), domestic demand for U.S. farm machinery and equipment, an indicator for wholesalers, is forecast to grow at an annual compounded rate of 5% between 2016 and 2020.

Intellectual Property
 
We do not own or license any material intellectual property in connection with the operation of Neese.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, Neese employed 27 full-time workers and 1 part-time worker, as depicted in the table below. 
 

Department/Function | Full-time Employees | Part-time Employees
--------------------+---------------------+--------------------

Mechanics | 5 | - 
General Labor | 6 | 1 
TOTALS | 27 | 1 

 
None of Neese’s employees are represented by labor unions, and Neese believes that it has an excellent relationship with its employees.
 
Regulation
 
Neese is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, which historically have not had a material effect on our business. For example, most of the products sold and service provided are regulated by a host of state and federal agencies, including, one or more of the following: the Environmental Protection Agency, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. Since we are a wholesaler (and not a manufacturer) of these products, responsibility for compliance generally falls upon the manufacturer. Neese is required to hold a commercial manure handler license which requires an annual training program.

OUR HISTORIC MANAGEMENT CONSULTING BUSINESS
 
Through 1847 Management, we previously operated a consulting and advisory services business focused on providing management consulting, finance, marketing, operational and strategic planning, relationship access, corporate development and merger and acquisition analysis services. 
 
On September 15, 2013, our subsidiary, 1847 Management, acquired a 50% interest in each of PPI Management and Christals Management from our Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder, Ellery W. Roberts. Each of PPI Management and Christals Management were management consulting and advisory firms. PPI Management acted as an advisor to PPI Acquisition Holdings, LLC, or PPI Acquisition, and its subsidiary, Pawn Plus, Inc., or Pawn Plus, and Christals Management acted as an advisor to Peekay Acquisition, LLC, or Peekay Acquisition, and its subsidiary Peekay Boutiques, Inc., or Peekay. 
 
On December 31, 2012, PPI Management entered into an advisory agreement with PPI Acquisition. Under the advisory agreement, PPI Management was retained as a consultant to render management and consulting services to PPI Acquisition and its subsidiary, Pawn Plus. As compensation for the services provided by PPI Management, PPI Acquisition was required to pay PPI Management a fee equal to 5.75% of PPI Acquisition’s EBITDA, payable as follows: (i) 3.75% of EBITDA for any fiscal quarter is payable quarterly in advance and (ii) the difference between 5.75% of EBITDA for any fiscal year and the aggregate quarterly payments previously paid with respect to fiscal quarters in such fiscal year, payable yearly in arrears. 
 
On March 1, 2016, PPI Acquisition entered into a strict foreclosure agreement with its secured lender, HD Special-Situations III, LP, or HD, pursuant to which HD foreclosed upon certain stock of Pawn Plus that was pledged to HD and HD thereby became the sole owner of Pawn Plus. On the same date, PPI Management entered into an assumption agreement with Pawn Plus pursuant to which Pawn Plus agreed to assume PPI Acquisition’s obligations under the advisory agreement with PPI Management to pay accrued management fees owed to PPI Management up to a cap of $120,000. PPI Management agreed that the accrued management fees in excess of $120,000 are forgiven and that no further fees were to accrue under the advisory agreement. In addition, PPI Management agreed that the payment of accrued management fees were subordinate to the payment by Pawn Plus of all of its obligations to HD.
 
On December 31, 2012, Christals Management and CP IV SPV, LLC, or CP IV, entered into an advisory agreement with Peekay Acquisition, pursuant to which each of Christals Management and CP IV, an entity that is not affiliated with Christals Management, our company, or Mr. Roberts, were retained to provide advisory services to Peekay Acquisition, Peekay, and its subsidiaries and affiliates. As compensation for the services provided by Christals Management, Peekay Acquisition paid Christals Management a one-time payment of $250,000 at the time the advisory agreement was entered into and was required to pay Christals Management an additional $250,000 for each fiscal year during the term. 
 
On November 19, 2015, Christals Management entered into a termination agreement with Peekay Acquisition and CP IV, which terminates the advisory agreement effective as of the closing of Peekay’s public offering, which was later abandoned. After entering into the termination agreement with Peekay Acquisition, in order to accommodate Peekay Acquisition so that it could satisfy the requirements of its senior lender, Christals Management agreed that it would further postpone receipt of any remaining accrued fees or unreimbursed expenses through the date that Peekay Acquisition repays amounts owed to its senior lenders under its senior credit facility. During the year ending December 31, 2016, our company wrote off accrued fees in the amount of $100,000 due from Peekay Acquisition and Christals Management. 
 
On October 3, 2017, our board decided to discontinue our management consulting operations in order to devote more time and resources to Neese and future acquisitions.
