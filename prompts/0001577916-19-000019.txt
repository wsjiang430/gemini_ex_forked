Item 1. Business
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion includes certain forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in the historical information and the forward-looking statements presented herein, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" contained in this Annual Report.
Our Company
Premier, Inc., incorporated in Delaware on May 14, 2013, is owned by hospitals, health systems and other healthcare organizations (such owners of Premier are referred to herein as "member owners") located in the United States, and by public stockholders. Together with our subsidiaries and affiliates, we are a leading healthcare improvement company, uniting an alliance of more than 4,000 U.S. hospitals and health systems and approximately 175,000 other providers and organizations to transform healthcare, as of June 30, 2019. With integrated data and analytics, collaboratives, supply chain solutions, and consulting and other services, Premier enables better care and outcomes at a lower cost. We believe that we play a critical role in the rapidly evolving healthcare industry, collaborating with members to co-develop long-term innovations that reinvent and improve the way care is delivered to patients nationwide. We deliver value through a comprehensive technology-enabled platform that offers critical supply chain services, clinical, financial, operational and value based care software-as-a-service ("SaaS") informatics products, consulting services and performance improvement collaborative programs.
As of June 30, 2019, we were controlled by 158 U.S. hospitals, health systems and other healthcare organizations, which represented approximately 1,450 owned, leased and managed acute care facilities in addition to other non-acute care organizations, through their ownership of Class B common stock. As of June 30, 2019, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of our combined Class A and Class B common stock. All of our Class B common stock is held beneficially by our member owners and all of our Class A common stock is held by public investors, which may include member owners that have received shares of our Class A common stock in connection with previous quarterly exchanges of Class B common units of Premier LP pursuant to an exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") entered into by the member owners in connection with the completion of our initial public offering ("IPO") on October 1, 2013 (see Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information). 
As a result of exchanges under the Exchange Agreement, as of July 31, 2019, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock represented approximately 50.2% and 49.8%, respectively, of our combined Class A and Class B common stock and accordingly, the Class B common stock held by member owners no longer represents the majority of our outstanding common stock. Since the holders of Class B stock no longer hold more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, the Company no longer qualifies for the "controlled company" exemption as defined by NASDAQ. As a result, we must comply with all general NASDAQ corporate governance guidelines. In anticipation of the change in controlled company status, we have been planning for this evolution and expect to comply with all NASDAQ general corporate governance guidelines in a timely manner, including having a majority of independent directors on the Board of Directors within one year.
As a healthcare alliance, our mission, products and services, and long-term strategy have been developed in partnership with our member hospitals, health systems and other healthcare organizations. We believe that this partnership-driven business model creates a relationship between our members and us that is characterized by aligned incentives and mutually beneficial collaboration. This relationship affords us access to critical proprietary data and encourages member participation in the development and introduction of new Premier products and services. Our interaction with our members provides us additional insights into the latest challenges confronting the industry we serve and innovative best practices that we can share broadly within the healthcare industry, including throughout our membership. This model has enabled us to develop size and scale, data and analytics assets, expertise and customer engagement required to accelerate innovation, provide differentiated solutions and facilitate growth.
We seek to address challenges facing healthcare providers through our comprehensive suite of solutions that we believe:

• | improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare supply chain;


• | deliver improvement in cost, quality and safety;


• | innovate and enable success in emerging healthcare delivery and payment models to manage the health of populations; and


• | utilize data and analytics to drive increased connectivity, and clinical, financial and operational improvement.

7

Our business model and solutions are designed to provide our members with access to scale efficiencies while focusing on optimization of information resources and cost containment, derive intelligence from our anonymized data provided by our members in our enterprise data warehouse, mitigate the risk of innovation and disseminate best practices that will help our member organizations succeed in their transformation to higher quality and more cost-effective healthcare.
We deliver our integrated platform of solutions that address the areas of total cost management, quality and safety improvement and population health management and manage our business through two reportable business segments: Supply Chain Services and Performance Services. The Supply Chain Services segment includes our GPO and direct sourcing activities. The Performance Services segment includes our SaaS informatics products, collaboratives, consulting services, government services and insurance management services businesses.
Recent Developments
Acquisition of Stanson
On November 9, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock in Stanson Health, Inc. ("Stanson") for an adjusted purchase price of $55.4 million. Stanson is a SaaS-based provider of clinical decision support tools that are integrated directly into the electronic health record workflow to help provide real-time, patient-specific best practices at the point of care. Stanson is reported as part of the Performance Services segment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.
Divestiture of Specialty Pharmacy Business - Discontinued Operations
On June 7, 2019, we completed the sale of prescription files and records and certain other assets used in our specialty pharmacy business for $22.3 million. We also received $7.6 million related to the sale of a portion of our pharmaceutical inventory on June 10, 2019 and $3.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 primarily in connection with the sale of our remaining pharmaceutical inventory. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we finalized and commenced a plan to wind down and exit from the specialty pharmacy business. We recognized non-cash impairment charges of $80.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 related to goodwill, purchased intangibles and other assets of the specialty pharmacy business that were not sold or did not have an alternative use.
We met the criteria for classifying certain assets and liabilities of the specialty pharmacy business as a discontinued operation as of June 30, 2019. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Annual Report has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 - Discontinued Operations and Exit Activities to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.
Industry Overview
According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, healthcare expenditures are a large component of the U.S. economy and are expected to grow by an average of 5.5% per year for the period 2018-2027, reaching 19.4% of gross domestic product, or GDP, by 2027. According to data from the 2016 American Hospital Association's Annual Survey, published in the 2019 edition of the AHA Hospital Statistics™, there were approximately 5,300 U.S. community hospitals with approximately 798,900 staffed beds in the United States. Of these acute care facilities, approximately 3,500 were part of either multi-hospital or diversified single hospital systems, meaning they were owned, leased, sponsored or contract managed by a central organization. Based upon 2018 reporting from the United States Department of Labor and healthcare industry sources, in addition to U.S. hospitals, there were approximately 673,000 alternate site facilities and providers across the continuum of care in the United States. These alternate site facilities include primary/ambulatory care and post-acute care providers. Increasingly, these alternate site facilities are being acquired by, integrated into or aligned with acute care facilities, further developing and enhancing integrated delivery networks.
Healthcare Supply Chain Services Industry
According to CMS data, total spending on hospital services in the United States is projected to be approximately $1.3 trillion, or approximately 33% of total healthcare expenditures, in 2019. Expenses associated with the hospital supply chain, such as supplies and operational and capital expenditures, typically represent a significant portion of a hospital's budget. With continued reimbursement rate pressure across government and managed care payers, a transitioning payment model from fee-for-service to value-based payment, and national health expenditures representing a significant portion of the economy, healthcare providers are examining all sources of cost savings, with supply chain spending a key area of focus. We believe opportunities to drive cost out of the healthcare supply chain include improved pricing for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, purchased services, facilities expenditures, food service supplies, and information technology, as well as appropriate resource utilization and increased operational efficiency.

From origination at the supplier to final consumption by the provider or patient, healthcare products pass through an extensive supply chain incorporating distributors, GPOs, pharmacy benefit managers, and retail, long-term care and integrated pharmacies, among others. In response to the national focus on health spending and managing healthcare costs, supply chain participants are seeking more convenient and cost-efficient ways to deliver products to patients and providers. We believe that improvements to the healthcare supply chain to bring it on par with other industries that have more sophisticated supply chain management can drive out significant inefficiencies and cost. 
Healthcare Performance Services Industry
State and federal budget pressures from public healthcare spending, employer and consumer demands for lower costs, and the need for improved quality and outcomes have generated greater focus among healthcare providers on cost management, quality and safety, and population health management. As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") has embarked on an aggressive effort over the past two administrations to move from fee-for-service to alternative payment models ("APMs"). APMs, such as accountable care organizations ("ACOs") or bundled payment arrangements, make healthcare providers more accountable for cost and quality goals. This movement was advanced further with the bipartisan enactment of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, which created incentives for physicians to move to APMs. Even with the possibility of changes to the ACA, this movement has continued. Over the long-term, health systems will need to continually monitor performance and manage costs, while demonstrating high levels of quality and implementing new care delivery models
We expect information technology to continue to play a key enabling role in workflow efficiency and cost reduction, performance improvement and care delivery transformation across the healthcare industry. In particular, the trends toward value-based payment models and population-based healthcare require more sophisticated business intelligence, expanded data sets and technology solutions. To achieve higher-quality outcomes and control total cost of care, providers exhibit a strong and continuing need for more comprehensive data and analytic capabilities to help them understand their current and future performance, identify opportunities for improvement and manage population health risk. We expect demand for data management and data analytics products to complement the focus on electronic health record adoption. Similarly, our consulting services business is growing in the areas of business model strategy and redesign, process improvement, labor productivity, non-labor cost management, clinical integration and change management.
Our Membership
Our current membership base includes many of the country's most progressive and forward-thinking healthcare organizations. The participation of these organizations in our membership provides us additional insights into the latest challenges confronting the industry we serve and innovative best practices that we can share broadly throughout our membership. We continually seek to add new members that are at the forefront of innovation in the healthcare industry. At June 30, 2019, our members included more than 4,000 U.S. hospitals and health systems and approximately 175,000 other providers and organizations. Approximately 400 individuals, representing more than 130 of our U.S. hospital members, sit on 28 of our strategic and sourcing committees, and as part of these committees, use their industry expertise to advise on ways to improve the development, quality and value of our products and services. In addition, at June 30, 2019, ten current or former senior executives from our U.S. hospital member owner systems served on our Board of Directors. Other than Acurity, Inc., an affiliate of GNYHA Purchasing Alliance, LLC ("GNYHA PA"), and its member organizations, which accounted for 10%, 10% and 9% of our net revenue in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, no individual member or member owner systems accounted for more than 5% of our net revenue in such periods. Total GPO purchasing volume by all members participating in our GPO was more than $61 billion and $60 billion for the calendar years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to retention rates for members participating in our GPO in the Supply Chain Services segment and renewal rates for our SaaS informatics products subscriptions in the Performance Services segment for the fiscal years shown:

 | Year Ended June 30, | 
 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 3 Year Average
GPO retention rate (a) | 97% | 98% | 99% | 98% 
SaaS institutional renewal rate (b) | 96% | 97% | 95% | 96% 


(a) | The GPO retention rate is calculated based upon the aggregate purchasing volume among all members participating in our GPO for such fiscal year less the annualized GPO purchasing volume for departed members for such fiscal year, divided by the aggregate purchasing volume among all members participating in our GPO for such fiscal year.


(b) | The SaaS institutional renewal rate is calculated based upon the total number of members that have SaaS revenue in a given period that also have revenue in the corresponding prior year period divided by the total number of members that have SaaS revenue in the same period of the prior year.

Our Business Segments
We deliver our integrated platform of solutions that address the areas of total cost management, quality and safety improvement and population health management and manage our business through two business segments: Supply Chain Services and Performance Services, as addressed in Note 19 - Segments to the audited consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report. We have no significant foreign operations or revenues.
Supply Chain Services
Our Supply Chain Services segment assists our members in managing their non-labor expense and capital spend through a combination of products, services and technologies, including one of the largest national healthcare GPOs in the United States serving acute and alternate sites and direct sourcing activities. Membership in our GPO also provides access to certain SaaS informatics products related to the supply chain and the opportunity to participate in our ASCEND® and SURPASS® collaboratives. Our Supply Chain Services segment consists of the following products and solutions:
Group Purchasing. Our national portfolio of approximately 2,500 contracts with approximately 1,300 suppliers provides our members with access to a wide range of products and services, including medical and surgical products, pharmaceuticals, laboratory supplies, capital equipment, information technology, facilities and construction, food and nutritional products and purchased services (such as clinical engineering and document shredding services). We use our members' aggregate purchasing power to negotiate pricing discounts and improved contract terms with suppliers. Contracted suppliers pay us administrative fees based on the purchase volume of goods and services sold to our healthcare provider members under the contracts we have negotiated. We also partner with other organizations, including regional GPOs, to extend our network base to their members.
Our contract portfolio is designed to offer our healthcare provider members a flexible solution comprised of multi-sourced supplier contracts, as well as pre-commitment and/or single-sourced contracts that offer higher discounts. Our multi-sourced contracts offer pricing tiers based on purchasing volume and/or commitment and multiple suppliers for many products and services. Our pre-commitment contracts require that a certain amount of our members commit in advance to a specified amount or percentage of purchasing volume before we enter into a contract with a particular supplier. Our single-source contracts are entered into with a specified supplier, and through this exclusive relationship, allow us to contract for products that meet our members' specifications. In the case of pre-commitment contracts, we provide the particular supplier with a list of members that have pre-committed to a specified amount or percentage of purchasing volume and the supplier directly handles the tracking and monitoring of fulfillment of such purchasing volume. In the case of single and multi-sourced contracts, we negotiate and execute the contracts with suppliers on behalf of our members and make such contracts available to our members to access. The utilization of such single and multi-sourced contracts is determined by the particular member with assistance from our field force. Since there are no specific fulfillment requirements needed in our single and multi-source contracts in order to obtain certain pricing levels, each particular member and supplier agree on the appropriate pricing tier based on expected purchasing volume with tracking and ongoing validation of such purchasing volume provided by the supplier. The flexibility provided by our expansive contract portfolio allows us to effectively address the varying needs of our members and the significant number of factors that influence and dictate these needs, including overall size, service mix, and the degree of integration between hospitals in a health system.
We continually innovate our GPO programs and supply chain platforms while targeting multiple markets, including acute care and alternate site settings. Our Premier Alternate Site Program, one of the largest in the United States, covers over 70 classes of trade with approximately 175,000 members as of June 30, 2019, and includes the following:
Premier Alternate Site. Key classes of trade include long-term care dispensing pharmacies and senior living facilities, home IV infusion providers, home health and surgery centers. Premier Alternate Site GPO members have access to most of our GPO supplier contracts, including, but not limited to, pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical supplies, facilities, food and nutritional products and other purchased services. 
Premier Business and Industry. Key classes of trade include non-healthcare entities, such as education (e.g. K-12 schools, colleges and universities), hospitality, recreation (e.g. stadiums, parks and fairgrounds), and employee food programs. Our Business and Industry members have access to most of our GPO supplier contracts, including food service, facilities, informational services and administrative services.
Direct Sourcing. Our direct sourcing business, SVS, LLC d/b/a S2S Global ("S2S Global"), was established to help our members access a diverse product portfolio and to provide transparency to manufacturing costs and competitive pricing to our members. Through our consolidated subsidiary, S2S Global, we facilitate the development of product specifications with our members, source or contract manufacture the products to member specifications and sell products directly to our members or suppliers. By engaging with our members at the beginning of the sourcing process to define product specifications and 
10

then sourcing, or contract manufacturing, products to meet the exact needs of our members, we eliminate the need for unnecessary product features and specifications that may typically be included by suppliers and result in higher prices for our members without providing incremental value. Therefore, our direct sourcing activities benefit our members by providing them with an expanding portfolio of medical products through more efficient means, and with greater cost transparency, than if such products were purchased from other third-party suppliers. We market our direct sourcing activities primarily under the PREMIERPRO® brand.
SaaS Informatics Products. Members of our GPO have access to certain components of our PREMIERCONNECT Supply Chain offering and its associated applications and the ability to purchase additional elements that are discussed in more detail below under "Our Business Segments - Performance Services". 
ASCEND® Collaborative. Our ASCEND Collaborative has developed a process to aggregate purchasing data for our members, enabling such members to determine whether to negotiate committed group purchases within the Collaborative. Through our ASCEND Collaborative, members receive group purchasing programs, tiers and prices specifically negotiated for them, as well as benchmarking metrics to assist them in identifying additional supply chain and operations cost savings opportunities and knowledge sharing with other member participants and industry experts. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 1,050 U.S. hospital members, which represent approximately 136,000 hospital beds, participated in the ASCEND Collaborative. These hospital member participants have identified approximately $430.0 million in additional savings as compared to their U.S. hospital peers not participating in the ASCEND Collaborative since its inception in 2009. For calendar year 2018, these member participants had approximately $21.0 billion in annual supply chain purchasing spend.
SURPASS® Collaborative. Our SURPASS Collaborative builds upon and complements our existing ASCEND Collaborative that drives even greater savings for members; at a correspondingly higher level of commitment.  The SURPASS Collaborative brings together our most committed members that are able to coordinate purchasing decisions, review utilization and achieve and maintain standardization across their facilities. The SURPASS Collaborative utilizes our PACER (Partnership for the Advancement of Comparative Effectiveness Review) methodology, which brings together clinically led cohorts to make evidence-based decisions about physician and clinician preference items with the goal of materially reducing the total cost of care. As of June 30, 2019, a core group of nine members representing approximately 30,000 hospital beds participated in our SURPASS Collaborative. These hospital member participants have identified approximately $49 million in additional savings via their efforts in approximately 60 categories. The SURPASS Collaborative has another 100 categories slated for the coming year as well as select initiatives related to utilization and standardization.
E-Commerce Platform. Our E-Commerce platform, STOCKDTM, is part of our multi-channel supply chain strategy. Initially focused on our Alternate Site providers, this program will provide a marketplace where providers can purchase from Premier GPO suppliers utilizing a user-friendly e-commerce platform as the foundation for more efficient integrated delivery system ordering platform. We expect a number of additional key suppliers to participate in this initiative over time as providers look to a more convenient and less arduous approach to supply chain purchasing.
PROVIDEGXTM Program. The PROVIDEGX program identifies high-quality supply sources for drugs that are on or may be at risk of being added to the national drug shortage list or that are vulnerable to pricing volatility. The PROVIDEGX program is the next step in our ongoing effort to help facilitate the availability of high-quality products, including drugs for which there may be supply challenges.
Performance Services
Our offerings in the performance services sector of the healthcare industry are primarily information technology analytics and workflow automation and consulting services. We believe we are one of the largest informatics and consulting services businesses in the United States focused on healthcare providers, professional associations, pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers. Our SaaS informatics products utilize our comprehensive data set to provide actionable intelligence to our members, enabling them to benchmark, analyze and identify areas of improvement across three main categories: cost management, quality and safety, and population health management. This segment also includes our technology-enabled performance improvement collaboratives, through which we convene members, design programs and facilitate, foster and advance the exchange of clinical, financial and operational data among our members to measure patient outcomes and determine best practices that drive clinical, financial and operational improvements. Our Performance Services segment includes our PREMIERCONNECT® technology offerings, consulting services, collaboratives, government services and insurance management services, as follows:
PREMIERCONNECT® Platform:
We seek to deliver our healthcare cloud applications using an innovative technology foundation that leverages the most recent advances in cloud computing and data management. Our PREMIERCONNECT platform allows us to deliver applications that are highly flexible and extendable across healthcare delivery systems. We leverage advanced data science in our informatics 
11

applications to help members make smarter cost and quality decisions. We also provide complete packaged integrations and connectors for our cloud-based solutions to operate in conjunction with legacy healthcare IT systems, which substantially reduces time, complexity and cost associated with integrations for our members. 
PREMIERCONNECT is designed to deliver specific functionalities to our members to address existing cost and quality imperatives, help them manage a value-based care reimbursement model and support their regulatory reporting framework. We also provide members optimized web-based communities and research capabilities to capture utilization best practices and clinical surveillance improvement. Our service models allow members to consistently use our resources to inform vital decisions. PREMIERCONNECT solutions are organized into five areas: Quality & Regulatory reporting, Clinical Surveillance & Safety, Supply Chain & ERP, Operations and integrated Enterprise Analytics.
PREMIERCONNECT Quality & Regulatory. The PREMIERCONNECT Quality & Regulatory domain enables health systems and providers to identify and target high-value quality improvement areas that drive greater clinical effectiveness and efficiency across the continuum of care. This solution provides clinical benchmarking, population analyses and predictive analytics to help hospitals and physician practices be successful in the transition to value-based care.
PREMIERCONNECT Clinical Surveillance & Safety. The PREMIERCONNECT Clinical Surveillance & Safety domain enables health systems and providers to improve patient safety, including ongoing infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, reduction of hospital-acquired conditions and real-time clinical surveillance used to drive faster, more informed decisions.
PREMIERCONNECT Supply Chain & ERP. The PREMIERCONNECT Supply Chain & ERP domain enables health systems and providers to lower supply chain costs through leading supply chain management analytics, evidence-based purchasing, and innovative enterprise resource planning ("ERP") workflow that drives efficiency and effectiveness throughout the entire procurement life cycle. This healthcare-only ERP solution also extends into accounts payable, general ledger and financial reporting.
PREMIERCONNECT Operations. The PREMIERCONNECT Operations domain enables health systems and providers to optimize labor management with integrated financial reporting and budgeting across the continuum of care. These applications integrate benchmarking and productivity data from acute, outpatient and ambulatory settings.
PREMIERCONNECT Enterprise Analytics. The PREMIERCONNECT Enterprise Analytics domain enables health systems and providers to leverage integrated analytics across all of Premier's subject matter expertise. This solution includes integrating a member's custom data into a hosted and integrated data warehouse and analytics platform. This solution provides data acquisition, management and governance capabilities for health systems and extends this capability to research, life sciences and value-based care programs.
PREMIERCONNECT Clinical Decision Support. The PREMIERCONNECT Clinical Decision Support domain enables integrated electronic health record workflow to help provide real-time, patient-specific best practices at the point of care.
Consulting Services:
Our consulting services, provided through Premier Performance Partners, seek to drive change and improvement in cost reduction, quality of care and patient safety, and prepare our members to succeed in a population health environment. We use an income statement method to address every area affecting the member's bottom line, finding opportunities in both revenue enhancement and expense management. Premier Performance Partners offers expertise and capabilities in the following areas: care coordination and physician engagement, clinical, financial and operational performance, facilities and capital asset management, organizational transformation, physician preference items (PPI), reform readiness assessment, clinical integration and population health operations and analytics, purchased services assessment, revenue cycle management and recovery audit contractor (RAC) readiness, service line improvement, strategic and business planning and supply chain transformation.
We provide a data-driven approach and expertise to deliver targeted results in reducing costs, increasing margin and improving quality. Using various specialists and consultants, we provide wrap-around services for our major SaaS informatics products and our GPO to enhance the member value from these programs. For example, our clinical performance partners provide U.S. hospitals with access to performance improvement and operational specialists. Using our informatics tools and applications, these clinical performance consultants mine data for improvement opportunities and then lead or assist with improvement projects in such areas as resource and operational assessments, process improvement, performance improvement monitoring, strategic planning and knowledge transfer for organizational change. U.S. hospitals contract for clinical, financial and/or operational performance partner support for a given number of days per month, with contracts typically lasting from less than a year to five years in duration.

Performance Improvement Collaboratives:
QUEST® Collaborative. Through our QUEST Collaborative, we work with our members to identify improvement opportunities and best practices and engage them to participate in performance improvement exercises using identified best practices, to collaborate to define performance goals and to use healthy competition to drive performance improvement. The QUEST Collaborative builds on the past success of our partnership with CMS in the Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration, a value-based purchase program through which CMS awarded bonus payments to U.S. hospitals for high quality in several clinical areas and reported quality data on its website. The QUEST Collaborative currently targets improvements in the following domains: evidence-based care, cost and efficiency of care, patient and family engagement, safety, mortality and appropriate U.S. hospital use and community health. Historically, there were approximately 350 participating U.S. hospitals in the QUEST 3.0 Collaborative, which sunset on December 31, 2016. In January 2017, we launched the QUEST 2020 Collaborative, which was expanded to include additional focus areas, and which will continue to operate for the next three years. As of June 30, 2019, there were more than 240 U.S. hospitals that have signed up for the QUEST 2020 Collaborative and that are working together to utilize our SaaS informatics products to develop highly standardized quality, safety and cost metrics. The QUEST Collaborative seeks to develop next-generation quality, safety and cost metrics with a consistency and standardization we do not believe exists elsewhere today. We believe that our members who participate in the QUEST Collaborative are better prepared to deal with evolving and uncertain healthcare reform requirements and, by improving in the domains referenced above, can earn Medicare incentives, avoid Medicare penalties and better manage reimbursement cuts.
Bundled Payment Collaborative. Our Bundled Payment Collaborative assists our members in their participation in the CMS Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative, an initiative by which organizations enter into payment arrangements that include financial and performance accountability for episodes of care. Our Bundled Payment Collaborative offers ongoing analysis of our members' Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B data, dashboards for managing bundled payment programs and gainsharing, in addition to providing knowledge, expertise, and best practices from experts and members. As of June 30, 2019, we had over 120 U.S. hospitals participating in our Bundled Payment Collaborative.
The Population Health Management Collaboratives. Our Population Health Management Collaborative, or PHM Collaborative (the successor to our PACTTM-Partnership for Care Transformation Collaborative), is focused on helping members develop and implement effective models of care and payment for connected groups of providers who take responsibility for improving the health status, efficiency and experience of care (quality and satisfaction) for a defined population (i.e., accountable care organizations) and how to align this care redesign with new value based payment arrangements. Our PHM Collaborative provides members with the opportunity to share value based care and payment developmental strategies, programs, and other best practices. The PHM Collaborative provides valuable assistance and access to over 30 PHM subject matter experts to members in developing the tools necessary to manage the health of a population and to exchange knowledge with each other and with industry and government experts. As of June 30, 2019, we had over 500 U.S. hospitals in 42 states participating in our PHM Collaborative.
Hospital Improvement and Innovation Network (formerly Partnership for Patients Collaborative). In September 2016, CMS awarded us a Partnership for Patients ("PfP") Hospital Improvement Innovation Network ("HIIN") contract to continue our prior Hospital Engagement Network efforts. The PfP initiative is a public-private collaborative working to improve the quality, safety and affordability of healthcare. Physicians, nurses, hospitals, employers, patients and their advocates, and the federal and state governments have joined together to form PfP to decrease preventable hospital-acquired conditions and readmissions. Our HIIN serves as a live learning lab for hospitals and utilizes HIIN partners to accelerate improvement efforts throughout multiple healthcare areas. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 500 U.S. hospitals participating in our HIIN Collaborative. Our three-year contract expired on June 27, 2019, and month-to-month funding has continued through August 2019 at a reduced level. However, the further continuation of this program is uncertain at this time.
Academic Collaborative. The Premier Academic Innovators Collaborative and the corresponding pharmacy and supply chain committees meet to advance and collaborate on academic health system-specific cost-related activities such as contract and pricing tier structures and opportunities to support aggregation that best support the needs of the academic health systems, explore strategies to foster greater clinical integration into the supply chain and value analysis decision-making process in academic health systems, explore opportunities to collaborate on clinically sensitive and new/breakthrough technology categories and establish sourcing strategies for academic health systems. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 60 academic health systems were Premier members, a subset of which participated in the Academic Collaborative in order to benefit the entirety of our academic membership.
Insurance Services: We provide insurance programs and services to assist U.S. hospital and healthcare system members with liability and benefits insurance services, along with risk management services. We design insurance programs and services for our members to improve their quality, patient safety and financial performance while lowering costs. We provide 
13

management services for American Excess Insurance Exchange, Risk Retention Group, a reciprocal risk retention group that provides excess hospital, professional, umbrella and general liability insurance to certain U.S. hospital and healthcare system members. We also negotiate the purchase of other insurance products from commercial insurance carriers on behalf of our members.
Pricing and Contracts
We generate revenue from our Supply Chain Services segment through fees received from suppliers based on the total dollar volume of supplies purchased by our members in connection with our GPO programs and through product sales in connection with our direct sourcing activities. Our Performance Services segment has four main sources of revenue: (i) three to five-year subscription agreements to our SaaS informatics products, (ii) annual subscriptions to our performance improvement collaboratives, (iii) professional fees for our consulting services, and (iv) licensing revenue.
Supply Chain Services
Pursuant to the terms of GPO participation agreements entered into by the member owners (see Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information), the overwhelming majority of our member owners currently receive revenue share from Premier LP equal to 30% of all gross administrative fees collected by Premier LP based upon purchasing by such member owner's owned, leased, managed and affiliated facilities through our GPO supplier contracts. 
In addition, our two largest regional GPO member owners, which represented an aggregate of approximately 13% of our gross administrative fees revenue for the year ended June 30, 2019, each remit gross administrative fees collected by such member owner based upon purchasing by such member owner's owned, leased, managed and affiliated facilities through the member owner's own GPO supplier contracts, in accordance with such member owner's Premier GPO participation agreement, and receive revenue share from Premier LP equal to 30% of such gross administrative fees remitted to us.
Due to competitive market conditions, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience requests, at times, to provide existing and prospective members increases in revenue share on incremental and/or overall purchasing volume. Subject to certain early termination rights, these GPO participation agreements generally have five-year renewable terms that initially expire on September 30, 2023, although our two largest regional GPO member owners have entered into agreements with seven-year renewable terms that initially expire on September 30, 2020. 
In general, our GPO participation agreements automatically extend for successive five-year or seven-year periods (corresponding to the length of their initial terms) unless the member owner notifies Premier LP, prior to the fourth anniversary (or September 30, 2022 in the case of five-year agreements), or sixth anniversary (or September 30, 2019 in the case of seven-year agreements), of the commencement of the then-current term, that such member owner does not want the GPO participation agreement to automatically renew upon the expiration of the then-current term. We are currently working with the member owners with initial seven-year terms to achieve renewal or extension of those agreements.
The terms and conditions of certain GPO participation agreements vary as a result of provisions in our pre-IPO arrangements with member owners that conflict with the provisions of our standard GPO participation agreements and which by the express terms of the GPO participation agreements are incorporated by reference and deemed controlling and will continue to remain in effect. In limited circumstances, Premier LP and certain member owners entered into GPO participation agreements at the time of the IPO with certain terms and conditions that vary from the standard form. The agreements were approved by the member agreement review committee of our Board of Directors, based upon regulatory constraints, pending merger and acquisition activity or other unusual circumstances affecting those member owners. In addition, some of our GPO participation agreements with member owners have been extended on terms that vary from their original terms.
In addition to our core base of approximately 2,500 acute care healthcare providers, our Premier Alternate Site Programs had approximately 175,000 active members as of June 30, 2019, which represents an increase of approximately 10,000 members, or 6%, over fiscal year 2018. A number of these alternate site members are affiliated, owned, leased, or managed by our member owners. As a result, these member owners have traditionally received a revenue share from us equal to approximately 30% of our collected gross administrative fees on their members' purchases. 
In addition, certain alternate site non-owner members operate under contractual relationships that provide for a specific revenue share that differs from the aforementioned percentage that we generally provide to our member owners under the current GPO agreements. In fiscal year 2019, approximately 22,000 members had this type of contract.
In our group purchasing services activities, we also receive revenue in the form of a service fee for the provision of group purchasing and related services to the Academic Innovators Collaborative.

In our direct sourcing activities, we earn revenue from product sales, including sales from aggregated purchases of certain products, as well as, in some cases, service or licensing fees. Products are sold to our members through direct shipment and distributor and wholesale channels. Products are also sold to regional medical-surgical distributors and other non-healthcare industries (i.e., foodservice). We have contracts with our members that buy products through our direct shipment option. These contracts do not usually provide a guaranteed purchase or volume commitment requirement. 
Performance Services
Performance Services revenue consists of SaaS informatics products subscriptions, certain perpetual and term licenses, performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions, professional fees for consulting services, and insurance services management fees and commissions from group-sponsored insurance programs.
SaaS informatics subscriptions include the right to use our proprietary hosted technology on a SaaS basis, training and member support to deliver improvements in cost management, quality and safety, value-based care and provider analytics. Pricing varies by application and size of the healthcare system. Informatics subscriptions are generally three- to five-year agreements with automatic renewal clauses and annual price escalators that typically do not allow for early termination. These agreements do not allow for physical possession of the software. Subscription fees are typically billed on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized as a single deliverable on a straight-line basis over the remaining contractual period following implementation. Implementation involves the completion of data preparation services that are unique to each member's data set and, in certain cases, the installation of member site-specific software, in order to access and transfer member data into our hosted SaaS informatics products. Implementation is generally 60 to 240 days following contract execution before the SaaS informatics products can be fully utilized by the member.
Revenue from performance improvement collaboratives and other service subscriptions that support our offerings in cost management, quality and safety and value-based care is recognized over the service period as the services are provided, which is generally one year.
Professional fees for consulting services are sold under contracts, the terms of which vary based on the nature of the engagement. These services typically include general consulting, report-based consulting and cost savings initiatives. Fees are billed as stipulated in the contract, and revenue is recognized on a proportional performance method as services are performed or when deliverables are provided. In situations where the contracts have significant contract performance guarantees or member acceptance provisions, revenue recognition occurs when the fees are fixed and determinable and all contingencies, including any refund rights, have been satisfied. Fees are based either on time and materials or the savings that are delivered.
Sales
We conduct sales through our embedded field force, our dedicated national sales team, our Premier Performance Partners consultants, and our Alternate Site team, collectively comprised of approximately 700 employees as of June 30, 2019.
Our field force works closely with our U.S. hospital members and other members to target new opportunities by developing strategic and operational plans to drive cost management and quality and safety improvement initiatives. As of June 30, 2019, our field force was deployed to six geographic regions and several strategic/affinity members across the United States. This field force works at our member sites to identify and recommend best practices for both supply chain and clinical integration cost savings opportunities. The regionally deployed field force is augmented by a national team of subject matter specialists who focus on key areas such as lab, surgery, cardiology, orthopedics, imaging, pharmacy, information technology and construction. Our field force assists our members in growing and supporting their alternate site membership.
Our sales team provides national sales coverage for establishing initial member relationships and works with our field force to increase sales to existing members. Our regional sales teams are aligned with the six regions in our field force model.
Our Premier Performance Partners team identifies and targets consulting engagements and wrap-around services for our major SaaS informatics products and our GPO to enhance the member value from these programs.
Our Alternate Site team has approximately 100 internal and external sales representatives servicing these classes of trade. Many of the representatives provide a dual role of both enhancing contract penetration (selling current members additional contracts) as well as bringing on new providers to the program.
Intellectual Property
We offer our members a range of products to which we have appropriate intellectual property rights, including online services, best practices content, databases, electronic tools, web-based applications, performance metrics, business methodologies, proprietary algorithms, software products and consulting services deliverables. We own and control a variety of trade secrets, 
15

confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business.
We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual arrangements. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and, similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
Research and Development
Our research and development ("R&D") expenditures primarily consist of our strategic investment in internally-developed software to develop new and enhance existing SaaS informatics products offerings and new product development in the areas of cost management, quality and safety and value based care. From time to time, we may experience fluctuations in our research and development expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, across reportable periods due to the timing of our software development life cycles, with new product features and functionality, new technologies and upgrades to our service offerings.
Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risk Management
We rely on digital technology to conduct our business operations and engage with our members and business partners. The technology we, our members, and business partners use grows more complex over time as do threats to our business operations from cyber intrusions, denial of service attacks, manipulation and other cyber misconduct. Through a risk management approach that continually assesses and improves our Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity risk deterrence capabilities, our Information Security and Risk Management groups have formed a functional collaboration to provide leadership and oversight when managing IT and cybersecurity risks. 
Through a combination of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) resources, we have significantly improved our capability to (i) proactively monitor IT controls to better ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (ii) assess adherence by third parties we partner with to secure that the appropriate risk management standards are met, (iii) better ensure essential business functions remain available during a business disruption, and (iv) monitor and continually develop and update response plans to address potential weaknesses and IT or cyber incidents should they occur. Our GRC resources are designed to prioritize IT and cybersecurity risks areas, identify solutions that minimize such risks, pursue optimal outcomes and maintain compliance with contractual obligations. We also maintain an operational security function that has a real time 24x7x365 response capability that triages incident management and triggers impact mitigation protocols. These capabilities allow us to apply best practices and reduce exposure in the case of a security incident. For more information regarding the risks associated with these matters, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors-We could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber-attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other third parties."
Competition
The markets for our products and services in both our Supply Chain Services segment and Performance Services segment are fragmented, intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and product standards, user needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of companies. 
The primary competitors to our Supply Chain Services segment are other large GPOs such as HealthTrust Purchasing Group (a subsidiary of HCA Holdings, Inc.), Intalere Inc., Managed Health Care Associates, Inc. and Vizient, Inc. In addition, we compete against certain healthcare provider-owned GPOs and on-line retailers in this segment. Our direct sourcing activities compete primarily with private label offerings/programs, product manufacturers, and distributors, such as Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corporation, Medline Industries, Inc. and Owens & Minor, Inc. 
The competitors in our Performance Services segment range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities. Our primary competitors in this segment include (i) information technology providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Cerner Corporation, Change Healthcare, Epic Systems Corporation, Health Catalyst, Inc., IBM Corporation, Infor, Inc. and Oracle Corporation, and (ii) consulting and outsourcing firms such as Deloitte & Touche LLP, Evolent Health, Inc., Healthagen, LLC (a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc.), Huron Consulting, Inc., Navigant Consulting, Inc., Optum, Inc. (a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Inc.) and Vizient, Inc. 
With respect to our products and services across both segments, we compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvements through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition and 
16

the ability to integrate services with existing technology. With respect to our products and services across both of our business segments, we also compete on the basis of price. 
Government Regulation
General
The healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal and state authorities and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. Factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, consolidation in the healthcare industry, regulation, litigation and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices, operations and the financial health of healthcare organizations. In particular, changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, such as increased regulation of the purchase and sale of medical products, or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements, could require us to make unplanned modifications of our products and services, result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce funds and demand for our products and services.
We are subject to numerous risks arising from governmental oversight and regulation. You should carefully review the following discussion and the risks discussed under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a more detailed discussion.
Affordable Care Act (ACA)
The ACA is a sweeping regulatory measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending and improve healthcare quality. The law includes provisions to tie Medicare provider reimbursement to healthcare quality and incentives, mandatory compliance programs, enhanced transparency disclosure requirements, increased funding and initiatives to address fraud and abuse and incentives to state Medicaid programs to promote community-based care as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. In addition, the law provides for the establishment of an innovation center to test and scale new APMs as well as the establishment of ACOs. These programs are creating fundamental changes in the delivery of healthcare. Likewise, many states have adopted or are considering changes in healthcare policies in part due to state budgetary shortfalls. Ongoing uncertainty regarding implementation of certain aspects of the ACA makes it difficult to predict the impact the ACA or state law proposals may have on our business. The Trump administration and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to repeal, replace, modify or delay implementation of the ACA through both legislative and regulatory action. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), which eliminates the individual insurance mandate beginning in 2019.  On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued his first executive order titled "Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal," that directs federal regulators to begin dismantling the ACA through regulatory and policy-making processes and procedures, "to the maximum extent permitted by law." In June 2017, the House of Representatives passed legislation to repeal and replace the ACA, however in July 2017, the Senate rejected legislation to repeal and replace the ACA.  The 2018 election resulted in renewed uncertainty with the Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, while the Senate remained Republican controlled. Moreover, there is currently a lawsuit brought by a group of state Attorney Generals challenging the constitutionality of the ACA. Any future changes may ultimately impact the provisions of the ACA or other laws or regulations that either currently affect, or may in the future affect, our business.
Civil and Criminal Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect patients, governmental healthcare programs and private health plans from fraudulent and abusive activities. These laws include anti-kickback restrictions and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims. These laws are complex and broadly-worded, and their application to our specific products, services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have over time increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules. These laws and regulations include:
Anti-Kickback Laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to influence the purchase, lease or ordering of healthcare items and services regardless of whether the item or service is covered under a governmental health program or private health plan. Certain statutory and regulatory safe harbors exist that protect specified business arrangements from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all elements of an applicable safe harbor are met, however these safe harbors are narrow and often difficult to comply with. Congress has appropriated an increasing amount of funds in recent years to support enforcement activities aimed at reducing healthcare fraud and abuse.
17

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, created certain safe harbor regulations which, if fully complied with, assure parties to a particular arrangement covered by a safe harbor that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. We attempt to structure our group purchasing services, pricing discount arrangements with suppliers, and revenue share arrangements with applicable members to meet the terms of the safe harbor for GPOs set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(j) and the discount safe harbor set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(h). Although full compliance with the provisions of a safe harbor ensures against prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. From time to time, HHS, through its Office of Inspector General, makes formal and informal inquiries, conducts investigations and audits the business practices of GPOs, including our GPO, the result of which could be new rules, regulations or in some cases, a formal enforcement action. 
To help ensure regulatory compliance with HHS rules and regulations, our members that report their costs to Medicare are required under the terms of the Premier Group Purchasing Policy to appropriately reflect all elements of value received in connection with our IPO on their cost reports. We are required to furnish applicable reports to such members setting forth the amount of such value, to assist their compliance with such cost reporting requirements. There can be no assurance that the HHS Office of Inspector General or the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, will concur that these actions satisfy their applicable rules and regulations. 
False Claims Act. Our business is also subject to numerous federal and state laws that forbid the submission or "causing the submission" of false or fraudulent information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement to Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs or private health plans. In particular, the False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits a person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by an officer, employee or agent of the United States. In addition, the FCA prohibits a person from knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to such a claim. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages, significant monetary penalties, and other collateral consequences including, potentially, exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. A claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA.
Privacy and Security Laws. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, contains substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information, referred to as "protected health information." The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity or a business associate (essentially, a third party engaged to assist a covered entity with enumerated operational and/or compliance functions) from using or disclosing protected health information unless the use or disclosure is validly authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and only if certain complex requirements are met. In addition to following these complex requirements, covered entities and business associates must also meet additional compliance obligations set forth in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. In addition, the HIPAA Security Rule establishes administrative, organizational, physical and technical safeguards to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by covered entities and business associates. The HIPAA Security Rule requirements are intended to mandate that covered entities and business associates regularly re-assess the adequacy of their safeguards in light of changing and evolving security risks. Finally, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires that covered entities and business associates, under certain circumstances, notify patients/beneficiaries, media outlets and HHS when there has been an improper use or disclosure of protected health information.
Our self-funded health benefit plan and our healthcare provider members (provided that these members engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions with health plans, which will be all or the vast majority) are directly regulated by HIPAA as "covered entities." Additionally, because most of our U.S. hospital members disclose protected health information to us so that we may use that information to provide certain data analytics, benchmarking, consulting or other operational and compliance services to these members, we are a "business associate" of those members. In these cases, in order to provide members with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires us to enter into "business associate agreements" with our covered entity members. Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:

(i) | as to how we will use and disclose the protected health information within certain allowable parameters established by HIPAA,


(ii) | that we will implement reasonable and appropriate administrative, organizational, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from impermissible use or disclosure,


(iii) | that we will enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information,


(iv) | that we will report breaches of unsecured protected health information, security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information, and


(v) | that we will assist the covered entity with certain of its duties under HIPAA.

18

With the enactment of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH Act, the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA were modified and expanded. The HITECH Act applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. Prior to this change, business associates had contractual obligations to covered entities but were not subject to direct enforcement by the federal government. In 2013, HHS released final rules implementing the HITECH Act changes to HIPAA. These amendments expanded the protection of protected health information by, among other things, imposing additional requirements on business associates, further restricting the disclosure of protected health information in certain cases when the disclosure is part of a remunerated transaction, and modifying the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, which has been in effect since September 2009, to create a rebuttable presumption that an improper use or disclosure of protected health information under certain circumstances requires notice to affected patients/beneficiaries, media outlets and HHS.
Transaction Requirements. HIPAA also mandates format, data content and provider identifier standards that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. Although our systems are fully capable of transmitting transactions that comply with these requirements, some payers and healthcare clearinghouses with which we conduct business may interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do or may require us to use legacy formats or include legacy identifiers as they make the transition to full compliance. In cases where payers or healthcare clearinghouses require conformity with their interpretations or require us to accommodate legacy transactions or identifiers as a condition of successful transactions, we attempt to comply with their requirements, but may be subject to enforcement actions as a result. In 2009, CMS published a final rule adopting updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets and changing the formats to be used for electronic transactions subject to the ICD-10 code sets, known as Version 5010. All healthcare providers are required to comply with Version 5010 and use the ICD-10 code sets.
Other Federal and State Laws. In addition to our obligations under HIPAA there are other federal laws that impose specific privacy and security obligations, above and beyond HIPAA, for certain types of health information and impose additional sanctions and penalties. These rules are not preempted by HIPAA. Most states have enacted patient and/or beneficiary confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, data security breach notification requirements, and special rules for so-called "sensitive" health information, such as mental health, genetic testing results, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, status. These state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them as well.
We are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other federal or state laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the associated costs of compliance. 
Antitrust Laws
The Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws are complex laws that prohibit contracts in restraint of trade or other activities that are designed to or that have the effect of reducing competition in the market. The federal antitrust laws promote fair competition in business and are intended to create a level playing field so that both small and large companies are able to compete in the market. In their 1996 Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Health Care, or the Healthcare Statements, the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, set forth guidelines specifically designed to help GPOs gauge whether a particular purchasing arrangement may raise antitrust concerns and established an antitrust safety zone for joint purchasing arrangements among healthcare providers. Under this antitrust safety zone, the DOJ and FTC will not challenge, except in extraordinary circumstances, joint purchasing arrangements among healthcare providers that meet two basic conditions: (i) the purchases made by the healthcare providers account for less than 35% of the total sales of the purchased product or service in the relevant market; and (ii) the cost of the products and services purchased jointly account for less than 20% of the total revenues from all products and services sold by each competing participant in the joint purchasing arrangement.
We have attempted to structure our contracts and pricing arrangements in accordance with the Healthcare Statements and believe that our GPO supplier contracts and pricing discount arrangements should not be found to violate the antitrust laws. No assurance can be given that enforcement authorities will agree with this assessment. In addition, private parties also may bring suit for alleged violations under the U.S. antitrust laws. From time to time, the group purchasing industry comes under review by Congress and other governmental bodies with respect to antitrust laws, the scope of which includes, among other things, the relationships between GPOs and their members, distributors, manufacturers and other suppliers, as well as the services performed and payments received in connection with GPO programs.
Congress, the DOJ, the FTC, the U.S. Senate or another state or federal entity could at any time open a new investigation of the group purchasing industry, or develop new rules, regulations or laws governing the industry, that could adversely impact our ability to negotiate pricing arrangements with suppliers, increase reporting and documentation requirements, or otherwise require us to modify our arrangements in a manner that adversely impacts our business. We may also face private or government lawsuits 
19

alleging violations arising from the concerns articulated by these governmental factors or alleging violations based solely on concerns of individual private parties.
Governmental Audits
Because we act as a GPO for healthcare providers that participate in governmental programs, our group purchasing services have in the past and may again in the future be subject to periodic surveys and audits by governmental entities or contractors for compliance with Medicare and Medicaid standards and requirements. We will continue to respond to these government reviews and audits but cannot predict what the outcome of any future audits may be or whether the results of any audits could significantly or negatively impact our business, our financial condition or results of operations.
Corporate Compliance Department
We execute and maintain a compliance and ethics program that is designed to assist us and our employees conduct operations and activities ethically with the highest level of integrity and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, if violations occur, to promote early detection and prompt resolution. These objectives are achieved through education, monitoring, disciplinary action and other remedial measures we believe to be appropriate. We provide all of our employees with education that has been developed to communicate our standards of conduct, compliance policies and procedures as well as policies for monitoring, reporting and responding to compliance issues. We also provide all of our employees with a third party toll-free number and Internet website address in order to report any compliance or privacy concerns. In addition, our Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer individually, and along with the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, helps oversee compliance and ethics matters across our business operations. 
Employees
As of June 30, 2019, we employed approximately 2,200 persons, approximately 40% of whom are based in our headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. None of our employees are working under a collective bargaining arrangement.
