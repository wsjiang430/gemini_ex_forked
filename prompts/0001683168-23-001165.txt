Overview
 
Aclarion is a healthcare technology company that leverages Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (“MRS”), and proprietary biomarkers to optimize clinical treatments. Aclarion’s technology addresses the $134.5B U.S. low back and neck pain market, which according to a 2020 JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) article is now the most costly healthcare condition in the United States. The Company is currently utilizing Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to assist in quality control processes that flag spectroscopy data indicative of a poor MRS study. The use of AI in this application is early in its development cycle and is expected to evolve with further research and development. The Company is capturing in databases both the raw spectroscopy data and the post-processed spectral data from every Nociscan completed in order to utilize this data as future training data to teach a machine learning algorithms to associate MRS data with clinical outcomes. The use of AI in this application is aspirational and we intend this type of AI research and development to be an ongoing process applied not only to the various treatment paths associated with back pain, such as conservative therapies, regenerative and cell therapies and surgical intervention, but also to potentially expand into other clinical explorations involving the diagnosis of brain, breast and prostate tumors.
 
The Company, which has limited sales to date, is addressing the chronic low back pain market by initially focusing on improving the outcomes of surgical interventions to treat chronic discogenic low back pain. In this initial application, Aclarion technology is intended to assist surgeons in determining the optimal surgical procedure for a patient undergoing surgery for pain isolated to their lumbar spine (the “lumbar spine” is comprised of the five (5) lower vertebrae, L-1 to L-5). Through clinical studies we intend to extend the application of our technology beyond surgical decisioning to help with managing large segments of low back pain patients from the point of initial MRI through to episode resolution. We believe this will expand the use of our technology to supporting treatment decisions for chronic low back pain patients undergoing conservative therapies such as physical therapy or biologic and cell therapies aimed at regenerating the lumbar discs. We plan to expand the application of our technology beyond the lumbar spine to address neck pain populations in addition to low back pain populations. To expand the application of our technology for use in neck pain populations, we will need to overcome technical changes associated with securing adequate MRS data from the cervical disc, which is significantly smaller than the lumbar disc, and there can be no assurance the Company will be able to overcome these challenges.
 
The core technology Aclarion employs is MR Spectroscopy. The patient experience when undergoing an MRS exam is exactly like that of a standard MRI, with the exception of an additional 3-5 minutes for each disc undergoing a spectroscopy exam. Whereas a standard MRI produces a signal that is converted into anatomical images, an MRS produces a signal that is converted into a waveform that identifies the chemical composition of tissues. Just like with standard MRIs, the data from spectroscopy is useless without technologies that can process the data. Aclarion has developed proprietary signal processing software that transforms spectroscopy data into clear biomarkers. These biomarkers, which are exclusively licensed from the Regents of University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”), are the key data inputs for our proprietary algorithms that, when applied, determine if an intervertebral disc is consistent with pain. Our patent portfolio includes 22 U.S. Patents, 17 Foreign Patents, 6 pending U.S. patent applications, and 7 pending Foreign patent applications, including patents and patent applications exclusively licensed from Regents of the University of California.
 
We believe one of the biggest issues driving the cost of treating low back and neck pain patients to the top of the list for healthcare spending is that there is no objective, cost effective and noninvasive diagnostics to reliably identify the source of a patient’s pain. We believe the poor surgical outcomes for chronic DLBP are largely due to difficulties in reliably and accurately diagnosing the specific spinal discs that are causing pain. The current primary diagnostic standard is the MRI, which is useful for showing abnormal structures and tissue dehydration, but, we believe, cannot reliably identify specific discs that are causing pain. To diagnose specific discs that are causing pain, a needle-based Provocation Discogram test (“PD Test”) has been developed. PD Tests have been shown to be highly accurate when performed properly. However, a PD Test is invasive, subjective, and unpleasant for the patient as the patient needs to be awake in order to tell the physician if the pain the physician is purposefully causing in the disc is the same as the pain the patient feels when they are experiencing a back pain episode. In addition, recent evidence has shown that the action of inserting a needle into a normal disc during a discogram procedure leads to an increased rate of degeneration in these previously normal discs. Based on the limitations and concerns of the PD Test, we believe there is a significant need for an objective, accurate, personalized, and noninvasive diagnostic test that can reliably determine if an individual disc is a pain generator. By providing physicians information about whether a disc has the chemical and structural makeup consistent with pain or not, we believe the treatment plan for each patient will lead to more efficient and targeted care that, will in turn, result in lower costs and healthier patient outcomes.

Aclarion has taken the first steps to demonstrate the potential use of our technology in helping to improve the outcome of surgical intervention for discogenic low back pain patients by publishing a clinical study in the European Spine Journal in April 2019. The study illustrated that when all discs identified as consistent with pain by our technology were included in a surgical treatment, 97% of the patients met the criteria for “clinical improvement”. This compared to only 54% of patients meeting the criteria for clinical improvement if a disc that our technology identified as consistent with pain, was not included in the surgical treatment.
 
The results of this clinical study led the CPT committee to approve four Category III codes for our technology in January 2021. The NIH also included our technology as one of the handful of technologies selected to participate in their $150 million Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program, an NIH translational, patient-centered effort to address the need for effective and personalized therapies for chronic low back pain. In 2022, the NIH subsequently selected our technology to be included in their prospective randomized follow-on study that resulted from BACPAC. This new study is called Biomarkers for the Evaluation of Spinal Treatments (BEST) and is designed to evaluate several technologies that provide data about a patient to see if these technologies can identify subgroups of chronic LBP patients that do better with one of four treatments being evaluated in the study.
 
Evolving science coupled with the understanding of degenerative painful discs has suggested that lumbar discs may become painful due to certain chemical changes, which changes cannot be identified using standard lumbar MRI imaging. However, an application of MRI scanners called Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy has been developed by manufacturers of MRI equipment. MRSs are different than MRIs. An MRI generates images of body structures, while an MRS analyzes the relative amounts of various chemicals in body tissues.
 
Aclarion has developed a software application called NOCISCAN® which uses the existing MRS capabilities of many commercially available scanners to non-invasively analyze the chemical makeup of intervertebral discs in the spine. The software post-processes the MRS exam data and detects the presence of chemical biomarkers that we, in conjunction with spine researchers at UCSF, have demonstrated to be associated with degenerative pain and structural integrity of the lumbar discs. After processing the MRS exam data, we send the ordering clinician a report that details how to interpret the results of the MRS exam. We believe these results help clinicians make quicker and more informed decisions about which lumbar discs are painful, and which are not. We believe the ordering clinician can use this information to determine the optimal treatment plan for an individual patient.
 
Because we believe that spectroscopy is not widely used for any clinical purposes today, there are practical limitations to the market opportunity that must be addressed. We believe the two biggest limitations may be the lack of deployment of spectroscopy software across the installed base of existing MRIs worldwide, and the fact that only certain MR scanner models are compatible with our technology. For compatible MRI sites that do not currently have spectroscopy software installed, the onetime cost of the software ranges from $25,000 to $50,000. Currently, our NOCISCAN platform is only compatible with certain MR scanner models provided by SIEMENS, of which there are an estimated 1,500 in the United States, and 4,320 worldwide. We plan to collaborate with other MRI scanner vendors, as well as SIEMENS, to establish compatibility with their respective scanners and MRS capabilities for use with our products. That may allow us to include discounted pricing on spectroscopy software for MRI sites interested in providing DLBP patients with the NOCISCAN offering.
 
The first application of Aclarion’s technology is focused on improving surgical decision making when surgical intervention is being contemplated for patients with low back pain. The Company’s first commercial product, which we have named “NOCISCAN”, utilizes our proprietary biomarkers and algorithms to provide surgeons with information about which intervertebral discs are determined to be consistent with generating pain, and which are not. We believe that surgeons can use this information to better plan their surgical treatments and improve outcomes in their patients. In a clinical study published in the European Spine Journal in April 2019 it was shown that in patients where all discs identified as painful by NOCISCAN were included in the surgical treatment that 97% of those patients met the criteria for significant clinical improvement. This compared to only 54% of surgical patients meeting the criteria for significant clinical improvement when discs identified as painful by NOCISCAN were omitted from the surgical treatment, or discs identified as not painful by NOCISCAN were included in the treatment. Some authors of this study had a financial relationship with Aclarion, who sponsored the study.
 
Based on the results of this clinical study, the Company believes that use of NOCISCAN could become the standard protocol for assisting in the treatment plan of patients with low back pain undergoing surgical intervention. Utilizing the results of our European Spine Journal Study, we applied to the American Medical Association for CPT codes to begin the process of securing insurance coverage to pay for NOCISCAN. On January 1, 2021, Category III CPT codes became effective. The Company is now executing its plan to commercialize NOCISCAN. See “Reimbursement” below.

The core technology underlying NOCISCAN is the use of MR spectroscopy to identify the chemical makeup of intervertebral discs with a focus on identifying specific proprietary biomarkers known to be correlated to pain and to the structural degradation of discs. We believe this technology, in combination with advanced machine learning and AI platforms, has the potential to not only become included in the standard of care for patients undergoing surgical intervention for low back pain, but to become a core data input for optimally managing entire segments of patients suffering from low back and neck pain.
 
Industry Overview
 
Low Back Pain
 
According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, low back pain (LBP) is among the top three causes for years lived with disability. A 2020 JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) article established the cost of low back and neck pain at $134.5B in the U.S, making it the most costly healthcare condition in the United States, surpassing cardiac disease, diabetes and cancer.
 
Low back pain (LBP) can be caused by many different problems and abnormalities along and around the spine, other than DLBP, including conditions such as spondylolisthesis or instability of the vertebral bodies, vertebral body fractures, facet pathologies, central canal and foraminal stenosis, disc herniations, pars fracture, congenital abnormalities and tumors. Many of the causes of low back pain are readily detected by standard MRI imaging of the spine, which reveals clear structural abnormalities, i.e., fractures and tumors. However, in many cases the source of the pain is not clear. As a result, the success rates of surgical care for LBP ranges from 41 to 57%, with 5-16% early complication and reoperation rates also reported.
 
We believe that poor surgical outcomes for discogenic LBP are largely due to difficulties in reliably and accurately diagnosing the specific spinal discs that are causing pain. The current primary diagnostic standard, lumbar MRI, is useful for showing abnormal structures and tissue dehydration, but, we believe, cannot reliably identify specific discs that are causing pain. To diagnose specific discs that are causing pain, a needle-based Provocation Discogram test (“PD Test”) has been developed. A PD Test has been shown to be highly accurate when performed properly. However, a PD Test is invasive, subjective and unpleasant for the patient, as the patient is required to be awake in order to tell the physician if the pain the physician is purposefully causing in the disc is the same as the pain the patient feels when they are experiencing a back pain episode. In addition, recent evidence has shown that the action of inserting a needle into a normal disc during PD Test, leads to an increased rate of degeneration in these previously normal discs.
 
Due to the current lack of uniform acceptance of a diagnostic platform to safely and reliably diagnose the specific discs that cause DLBP, patients with DLBP are faced with the options of surgical intervention with a risk of a poor surgical outcomes, or, non-surgical treatment with powerful pain killing drugs, such as opiates and synthetic opiates. Those patients who choose surgery and have a poor surgical outcome with no surgical alternatives will be faced with the possibility of enduring disabling, intractable pain, and often extended dangerous pain medication use.
 
Diagnostic Imaging
 
Diagnostic imaging involves the use of non-invasive procedures to generate representations of internal anatomy and function that can be recorded on film or digitized for display on a video monitor. Diagnostic imaging procedures facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, often minimizing the cost and amount of care for patients. Diagnostic imaging procedures include MRI, CT, PET, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, mammography, X-ray and fluoroscopy.
 
While X-ray remains the most commonly performed diagnostic imaging procedure, one of the fastest growing procedures is the MRI. The number of MRI scans performed annually in the United States continues to grow due to its wider acceptance by physicians and third party payers, an increasing number of applications for their use and a general increase in demand due to the aging population. MRI has long been a widely accepted diagnostic standard of care for spine and low back pain, including discogenic low back pain patients, which is the target medical condition for our diagnostic products.

Diagnostic Imaging Settings
 
Diagnostic imaging services are typically provided in one of the following settings:
 
Fixed-site, freestanding outpatient diagnostic facilities
 
These facilities range from single-modality to multi-modality facilities and are generally not owned by hospitals or clinics. These facilities depend upon physician referrals for their patients and generally (although not always) do not maintain dedicated, contractual relationships with hospitals or clinics. In fact, these facilities may compete with hospitals or clinics that have their own imaging systems to provide services to patients. These facilities bill third-party payers, such as managed care organizations, insurance companies, Medicare or Medicaid, and workers’ compensation providers.
Hospitals
 
Many hospitals provide both inpatient and outpatient diagnostic imaging services, typically on site or at a dedicated center located on or nearby the hospital campus. These can be owned and operated by the hospital and provide imaging services to inpatients as ordered or outpatients through physician referrals. The hospital normally bills third-party payors such as managed care organizations, insurance companies, Medicare or Medicaid, and workers’ compensation providers. We have entered into joint ventures with certain hospitals both provide and manage their diagnostic imaging services, allowing them to leverage our industry expertise.
Mobile Imaging
 
While many hospitals own or lease their own equipment, certain hospitals provide diagnostic imaging services by contracting with providers of mobile imaging services. Using specially designed trailers, mobile imaging service providers transport imaging equipment and provide services to hospitals and clinics on a part-time or full-time basis, thus allowing small to mid-size hospitals and clinics that do not have the patient demand to justify fixed on-site access to advanced diagnostic imaging technology. Diagnostic imaging providers contract directly with the hospital or clinic and are typically reimbursed directly by them. We do not provide mobile imaging services. The cloud-based software products and services we do provide, however, are compatible for use for post-processing data that may be acquired by certain MR scanners that are deployed in a mobile imaging setting and model.
Company History
 
Aclarion’s technology was originally invented, and initially tested, via successful proof of concept by Aclarion co-Founder and head of our Scientific Advisory Board, Jeffrey Lotz, PhD, at the University of California San Francisco (“UCSF”). Early research, which was published in a major peer-reviewed journal in 2005, was premised upon a growing suspicion and interest that discs may become painful due to chemical changes, in particular elevated acidity related to hypoxia, that are not tested using a standard MRI. With that theory in mind, Dr. Lotz’s initial study looked to identify chemical biomarkers for painful discs using MRS, which applies a pulsed magnetic field to tissues in order to vibrate the different chemicals in that tissue and generate a spectrum that allows for measuring those different chemicals based on their different peaks along that spectrum. NMR equipment was used to conduct MRS chemical analysis of painful discs that were surgically removed for DLBP fusion surgery versus normal, non-painful discs that were surgically removed from spinal deformity (i.e. scoliosis) patients for lumbar spine reconstruction. Those ex vivo 11T MRS spectral measurement results showed that all (n=9) of the painful discs were distinguished from all of the non-painful discs based on the highly repeatable (100%) differences in their ratios between lactic acid, a painful chemical resulting from hypoxia, and proteoglycan, a structural chemical of the disc that holds water for hydration. It was observed that with degenerative painful discs, proteoglycan reduces with the degeneration, and lactic acid elevates with the pain. Hence, the MRS-based test and identifiable structural and degenerative pain biomarkers were able to be identified.
 
This work became the subject of the first patent granted to the Regents of the University of California and exclusively licensed to Aclarion. Thereafter, a strategic collaboration with SIEMENS, a major MRI equipment manufacturer, was initiated and a clinical study, the Gornet Study, involving 73 surgical patients was published in the European Spine Journal, a major peer-reviewed publication (See “Clinical Evidence” below). Our NOCICALC and NOCOGRAM products were subsequently registered with the FDA, CE marked and launched in the US, EU, and UK markets through a customer pay model since insurance codes were not yet in existence.

In February 2020, NuVasive agreed to purchase $308,720 of convertible notes, convertible into Series B-1 preferred shares and in connection with such purchase, was issued a warrant to purchase 171,511 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $.18 per share.
 
In February 2020, NuVasive and the Company also entered into an amended and restated commission agreement (the “Commission Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay NuVasive a commission of 6% of certain revenues of the Company related to Aclarion’s Nociscan technology through December 31, 2023, and issued to NuVasive the right to receive the Company’s preferred shares subject to the terms of a $2 million “SAFE” (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). The SAFE provided that NuVasive would receive $2 million of capital stock if the Company would raise a minimum of $10.0 million of new capital on or before December 31, 2020, which was later extended to June 30, 2021. If the $10.0 million was not raised, the Company would issue to NuVasive 1,584,660 Series B-2 preferred shares. The $10.0 million was not raised and the Company issued 1,584,660 Series B-2 preferred shares to NuVasive in December 2021. In connection with the Commission Agreement, NuVasive agreed that: (i) NuVasive would cease to market the Company’s technology, (ii) NuVasive would reduce their Commission to 6%, and (iii) Commissions to NuVasive would terminate on December 31, 2023. In December 2021, NuVasive’s convertible notes were converted into Series B-3 preferred shares.
 
Products and Solutions
 
Aclarion has developed a software application called NOCISCAN®. The product uses the existing MRS capabilities of many commercially available scanners to non-invasively analyze the chemical makeup of intervertebral discs in the spine. The software post-processes the MRS exam data and detects the presence of chemical biomarkers that Aclarion, in conjunction with spine researchers at UCSF, have demonstrated to be associated with degenerative pain and structural integrity of the lumbar discs. After processing the MRS exam data, Aclarion sends the ordering clinician a report that details how to interpret the results of the MRS exam. We believe these results help clinicians make faster and more informed decisions about which lumbar discs are painful, and which are not. We believe the ordering clinician can then use this information to determine the optimal treatment plan for an individual patient.
 
NOCISCAN is entirely non-invasive and only briefly extends an otherwise standard MRI exam. The MRI scan is the most frequently used type of pulse sequence for operating Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) scanners. It uses a powerful magnet to apply a pulsed magnetic field to a patient, sensors to detect radio waves that emanate from the resonant vibrations of different chemicals in the body in response to that pulsed magnetic field and a computer to create detailed images of tissue structures in the patient based on those detected chemical signals. Because water and fat are the most prevalent chemicals in the body, standard MRI images are typically based on the different levels of water and fat between different tissues. MRS, however, is another type of pulse sequence that uses NMR scanners in a similar way as an MRI, but instead of using the chemical resonances to create an image, MRS creates a spectrum for a tissue with different peaks that represent many different chemicals, in addition to water and fat, in that tissue. The relative amounts of those chemicals can be calculated by measuring their respective spectral peaks. While MRS has been used previously for diagnosing certain cancers (e.g. brain, breast, prostate) by measuring unique chemical biomarkers for tumors, NOCISCAN uses MRS for measuring the relative levels of degenerative pain and structural integrity biomarkers in discs. The relative levels of degenerative pain and structural integrity biomarkers are derived through the use of proprietary post processing technologies.
 
The platform used to conduct a NOCISCAN involves: (i) an MRS exam of an intervertebral disc performed according to a proprietary protocol, (ii) a data transfer portal to securely transfer data from the MRS exam to Aclarion’s cloud based post-processer technology, (iii) post-processor technology that identifies biomarker peaks and leverages calculation tables that evaluate a number of ratios of biomarker peaks, where pain biomarkers are in the numerator and structural biomarkers are in the denominator, and (iv) a final diagnostic report called a Nocigram that identifies discs as painful or not.

(a)    NOCISCAN MRS Exam Protocol: We have developed a custom software protocol and technique for using commercially available MRS pulse sequences in scanning intervertebral discs which extends the time of a standard lumbar MRI exam by an average of about 30 minutes for 5 lumbar discs. The custom protocol is a proprietary series of settings and instructions for MRS to conduct the NOCISCAN exam to obtain optimal and reliable MRS data. This protocol is not a product sold by the Company. The software protocol was created by Aclarion for insertion within a pre-existing software file format and is downloaded onto the MRS by the MRS owner, for use within the MRS’s operating system environment. Currently, our software protocol is compatible with only certain MRS models and operating systems available from SIEMENS, as those SIEMENS models specifically provide for user-defined customizations available for running our custom pulse sequences on SIEMENS MRS equipment.
 
(b)     Data Transfer: Data is routinely transferred from MR scanners to externally hosted cloud post-processors in many settings and applications, with an existing market of products and protocols for doing so. Aclarion provides MR imaging providers two options for data transfer: (1) a licensed proprietary imaging data transfer platform provided by AMBRA® Healthcare, and (2) NOCIWEB®, a custom developed web-interface developed and offered by Aclarion.
 
(c)     The NOCISCAN Post-Processor Suite: This comprises the products that Aclarion currently markets and sells. The post-processor technology requires MRS exam data acquired only according to Aclarion’s proprietary MRS exam protocols described in (a) above. The NOCISCAN Post-Processor Suite comprises of two software products that interact with each other:
 

· | NOCICALC® receives the raw un-processed NOCISCAN MRS exam data and post-processes that raw data into final spectra, and performs various degenerative pain biomarker calculations from those spectra, for each disc examined. NOCICALC is Registered as a Class I Medical Device with the FDA. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NOCIGRAM® further processes the NOCICALC results into individual NOCISCORES, on a 0-10 scale, that represent the different relative levels of degenerative pain biomarkers the various discs examined in the patient. High/low NOCISCORE ranges are also correlated to painful (indicated as “NOCI+” result) versus non-painful (indicated as a “NOCI-result). The NOCISCORE scale was developed according to a reference PD TEST that was used as a standard control in a peer reviewed clinical development trial for our technology. The post-processed MRS results are shown in an intuitive NOCIGRAM report with reference to certain MRI images of the related patient’s lumbar spine. The NOCIGRAM report is provided to the physician to aide in the physician’s diagnosis and treatment planning. NOCIGRAM is commercially available in the United States as “Clinical Decision Support Software” under the 21st Century Cures Act, and as such is not considered a medical device nor regulated by the FDA.

Advantages over current technology and procedures
 
NOCISCAN provides new information to help doctors better diagnose which intervertebral discs may contribute to patients back pain and thereby assist in treatment planning and potentially improve patient outcomes.
 
More specifically, current standards of care for the diagnostic workup of LBP include lumbar X-Ray and MRI and less prevalently, needle-based provocative discography testing (PD Tests). While lumbar X-Ray and MRI can show various pathologic structural abnormalities and degeneration and can be helpful for diagnosing certain non-discogenic sources of pain, these techniques are unreliable for identifying painful discs in LBP patients. The PD TEST is another test that typically follows MRI for the purpose of identifying painful discs. PD Tests have been shown to be highly accurate when performed properly, however, a PD Test is invasive, subjective and unpleasant for the patient as the patient needs to be awake in order to tell the physician if the pain the physician is purposefully causing in the disc is the same as the pain the patient feels when they are experiencing a back pain episode. In addition, recent evidence has shown that the action of inserting a needle into a normal disc during a discogram procedure leads to an increased rate of degeneration in these previously normal discs. We believe NOCISCAN advantages include: (a) enhancing the ability and value of otherwise standard lumbar MRI exams to, for the first time, reliably identify chemically painful discs causing DLBP; and (b) providing a “Virtual Discogram™” as an entirely non-invasive, objectively quantitative, pain-free, non-significant risk, and more widely adoptable alternative to needle-based PD exams (which share none of those advantages).

NOCISCAN incorporates many patented technologies and features that we believe provide several technical advantages to the MRS field in general. Prior applications of MRS, e.g. for brain, prostate, or breast cancer diagnosis encountered technical challenges related to acquiring reliably robust spectra for making accurate quantitative chemical measurements. These technical challenges resulted in poor sensitivity and specificity for prior MRS products addressing clinical applications. The novel features and advantages provided in the NOCISCAN platform are designed to address the technical and diagnostic challenges of MRS in the past. Accordingly, we believe Aclarion improvements do not only propose benefits for disc MRS, but potentially for other MRS applications more broadly. Improvements in processing raw MRS data incorporated in Aclarion IP are summarized below:

a) | increased signal noise ratio or “SNR” for more reliably identifying and measuring chemical peaks - in particular, by averaging spectra from multiple acquisitions using (i) only strong acquired signals and filtering out weak ones (“frame editing”), and (ii) a “smart” form of frequency shift correction to align multiple acquisitions for “coherent” averaging; and 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--


b) | detecting spectral artifacts that might compromise the reliability of spectral peak measurements and related chemical measurements, and which can occasionally result from technical issues during MRS exams in the scanner (generally observed in <10% of discs), and then either: (i) correct for the artifact (e.g. patient motion artifact correction), or (ii) identify the compromised MRS acquisition as a technical failure and unable to perform reliable spectroscopic measurement (i.e., occasionally supplanting a risk for inaccurate diagnosis instead of a technical failure and indeterminate diagnostic result). 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Basing diagnostic results on relative, normalized comparisons of the differences between chemical biomarkers for multiple different disc tissues in the same patient vs. assigning diagnostic thresholds for chemical measurements that are empirically derived from a separate clinical trial patient population and are not patient specific. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Evaluating only multi-chemical “degenerative pain” biomarkers that use ratios between spectral peaks for chemicals associated with (i) pain and (ii) structural degeneration, thus providing for: (a) a two-fold and bi-directional sensitivity in the combined biomarker from both the ratio’s numerator (pain biomarker) and its denominator (structural degeneration biomarker), and (b) reduction of patient anatomy-dependent variables in the MRS data to thereby enhance the personalization of the data and increase the generalizability of the diagnostic algorithms across diverse populations. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Using multi-peak spectral ranges, representing multiple different painful acids, as a single pain biomarker used in the combined ratios for degenerative pain biomarkers (e.g. “LAAL” painful chemical biomarker range combining adjacent Lactic Acid and ALanine peaks, and “ALPA” combining Alanine, Lactic acid, and Propionic Acid peaks) – thereby removing the need for accurately differentiating each individual peak, and thus reducing the risk for inaccuracy in the spectral measurements and diagnostic interpretations.

Clinical Evidence
 
We have pursued a clinical study (the “Gornet Study”) to demonstrate the benefits of our technology to surgeons, imaging centers, third party payers, and patients. Without strong clinical data in support of our technology to improve clinical outcomes, the opportunity to secure new reimbursement codes and change existing treatment pathways would be limited.
 
In a clinical study sponsored by us, and authored by, among others, a spine surgeon who has a financial interest in the Company. and published in the European Spine Journal in April 2019, it was shown that 97% of the treated patients met the criteria for significant clinical improvement, where all discs identified as painful by NOCISCAN were included in the surgical treatment. This compared to 54% of surgical patients achieving clinically significant improvement when discs identified as painful by NOCISCAN were omitted from the surgical treatment, or discs identified as not painful by NOCISCAN were included in the treatment. Some authors of this study had a financial relationship with Aclarion, who sponsored the study.
 
This clinical study included 139 chronic low back pain patients who collectively underwent a NOCISCAN exam across 623 lumbar discs. Seventy-three patients underwent surgical intervention, consisting of fusion or disc replacement, and reached six months follow up. Clinical improvement post surgically was evaluated using the industry standard Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). ODI evaluates patient disability on a scale of 1-100 with a higher score indicating less impairment. VAS evaluates subjective pain on a scale of 1-10 with a lower score indicating less pain. Significant clinical improvement in the study was defined as a 15-point improvement in ODI and a 2-point improvement in VAS. NOCISCAN data was not used in surgical decision making.
 
Post-operatively, patients were separated into various groups for analysis. One group consisted of patients where the surgical intervention included every disc that was identified by NOCISCAN as painful. This group consisted of 36 patients with 26 undergoing a one-level surgical procedure and 10 undergoing a two-level surgical procedure. 97% (35 of 36) of the patients in this category met the criteria for significant clinical improvement. The one failure in this group did meet the VAS requirement and missed the ODI cutoff of 15 by only one point.

--

 

In another group consisting of 13 patients, a disc identified as painful by NOCISCAN was not included in the surgical intervention. In this group only 54% (7 of 13) of patients met the criteria for clinically significant improvement.
 
We believe the results of this study indicates that using NOCISCAN data to help determine the appropriate level for surgical intervention will significantly improve the outcomes for patients undergoing spine surgery for back pain. However, the Gornet Study was a single (relatively small) clinical study at a single clinical center sponsored by us, and authored by, among others, a spine surgeon who has a financial interest in the Company, and there can be no assurance that the results of such study accurately support our conclusions related to the market opportunity of our products.
 
Market Opportunity
 
The current NOCISCAN product addresses the $10B that is spent in the U.S. on spine fusion procedures annually. Our early clinical evidence points to a marked improvement in surgical outcomes when discs identified as painful by our technology are included in the surgical treatment. We believe this market is actionable now and a significant portion of the proceeds of our IPO will be directed towards commercializing this market opportunity.
 
As we continue our commercialization efforts, we plan to track patients through clinical registries in order to build on our early clinical evidence. We expect to use these registries to track NOCISCAN patients regardless of what treatment path they may follow. Through the date of this prospectus, NOCISCAN has only been evaluated in formal clinical studies for patients primarily undergoing surgical interventions for fusion or disc replacement. The Company plans on expanding clinical registries to capture patients undergoing surgical interventions for back pain that include all surgical interventions, not just fusion and disc replacement procedures. If we are able to correlate specific MRS findings to improved surgical outcomes for all spine surgeries, we believe this would expand the size of our market opportunity in the U.S. from what we believe is $10B, to an estimated $40B, inclusive of pre-surgical conservative therapy costs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing our products, regardless of the size of the estimated market.
 
Our ultimate objective for NOCISCAN is to address the entire low back and neck pain market which at $134.5B annually represents the largest amount of healthcare dollars spent to treat any disease. To address this market, our current algorithms will need to expand to include advanced machine learning techniques that incorporate multiple data inputs besides the chemical composition of discs. These additional inputs will all need to be correlated to clinical outcomes for treatments ranging from physical therapy to regenerative therapies, and surgical interventions. To further this process, we have been selected as a participant in a $150M NIH funded study (the NIH BACPAC Initiative”) focused on evaluating the most promising data inputs for predicting the optimal treatment path for back pain patients and in the NIH’s follow on BEST study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of using these data inputs for improving clinical results.
 
In addition to participation in external studies such as the NIH BACPAC and BEST initiatives, we expect to create our own internal data by adding patients undergoing conservative and regenerative treatment plans to our clinical registries correlating NOCISCAN results to outcomes in order to utilize AI to associate spectroscopy signals with the optimal treatment pathway. If we are successful in demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of these associations, we intend to expand our market opportunity to the management of entire segments of low back and neck pain patients, thereby, we believe, increasing the size of our addressable market. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing our products, regardless of the size of the estimated market.
 
Although we believe that we are addressing a large U.S. and European market, there are practical limitations to the market opportunity that must be overcome by us. We believe the two biggest limitations are the lack of deployment of spectroscopy software across the install base of existing MRI’s worldwide and the fact that only certain MR scanner models are compatible with our technology. For compatible MRI machines, that do not have spectroscopy hardware and software installed, the onetime cost of the hardware and software ranges from $25,000 to $50,000. Currently, our NOCISCAN platform is only compatible with certain MR scanner models provided by SIEMENS, of which there are an estimated 1,500 in the United States, and 4,320 worldwide. We plan to collaborate with other MRI scanner vendors to establish compatibility of their respective scanners and MRS capabilities for use with our products, to include discounted pricing on spectroscopy software for MRI sites interested in providing DLBP patients with the NOCISCAN offering.

Plan of Operation and Growth Strategies
 
Our primary near-term growth strategy is to secure payer contracts to cover our Category III CPT codes. We believe that with favorable payer coverage decisions comes the opportunity to more efficiently market to spine surgeons and imaging centers to adopt our technology.
 
The Company is currently generating the vast majority of its revenue directly from patients paying out of pocket. With the introduction of Category III CPT codes and the proceeds of our IPO, the Company is transitioning to full commercial operations.
 
In order to effectively commercialize, the initial plan is to gain the support of up to 10 leading spine surgeons who believe Nociscan technology will help them with surgical decisioning in their practices. The Company has announced 7 of the 10 KOL surgeons to date and has verbal commitments to fill the remaining three KOL targets. Key Opinion Leader (KOL) surgeons are leaders in their field and will be assisting the Company in generating important clinical data in support of Nociscan and using that data to help the Company in discussions with payers to secure positive payment decisions for our Category III CPT codes.
 
Based primarily on our KOL surgeons and the strength of physician engagement in markets, the Company is prioritizing the following markets:
 

1. | NYC Metropolitan Area 
---+------------------------------
2. | San Francisco, CA 
3. | Chicago, IL 
4. | Phoenix, AZ 
5. | Miami, FL 
6. | Denver & Colorado Springs, CO
7. | Detroit, MI 
8. | Indianapolis 

 
Once a positive local payment decision is secured in a geographical area, we intend to place a market manager and a team of business development professionals into each market to focus on expanding physician support and securing favorable coverage decisions from additional payers in the market. The objective in each market is to expand the provider network to include additional imaging centers and surgeons so there is increasing geographical coverage. We believe increasing our footprint in each market will grow volume and revenue through increased pressure on payers to expand positive coverage decisions across all of the varied plans associated with each payer.
 
We believe the following strategies will contribute to growth in the prescription and use of NOCISCAN.
 

· | Enhance our multi-tiered sales/marketing/branding campaign targeted at (i) referring physicians, (ii) MR imaging providers, (iii) DLBP patients, (iv) spine implant equipment suppliers, (v) injectable biologics and cell therapy providers, (vi) MR scanner vendors, (vii) third party payors, and (viii) employers, all to grow awareness and demand for NOCISCAN; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase third party payer reimbursement coverage via reimbursement code utilization, payer negotiations, growing clinical evidence dossier via published registry studies and Randomized Control Trials (“RCT”), and converting temporary Category III CPT codes into permanent CPT Category I codes see “Third Party Reimbursement ” below; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand MR scanner compatibility to additional scanner models, including within the Siemens product lines and other manufacturers/vendors; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand into international markets;
--+-----------------------------------

--


· | Evolve the adaptations and positioning of our products to support new emerging technologies, and clinical trials, in particular for injectable biologic and cell therapies; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to conduct clinical trials, and publish clinical trial results in peer-reviewed journals in relevant fields to our business (e.g. MR/radiology, spine, and pain); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to engage and expand Key Opinion Leader (“KOL”) advisory boards and specialty medical society support for supporting and driving awareness of our products and services to wider audiences of potential customers and other stakeholders; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue additional applications of our technology, including other regions of the spine (e.g., thoracic, cervical), areas of the anatomy outside of the spine, and integrative use of our diagnostic platform with other diagnostic platforms and tests to potentially improve the management and outcomes of populations of low back and neck pain patients.

Strategic Relationships
 
Siemens
 
The NOCISCAN product suite is currently compatible for use only with certain MR scanner models and configurations provided by SIEMENS. We are not subject to any exclusivity agreement or obligations with SIEMENS, nor do we have any fee sharing, royalty, or other exchange of moneys or payments between us and Siemens. The nexus for our focused relationship with Siemens resulted from our determination that Siemens scanner models were optimally positioned to support our product. We have had a collaborative relationship with Siemens since 2011.
 
On May 2, 2012, following a prior period of informal collaboration, we entered a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with SIEMENS, under which SIEMENS agreed to support Aclarion’s research and development of what later became the NOCISCAN product suite for compatible use with SIEMENS scanners. The MOU included the development of certain custom features and technical support that SIEMENS would make available to support the development effort by Aclarion. The relationship was non-exclusive. The MOU was replaced by a Strategic Collaboration Agreement for Phased Commercialization of the SIEMENS-compatible NOCISCAN Product of Aclarion, Inc. (the “SIEMENS Agreement”) that we entered into with SIEMENS Healthcare GmbH on December 31, 2017. This agreement comprised a collaboration to identify, onboard and provide technical support for the SIEMENS-compatible NOCISCAN platform with early commercial users in the European Union, including a free trial period for those initial commercial users to activate and use the SIEMENS SVS pulse sequence option package that is required to be purchased by our customers in order to perform disc MRS according to the specifications for compatible use with our products. The SIEMENS Agreement also provided for plans for global joint marketing, potential business model/fee agreement and a potential integration of the NOCISCAN product suite into the SIEMENS Next Generation Frontier App Store model. While these plans have not yet been realized, the agreement still remains in effect through automatic extensions and we are in on-going dialogue and negotiations toward some, or possibly all, of these objectives. The Siemens Agreement is terminable.at any time by either party if such party is of the opinion that the goals of the Collaborative Agreement cannot be achieved for technical, economic and/or clinical reasons. If Siemens were to terminate its relationship with the Company, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, there can be no assurance that there will be any joint marketing or that future financial arrangements between us and SIEMENs will be established, and even if established, that such agreements will be successful or profitable.

RadNet
 
Two of the Company’s imaging centers that are fully operational to perform NOCISCAN’s are owned by RadNet, Inc., (“RadNet”) a leading provider of outpatient imaging centers in the United States. RadNet currently own 353 outpatient imaging centers across seven states. Larry Tannenbaum is one of our former board members and leads the radiology section of our Medical Advisory Board. The New York/New Jersey area is one of our top targets for early commercialization post IPO and we expect to leverage RadNet’s extensive relationship with commercial payers to secure introductions that we believe will lead to early coverage decisions from payers in support of our growth plans. Although we have ambitions to grow the RadNet relationship, the current arrangement is limited to the flow of revenue between Aclarion and RadNet for the performance of an MRS exam by RadNet and the subsequent generation of a Nociscan report by Aclarion.
 
Reimbursement 
 
Current Procedural Terminology or “CPT” codes are developed by the American Medical Association (“AMA”) to describe a wide range of health care services provided by physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These codes are utilized to communicate with: other physicians, hospitals, and insurers for claims processing. There are three categories of CPT Codes: Category I, Category II, and Category III (also often referred to interchangeably as “Levels”):

· | Category I CPT codes are used for reporting devices and drugs (including vaccines) required for the performance of a service or procedure, services or procedures performed by physicians and other health care providers, services or procedures performed intended for clinical use, services or procedures performed according to current medical practice, and services or procedures that meet CPT requirements. These codes are billable for reimbursement. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Category II CPT Codes are used for reporting performance measures reducing the necessity for chart review and medical records abstraction. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Category III CPT codes are used for reporting emerging technology in a number of capacities including services or procedures recently performed on humans, clinical trials and etc. These codes are temporary codes and must be accepted for placement in Level I by the CPT committee within five years, be renewed for another five more years, or be removed from the book. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our NOCISCAN product suite was initially commercialized without existing CPT codes or other pathways for seeking reimbursement coverage from third party payers. Accordingly, to date, the commercial uses of our products have been principally paid for directly by patients or their spine surgery care provider. The first third party payer reimbursement occurred in May 2021 via the payment of a Workman’s Compensation claim in Colorado.
 
Effective January 1, 2021, a previously retired Category I CPT Code 76390 for MR Spectroscopy was reinstated and reactivated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). This resulted from our own direct efforts with CMS in hopes of achieving this result. In addition, also effective January 1, 2021, the AMA approved four new Category III CPT Codes for performing MRS exams specifically on intervertebral discs. More specifically, these codes were assigned respectively to: (i) determine and localize discogenic pain via SVS (0609T), (ii) transmit the MRS derived biomarker data for software analysis (0610T), (iii) post-process the biomarker data for algorithmic analysis to determine relative chemical differences between discs (0611T), and (iv) interpret and report those results. Ambulatory Payment Classification (“APC”) pricing assignments were also made by CMS for three of these Level 1 T-codes, while the fourth (0612T) was not priced and left for us, or interpreting doctors, to negotiate payment pricing amounts with Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) and third-party payers. The creation, activation, and APC pricing assignment of these four new Level 3 codes was also the result of our Company directly pursuing and negotiating with the AMA toward these interim objectives. We intend to further explore APC assignments such as a New Technology APC to ensure our NOCISCAN product suite is assigned an APC that is appropriate in terms of clinical characteristics and resource costs.

The table below further explains these four new Level III CPT Codes:
 

CPT Code | Description 
-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0609T | MRS, determination and localization of discogenic pain (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar); acquisition of single voxel data, per disc, in ≥3 discs 
0610T | MRS, determination and localization of discogenic pain (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar); transmit biomarker data for software analysis 
0611T | MRS, determination and localization of discogenic pain (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar); postprocessing for algorithmic analysis of biomarker data for determination of relative chemical differences between discs 
0612T | MRS, determination and localization of discogenic pain (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar); interpretation and report 

 
Due to a lack of operating capital, we have not yet begun to seek reimbursement coverage or promote or suggest our customers use these codes. However, we plan to use the proceeds of our IPO to hire the personnel and expend our financial resources do so. The Category III Codes become more valuable and useful upon being converted into Level I, when widespread reimbursement coverage is expected to be achievable. We plan to support conversion of codes from Category III to Category I by advancing multiple clinical studies and related peer-reviewed clinical publications intended to further support improved patient outcomes (such as success rates following DLBP surgeries), and various economic advantages to be achieved by incorporating the use of our NOCISCAN platform into the DLBP patient’s healthcare journey. However, there can be no assurance that the Category III codes will be converted and replaced with corresponding Level I Codes, and if there is a delay in the conversion of the Codes to Level 1 or there is ultimately no conversion of Codes to Level I, our business will be materially adversely affected. Further, even if the Codes are converted to Level 1, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in increasing the use of our technology by patients and health care professionals.
 
Intellectual Property - Licenses, Patents and Trademarks
 
We rely on a combination of licenses, patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology. We seek to protect our technology and any potential future technology related to our NOCISCAN platform through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover current and future technology, their methods of use and processes, and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and foreign patent protection which includes, in addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, typically filing counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, India and South Africa.
 
On December 9, 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with the Regents of the University of California for certain inventions, generally characterized as systems, materials, and methods to localize and evaluate pain and degenerative properties of tissue, molecular markers that differentiate painful from non-painful discs; and MR Spectroscopy System and Method for diagnosing painful and non-painful intervertebral discs (collectively the “Invention”). 
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to the Invention, including certain patent rights related to the patents and technology the Company uses. Under the agreement, we agreed to pay a royalty of 4% of net sales of the licensed products. Additionally, we agreed to pay a minimum annual royalty fee starting on the third anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, which escalates each anniversary and is currently $50,000. UCSF has the right to terminate the agreement upon advanced notice in the event of a default by us. The agreement will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of the last of the licensed patents. The U.S. patents subject to the agreement expire between 2026 and 2029, without considering any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.

As of December 31, 2022, our intellectual property portfolio has 22 issued patent and 6 pending patent applications in the U.S., and 17 patent grants and 7 pending patent applications outside the United States. The overall patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications that are (i) assigned exclusively to the Company, (ii) assigned exclusively to the Regents of the University of California but exclusively licensed to the Company, and (iii) assigned to both the Company and the Regents of the University of California (also exclusively licensed to the Company). Many of these patents relate to, inventions involved in, the Company’s first product, the NOCISCAN product suite for post-processing disc MRS exam data. Others relate to potential enhancements of the NOCISCAN disc MRS exam (as conducted at the MR scanner) and also other alternative diagnostic approaches (e.g. molecular imaging and gene expression testing). Our portfolio of patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between January 30, 2026 and June 16, 2037 in the U.S., in each case without considering any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
 
Our intellectual property portfolio includes four patent families (each reflecting multiple families, if based on different original applications), that relate to our NOCISCAN technology and/or to other potential future pipeline products.
 
The first patent family is directed to inventions for signal processing techniques to include leveraging artificial intelligence technologies for improving the quality, reliability, and accuracy of MRS-based chemical biomarker measurements and related diagnostic interpretations. Many of these patented inventions are included in our NOCICALC product under the NOCISCAN Suite and cover uses specifically for disc MRS, and for MRS in any other tissues. This first family includes 8 issued patents and 1 pending patent application assigned to the Company in the US, and 3 issued patents and 1 pending patent application outside the U.S. (Europe and Australia). All of these are assigned to the Company. The U.S. granted patents and pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between October 14, 2029 and March 15, 2033, without considering any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
 
The second patent family relates to inventions for novel diagnostic systems and methods for providing diagnostically useful information based on MRS-based chemical biomarkers. Many of these patented inventions are incorporated in our NOCIGRAM product and related diagnostic report under the NOCISCAN Suite and relate to uses specifically for discogenic pain, conditions related to discs more generally, and more broadly any degenerative pain-related diagnosis in any tissue. This family includes patents relating to diagnosing degenerative painful discs (and other tissues) using the primary degenerative pain biomarkers evaluated by our NOCIGRAM product. The second patent family includes 6 issued patents and 3 pending patent applications in the US, and 9 patent grants and 6 pending patent applications outside the U.S. (Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, India, South Africa). These are either assigned to the Regents of the University of California or assigned to both the Regents of the University of California and the Company, in all cases with the UC’s rights exclusively licensed to the Company. The U.S. granted patents and pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between January 30, 2026 and June 16, 2037, without considering any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
 
Our third patent family relates to inventions that enhance the efficiency and reliability of certain aspects related to conducting MRS exams at the MR scanner. This includes enhancing the efficiency and quality of NOCISCAN disc MRS exams and other applications of MRS in general. These patented inventions are not currently incorporated into our commercial products but are in the research and development phase for potential pipeline products. This third patent family includes 3 issued US patents that are expected to expire on November 23, 2031, without considering any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. These patents are all assigned to the Company. This patent family also includes a pending U.S. patent application that relates to the use of Artificial Intelligence for enhancing MRS exams, which is in the research and development phase for potential pipeline products.
 
Our fourth patent family relates to inventions for other novel diagnostic systems and methods that represent potential future pipeline products, or otherwise provide potential exclusionary rights against related potential competitive threats. This includes patents related to discogenic pain diagnosis using molecular imaging and/or gene expression testing. The fourth patent family includes 4 issued patents and 1 pending patent application in the US, and 5 patent grants outside the U.S. (Europe, Canada, China). These patents are assigned to the Regents of the University of California and exclusively licensed to the Company (and in certain aspects, co-exclusively licensed under which the Company has exclusive rights to diagnostic aspects and another third-party licensee has limited exclusive rights to only certain treatment aspects). The U.S. granted patents and pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between September 21, 2026 and May 29, 2029, without considering any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future. We cannot be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.
 
We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategies to fortify our position. We file additional patent applications when our intellectual property strategy warrants such filings. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent that we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that relate to our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to our intellectual property, we cannot provide any assurance that any of our current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents in any particular jurisdiction, or that any of our current or future issued patents will effectively protect any of our tests or technology from infringement or prevent others from commercializing infringing tests or technology. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our tests or technology.
 
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions and technology, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, some elements of our analytics techniques and processes, computational-biological algorithms and related processes and software are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, advisors and consultants, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. For further discussion of the risks relating to intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk factors — Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”

Research and Development
 
Research and Development (“R&D”) activities at Aclarion primarily explore the use of AI, our post-processing technologies and clinical registry data to expand the use of our technology.
 
The Company is researching the application of AI and machine learning platforms to analyze both the raw spectroscopy data and the post-processed signal to evaluate whether AI platforms can more efficiently and more effectively associate MRS data with clinical outcomes. We expect this type of AI research and development to be an ongoing process applied not only to the various treatment paths associated with back pain, i.e., conservative therapies, regenerative and cell therapies and surgical intervention, but to potentially expand into other clinical explorations involving the diagnosis of brain, breast and prostate tumors.
 
Clinical research at Aclarion includes the building of clinical registries that provide the data inputs required to train the AI models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our technology for surgical decisioning as well as extend the use of our technology for potentially optimizing the treatment of neck and low back pain through other interventions.
 
Clinical registries track the MRS results for each disc being evaluated and correlates the MRS signature of the disc to patient specific data such as MRI imaging, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analog Scores (VAS). These methods are proven tools to assess low back pain, clinical treatments performed and to identify conservative therapies such as physical therapy and chiropractic intervention, regenerative and cell therapies or surgical interventions. By tracking specific treatments applied to each patient over time and correlating the effectiveness of those treatments to the MRS data of each disc, we expect to create a large repository of clinical data that can be used to train advanced machine learning algorithms that correlate MRS signatures from specific discs to improved outcomes from conservative and regenerative therapies.
 
Government Regulation
 
United States FDA.
 
In the United States, the FDA has broad regulatory powers with respect to pre-clinical and clinical testing of new medical devices and the designing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, federal law and FDA regulations require that all new or significantly modified medical devices introduced into the market be preceded either by a pre-market notification clearance order under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), or an approved Denovo or pre-market approval (PMA) application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements, and subject only to registration requirements (which the FDA does not typically review, thus determined and submitted solely by the applicant product owner).
 
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls as deemed necessary by the FDA, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the product for which clearance has been sought is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA had not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications. To be substantially equivalent, the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.

After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of, and clear or deny, a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a De Novo or PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a De Novo or PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a De Novo or PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process.
 
In the event a device might be considered Class III due to lack of an equivalent predicate device, but which does not pose a significant risk to patients, it may be ‘down-classified’ to a relatively newer De Novo pathway for pre-market notification review and approval, which typically involves burdens and review cycle times between what are typical for 510(k) and PMA pathways. In addition to the above classifications and related FDA regulatory pathways in the United States, certain technologies that were previously considered medical devices have recently been reclassified and not considered a medical device, and thus not regulated by the FDA. On December 13, 2016 the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was signed into law (Public Law 114-255, 130 STAT. 1033), and was designed to help accelerate medical product development and bring new innovations and advances to patients who need them faster and more efficiently. Section 3060 of the Cures Act was created as an amendment to section 520 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), which addressed how medical devices are defined. This outlined software functions that would be exempt from FDA regulation, such as those used for administrative purposes, encouraging a healthy lifestyle, electronic health records, clinical laboratory test results and related information, and clinical decision tools.
 
In the United States, the NOCISCAN product suite is only partially regulated as a medical device by the FDA. The NOCICALC product is considered a Class I “exempt” medical device and is registered as such with the FDA under product Classification “Calculator/Data Processing Module, for Clinical Use,” Product Code “JQP,” Regulation Number 862.2100, and Registration Number 3015426626.
 
The process to determine whether a product can be considered a Class I “exempt” medical device consists of self-determining whether the product is adequately described by one of the existing categories classified by the FDA. In conjunction with our regulatory consultants, we determined that the product Classification “Calculator/Data Processing Module, for Clinical Use,” adequately described our NOCICALC product.
 
In contrast, we believe the NOCIGRAM product is considered Clinical Decision Support software (CDS) under the 21st Century Cures Act and not a medical device. As such, we believe NOCIGRAM is not regulated by the FDA. Our conclusion that NOCISCAN would be considered Clinical Decision Support software (“CDS”), which under the 21st Century Cures Act’ is not a device and therefore exempted from medical device regulation,” is based upon the following analysis:

Under the Cures Act provision, a software product is not considered a device if it meets the following four elements:
 

· | "[Not] intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system;" 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | "[I]ntended ... for the purpose of... displaying, analyzing, or printing medical information about a patient or other medical information (such as peer-reviewed clinical studies and clinical practice guidelines);" 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | "[I]ntended ... for the purpose of... supporting or providing recommendations to a health care professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition;" and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | "[I]ntended ... for the purpose of... enabling such health care professional to independently review the basis for such recommendations that such software presents so that it is not the intent that such health care professional rely primarily on any of such recommendations to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual patient."4 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since December 13, 2016, the FDA has issued draft guidance which provides further insight into the interpretation of the above four elements. The draft guidance, entitled “Clinical and Patient Decision Support Software” (Dec. 2017) (“Draft Guidance”), reviews section 520(o)(l)(E) of the FDC Act and provides additional clarity on each element.
 
With respect to the last element listed above, the Draft Guidance elaborates on what is meant by allowing health professionals to "independently" review the basis for recommendations such that the CDS software is not intended to be "primarily" relied upon in a diagnosis or treatment decision. To that end, according to the Draft Guidance, the user must be told: "(I) The purpose or intended use of the software function; (2) The intended user (e.g., ultrasound technicians, vascular surgeons); (3) The inputs used to generate the recommendation (e.g., patient age and gender); and (4) The rationale or support for the recommendation.
 
As described above, FDA will not regulate software that meets the four requirements in the Cures Act as a medical device. Although there are some ambiguities as to the meaning of the relevant statutory terms, we believe NOCIGRAM meets all four of these requirements.
 
First, the NOCIGRAM is not intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system. Rather, it receives information from the NOCICALC, which separately performs such operations and produces a table of calculated disc chemistry ratio values for each disc examined. It is this table that the NOCIGRAM references in performing its analysis.
 
Second, NOCIGRAM is intended for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, or printing medical information about a patient or other medical information. The NOCISCORE Table and graphical plots provide medical information about the patient and analyze the data into classifications.
 
Third, NOCIGRAM is intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to a health care professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition. The information generated by the product is intended to support recommendations on how to manage patients presenting with low back pain that may be discogenic in nature. It does this by providing additional disc chemistry-based information to be considered by the physician in combination with other available patient information.

The fourth element of the statute is also met by NOCIGRAM, although the requirements for this element are more involved than the other three elements. This element requires a means for the health care professional to independently review the basis for any recommendation to prevent primary reliance on the software. In its recent Draft Guidance, FDA provides four elements that can be used to determine whether the CDS software allows for independent review: whether it explains (1) the purpose or intended use; (2) the intended user; (3) the inputs used to generate the recommendation; and (4) the rationale for the recommendation.
 
The NOCIGRAM explains the purpose of the intended use. It instructs the user that it is intended to provide analyses of chemical ratio information obtained from the NOCICALC product, which was separately derived from data via an MRS device, for the purpose of supporting recommendations about diagnosing and/or treating patients with certain back conditions. This information is explained in the product labeling. The product labeling also explicitly states that the intended user is a professional medical healthcare provider trained and skilled in diagnosing and recommending treatment options for low back pain and related lumbar spine disorders. Thus, both the first and second elements set forth in the Draft Guidance are satisfied.
 
As to the third element, the inputs used to generate any calculations for the health care professional consist of the chemical ratio information obtained from the NOCICALC device, and also the adjustment and analysis factors (e.g. weighting and thresholding/ranges) for analyzing that disc chemistry data. The labeling for NOCIGRAM will describe the NOCICALC outputs as the source disc chemistry data, and will also reference the published clinical trial results (i.e. correlations to discogram results) and related adjustment and analysis factors. This satisfies the third element.
 
The fourth element requires that the health care professional is able to independently review the rationale for the CDS software recommendation. FDA's Draft Guidance indicates that the sources supporting a recommendation should, among other things, be publicly available. Tracking the statute, FDA suggests that clinical practice guidelines and published literature would fit this description. The Company intends to publish the various factors (i.e. weighting and thresholds) applied to adjusting and analyzing the various input chemical ratios, and the correlative analysis to the PD reference test (as well as certain related treatment outcomes), in medical literature in marketing NOCIGRAM. The user is informed of the medical literature in the instructions for use of NOCIGRAM.
 
Moreover, the physician-user will have three means to independently verify the results of the NOCIGRAM. First, the user can manually input the adjustment factors and thresholding of the ratios as custom inputs for the NOCICALC product to derive the same custom output results from NOCICALC as those results provided by NOCIGRAM. Second, the user can independently (apart from NOCICALC) perform these same factor-adjusted and threshold classifier calculations based on the values obtained from NOCICALC using the methods described in publicly available literature. Third, the user can further verify the NOCI+/- results of the NOCIGRAM, which are correlated to discogram as a reference test based on clinical trial data, by conducting a discogram on the same discs in the patient. This will either confirm or disprove the correlation of NOCI+/ - to discogram results in those particular discs in that specific patient. These three verification options sufficiently address the issue of a proprietary database or algorithm that is essentially a "black box" to users, creating primary reliance on the CDS software rather than aiding informed decision making.


However, although we believe the above analysis is reasonable, whenever a company self classifies, there is a risk that FDA could disagree with the classification. Accordingly, in that context, it is possible that FDA could potentially disagree that the NOCIGRAM falls under the CDS software exemption to the definition of a device and there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our conclusion and in the event the FDA does not agree, our business would be severely negatively impacted.

FDA clearance or approval, when granted, may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed, and such product approvals, once granted, may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing. Manufacturers of FDA-regulated products are subject to pervasive and continuing post-approval governmental regulation, including, but not limited to: (i) the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution, (ii) the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, validation, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process, (iii) labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements, (iv) advertising and promotion requirements, (v) restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device, (vi) PMA annual reporting requirements, (vii) the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses, (viii) the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur, (ix) medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; an order of repair, replacement or refund, (x) device tracking requirements, and (xi) post-approval study and post-market surveillance requirements. The FDA has also established a Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) system that was phased in over a period of years. The UDI system requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices distributed in the United States with unique device identifiers.
 
The FDA recently finalized its guidance for managing post-market cybersecurity for connected medical devices. This guidance places additional expectations on our technology to build in cybersecurity controls when we design and develop our devices to assure safe performance in the face of cyber threats. It is also incumbent on us to monitor third party software for new vulnerabilities and verify and validate any software updates or patches meant to address vulnerabilities.
 
Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement.
 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness therapies, technology assessments and managed care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States, Europe and Asia. As a result of these changes, the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. In addition, because there is generally no separate reimbursement from third-party payers to our customers for many of our products, the additional costs associated with the use of our products can impact the profit margin of our customers. Accordingly, these various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over healthcare products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies.
 
Healthcare cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical devices to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power, and this trend is expected to continue. The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation, partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex and tend to involve more long-term contracts than in the past. These larger customers, due to their enhanced purchasing power, may attempt to increase the pressure on product pricing.

Significant healthcare reforms have had an impact on medical device manufacturer and hospital revenues. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending and improve healthcare quality. Many states have also adopted or are considering changes in healthcare policies, in part due to state budgetary pressures. Ongoing uncertainty regarding implementation of certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act makes it difficult to predict the impact the Affordable Care Act or state law proposals may have on our business.
 
Other Healthcare Laws. 
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, data privacy and security laws, anti-kickback and false claims laws, and transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 
As a participant in the healthcare industry, we are subject to extensive regulations protecting the privacy and security of patient health information that we receive, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), which was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Among other things, these regulations impose extensive requirements for maintaining the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information.” The HIPAA privacy regulations do not preempt state laws and regulations relating to personal information that may also apply to us. Our failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to civil and criminal sanctions.
 
The HIPAA provisions also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Further, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. Government. Medical device manufacturers have been held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing customers with inaccurate billing or coding information.
 
These laws impact the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with potential users of our technology. They particularly impact how we structure our marketing, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting, research grants and other service arrangements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Additionally, there has been a trend towards increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires that certain device manufacturers track and report to the government information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
 
We are subject to similar laws in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, within the EU, the control of unlawful marketing activities is a matter of national law in each of the member states. The member states of the EU closely monitor perceived unlawful marketing activity by companies. We could face civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions if any member state determines that we have breached our obligations under its national laws. Industry associations also closely monitor the activities of member companies. If these organizations or authorities name us as having breached our obligations under their regulations, rules or standards, our reputation would suffer and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
Other Foreign Healthcare Regulations 
 
We are also subject to regulation in the foreign countries in which we manufacture and market our products. For example, the commercialization of certain products, including certain medical devices, in the EU is regulated under a system that presently requires all such products sold in the EU to bear the CE mark—an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards.
 
The International Medical Device Regulators Forum has implemented a global approach to auditing manufacturers of medical devices. This audit system, called the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”), provides for an annual audit of a medical device manufacturer by a certified body on behalf of various regulatory authorities. Current authorities participating in MDSAP include the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, Brazil’s Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria, Health Canada, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency and the FDA. It is expected that more regulatory authorities will participate in MDSAP in the future.
 
We, and other medical device manufacturers, are currently adjusting to major changes in the EU’s decades-old regulatory framework which governs market access to the EU. The Medical Devices Regulation (“MDR”) went into effect on May 26, 2021 and replaces the EU’s prior Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC).
 
Our NOCISCAN product suite is subject to these EU regulations, and is CE Marked via self-certification as a Class I medical device. However, this was secured prior to enactment of the MDR. Under the MDR, we expect to be considered a Class II medical device and subject to stricter requirements for pre-market review and certification for CE Marking by a Notified Body, including with respect to clinical data that must be submitted in support of our claimed indications and labeling. However, manufacturers of certain classes of currently approved medical devices will have a transition time to meet certain aspects of the new requirements under the MDR. A grace period until May 2024 is provided for Class I medical devices that were self-certified for CE Marking prior to the MDR conversion to become CE Mark certified as a Class II medical device by a Notified Body. We are still, however, required to continue monitoring and ensuring our on-going compliance with certain other provisions under the new MDR requirements with respect to post-market surveillance of our products, as of May 2021.

The MDR differs in several important ways from the EU’s prior MDD directives for medical devices and active implantable medical devices. The most significant changes in the regulation include:
 

· | The definition of medical devices covered under the MDR will be significantly expanded to include devices that may not have a medical intended purpose, such as colored contact lenses. Also included in the scope of the regulation are devices designed for the purpose of “prediction and prognosis” of a disease or other health condition; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Device manufacturers will be required to identify at least one person within their organization who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new MDR. The organization must document the specific qualifications of this individual relative to the required tasks; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The MDR requires rigorous post-market oversight of medical devices; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The MDR will allow the EU Commission or expert panels to publish “Common Specifications”, such as requirements for technical documentation, risk management, or clinical evaluation, which devices shall be required to meet; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Devices will be reclassified according to risk, contact, duration, and invasiveness; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Systematic clinical evaluation will be required for Class IIa and Class IIb medical devices; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All currently approved devices must be recertified in accordance with the new MDR requirements. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Following Brexit, certain medical devices, including our products, are also required to meet the local regulatory requirements within the U.K., separate and apart from EU regulations that previously also covered commercial practices in the U.K. While our CE Mark still applies for the U.K., other U.K. requirements for regulatory monitoring and compliance must also be met. Our quality and regulatory compliance systems and practices are currently in the process of being updated for ensuring compliance with the applicable U.K. regulations.
 
General Data Protection Regulation
 
The implementation on May 25, 2018 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), a regulation in the EU on data protection and privacy for all individuals in the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), applies to all enterprises, regardless of location, that are doing business in the EU or that collect and analyze data tied to EU and EEA residents. GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations, including stringent technical and security controls surrounding the storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).
 
In July 2020, the European Commission invalidated the EU.-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, of which we were registrants. This has resulted in some uncertainty related to continuing obligations and future data transfer compliance obligations.

California Consumer Privacy Act
 
The California Consumer Privacy Act, “CCPA”, became effective on January 1, 2020 along with a number of complex privacy regulations affecting the processing of personal information of California residents. If we fail to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to significant financial penalties or adverse regulatory actions. In addition to the CCPA, the California legislature is exploring additional regulations to expand the scope and depth of the state’s data protection controls.
Competition
 
In the diagnostic and connected care markets, competition is also based on a variety of factors including product performance, functionality, value and breadth of sales and service organization. We believe that currently, there is a scarcity of new diagnostic platforms on the market, or otherwise proposed and approaching the market, that are competitive with our products for our primary intended discogenic low back pain indication. Accordingly, our primary competition resides with the current diagnostic standards over which our products are intended to improve – in particular, X-ray, lumbar MRI, and provocation discography (PD). While we believe our products are positioned for synergistic use with lumbar MRI, and to enhance the diagnostic value of lumbar MR exams, the existing reliance on MRI as a standard of care for our indication, and other potential enhancements to those platforms and techniques, nonetheless also represent competition. To the extent these other platforms represent our primary competitors, they are mainly provided by large, well-capitalized companies with significant market share and resources. Our competitors have more established sales and marketing programs than we do and have greater name recognition. These competitors also have long operating histories and may have more established relationships with our potential customers. In addition to competing for market share, competitors may develop or acquire patents or other rights that may limit our ability to compete.
 
Competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of our potential market share. We believe that our NOCISCAN product suite is superior to currently known competition in this market as follows:
 

· | We believe we are superior to standard lumbar MRI because:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


o | Standard lumbar MRI only indicates structural defects, degeneration, and hydration, which have not been well correlated to identifying painful discs in DLBP patients, whereas our products have been highly correlated to pain as indicated by positive Provocation Discogram results in a clinical trial published in a major peer-reviewed spine journal; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Standard lumbar MRI does not identify nor allow for measuring levels of acidic chemicals, such as lactic acid, that have been identified as a source of causing discs to become painful, and which we both identify and measure objectively and quantitatively; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Patient outcomes from surgeries following standard lumbar MRI diagnosis, but without the benefit of or following our diagnosis, have resulted in a much lower <60% success rate versus much higher >90% success rates shown for patient outcomes following surgeries that treat painful discs identified via our diagnostic products, as also demonstrated in the same published clinical trial referenced above. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We believe we are superior to standard Provocation Discogram (PD) because: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | PD is highly invasive, whereas our test is entirely non-invasive;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


o | PD is painful by deliberate design, whereas our test is entirely pain-free; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | PD has certain risks of harm, including certain reports of >1% risk of infection and increased risks of accelerating degeneration and/or herniation rates in discs after receiving needle injections form PD, whereas our test is non-significant risk and no more risky that standard lumbar MRI or other applications of MRS; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


30
--

o | PD is often performed, for optimal reliability and accuracy, with a CT scan to evaluate the distribution of injected dye in and around the disc, which requires a second diagnostic imaging exam and additional related costs, and which also exposes the patient to radiation, whereas our test is only a single exam, is more cost effective, and is entirely radiation free.

Employees
 
As of January 1, 2023, we had 7 total employees, 2 of whom were engaged in full-time research and development activities, 1 engaged in strategy and business development, and 4 of whom were engaged in general administration. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
Segment Information
 
We operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker function (which is fulfilled by our chief executive officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief executive officer allocates resources and assesses performance based upon financial information at the level. Since we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information is presented in the financial statements.

Implications of being an emerging growth company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
 

· | inclusion of only two years, as compared to three years, of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”); 
· | an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation; 
· | reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements; and 
· | an exemption from the requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior December 31st, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
We have taken advantage of the reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
