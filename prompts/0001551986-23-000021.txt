Overview
9 Meters is a clinical-stage company pioneering novel treatments for people with rare digestive diseases, gastrointestinal (“GI”) conditions with unmet needs, and debilitating disorders in which the biology of the gut is a contributing factor. Our pipeline includes vurolenatide, a proprietary Phase 3 long-acting glucagon-like-peptide 1 (“GLP-1”) agonist for short bowel syndrome (“SBS”) and a robust pipeline of early-stage candidates for undisclosed rare diseases and/or unmet needs. 
Our current product development pipeline is described in the table below:
Figure 1: Current product development pipeline
Corporate Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on rare or debilitating digestive diseases with the potential to transform current treatment paradigms for patients and address unmet medical needs. The critical components of our strategy are as follows:
•Advance the development of vurolenatide for the treatment of SBS. We announced positive results from our multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled randomized Phase 2 trial in SBS in the third quarter of 2022. Our Phase 3 study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of vurolenatide 50 mg administered subcutaneously every two weeks for 24 weeks in adults with SBS. 
•Advance preclinical development of NM-136 to support an investigational new drug application (“IND”) in 2023 for the treatment of obesity disorders. NM-136 is a long-acting, highly specific, humanized anti-GIP monoclonal antibody. We plan to file an IND in the second half of 2023. 
•Advance our early-stage drug product candidates for undisclosed rare and unmet needs. IND-enabling activities for NM-102, our proprietary tight-junction microbiome regulator, are ongoing. NM-003, our long-acting GLP-2 agonist, is currently undergoing a preclinical proof-of-concept study. 
•Acquire targeted clinical compounds for rare or debilitating digestive diseases with unmet needs. We continually evaluate in-licensing opportunities and may acquire targeted clinical compounds for rare or debilitating digestive diseases. 
•Pursue a capital-efficient commercialization strategy. For products with rare and/or orphan patient populations, our plan is to build an infrastructure to commercialize our drug products within the U.S. Drawing upon our expertise in both rare and digestive diseases, we aim to build a specialized yet efficient infrastructure that will support the entire commercialization continuum, including stakeholder education, treatment decision and initiation, and product access throughout the patient journey. In addition, we plan to seek partners to commercialize our drug products outside of the U.S. For large addressable markets, we plan to seek global partners with an established presence and history of successful commercialization. 
•Leverage, protect and enhance our intellectual property portfolio and secure patents for additional indications. We intend to expand our intellectual property, grounded in securing composition of matter patents and method of use patents for new indications. We plan to develop new formulations for our current product candidates for other indications and improve performance of existing product candidates. We plan to enhance the intellectual property portfolio further through learnings from ongoing clinical trials and manufacturing processes.
•Outsource capital-intensive operations. We plan to continue to outsource capital-intensive operations, including most clinical development and all manufacturing operations of our product candidates, and to facilitate the rapid development of our pipeline by using high quality specialist vendors and consultants in a capital efficient manner. 
Vurolenatide for the Treatment of Short Bowel Syndrome
Short Bowel Syndrome Background
SBS is a debilitating orphan disease of impaired nutrient and fluid absorption resulting from massive resection of the small intestine due to recurrent Crohn’s disease, vascular events, trauma, malignancy, and complications from abdominal surgery. Such resections hinder absorption of water, vitamins, protein, fat, calories and other nutrients from food, resulting in diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition. In addition, some patients depend on Parenteral Support (“PS”), which is the intravenous delivery of nutrition and fluids through a central line catheter. PS support is costly, burdensome, and associated with a myriad of complications. (Jeppesen 2014). A review of literature found that the mortality rate of adult patients with SBS ranges from 15-47% depending on age and length of parenteral nutrition (Schalamon 2003). Furthermore, a study that we commissioned found that SBS patients have a diminished quality of life due to urgent and frequent bowel movements at all times of the day, chronic diarrhea, weakness, exhaustion from dehydration, poor sleep quality, and mental anguish due to the impact of symptoms on their ability to live a normal life. 
Figure 2: Short bowel syndrome anatomy
Teduglutide is a treatment that is approved for patients with SBS. Marketed as Gattex® in the United States and Revestive® in Europe, it is approved for the treatment of SBS patients one year and older who are dependent on PS.  Teduglutide is an analog of glucagon-like peptide-2 (“GLP-2”), a hormone secreted postprandially by L-cells in sections of the bowel that are frequently removed in patients with SBS.  GLP-2 is involved in regulating normal nutrient and energy absorption in the intestine. While teduglutide has demonstrated clinical benefits, it requires daily injections and a multi-step reconstitution process. In addition, teduglutide’s patient population is constrained to patients who are on PS at least 3 times per week and excludes PS patients with GI malignancies. Furthermore, a review of teduglutide U.S. insurance claims across a 24-month period revealed a significant decline in persistency; 25% of patients discontinued therapy by month three, 38% discontinued by month six, 52% discontinued by month twelve and 66% by month twenty-four. (VectivBio Corporate Presentation). 
Market Opportunity for SBS
The true incidence and prevalence of SBS are unknown because no reliable patient database exists. However, review of epidemiology from several sources indicates that there are an estimated up to 20,000 SBS patients in the U.S. with similar prevalence in Europe. Furthermore, we believe that there is a significant patient opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and Latin America (Jeppesen 2014, Global Data, Mirador Global, Charles River Associates, European Medicines Agency).
Despite the limitations of teduglutide, Takeda projects peak global sales to reach $700 to $800 million (Takeda Wave 1 Pipeline Report, December 2020). We believe that the SBS patient population utilizing teduglutide is a fraction of the total addressable SBS patient population since it is limited to patients who are on PS at least 3 times per week. Claims analysis and market research that we have conducted have shown that most patients do not remain on a steady level of PS throughout their SBS journey, and in fact, 50-65% of patients may not be on PS at all at any given point in time (Mirador Global, Bionest Strategies). Accordingly, we believe that there is additional addressable global market opportunity for alternative therapeutic options that offer potential for improved dosing and administration, a faster onset of action, and an improved safety and tolerability profile, regardless of the level of PS. 
Figure 3: Target Product Profile
Vurolenatide is a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist that combines exenatide with a proprietary extended half-life technology for treatment of SBS. The long-acting linker technology is designed specifically to address the gastric effects in SBS patients by slowing digestive transit time. Vurolenatide uses proprietary XTEN® technology to extend the half-life of exenatide, potentially allowing for every other week dosing (“Q2W”), which could increase convenience for patients and caregivers.
Figure 4: Vurolenatide and XTEN technology
Phase 1b/2a Study of Vurolenatide
Vurolenatide has demonstrated efficacy and an extended half-life up to 30 days in a 70-patient clinical study and has received Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, (the “FDA”). We completed our Phase 1b/2a study in adult patients suffering from SBS in December 2020, with the goal of demonstrating safety and tolerability. 
On December 7, 2020, we announced positive topline results from our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for vurolenatide in SBS. The study met its primary objective, as vurolenatide was shown to be safe and well tolerated. In addition, vurolenatide demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in total stool output (“TSO”) volume within 48 hours of first dose. 
The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial was an open-label, two-dose study evaluating the safety and tolerability of three escalating fixed doses of vurolenatide (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg) in nine adults with SBS for 56 days. The trial was conducted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Patients in each of three cohorts received two subcutaneous doses two weeks apart with six weeks of subsequent follow-up. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of repeated doses on Days 1 and 15 at each dose level. Because reduced TSO volume and bowel movement frequency are correlated with improved intestinal absorption and potentially less need for intravenous supplementation for nutrition and hydration, these were key secondary objectives in the trial. The primary purpose of this open-label Phase 1b/2a study was to learn about the compound and its safety and potential efficacy to inform future development. 
Vurolenatide was generally safe and well tolerated: 17 treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were observed in nine patients, 15 of which were mild, transient and self-limited without further intervention. The majority of TEAEs were GI-related (nausea and vomiting).
Importantly, eight of the nine patients experienced meaningful declines in TSO following each dose, relative to a baseline output. The rapid onset of clinical improvements in stool volumes, as observed in all nine patients having substantial reductions in stool output within 48 hours of the first dose, shows the potential for vurolenatide to address the primary problem of chronic malabsorptive diarrhea in SBS patients. Additionally, four of seven patients showed reductions in bowel movement frequency after one dose, and five of six evaluable patients showed reductions in bowel movement frequency after the second dose. Furthermore, of the five patients on PS in the study, two patients showed reduction in PS after each dose. Results of the short form health survey quality of life instrument show directional improvement in multiple elements of health status over the course of the study. The short form health survey, or SF-36, is a set of generic, coherent and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are now widely utilized by managed care organizations and by Medicare for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients. 
Phase 2 Study of Vurolenatide
Following FDA communication in the first quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 2 study, VIBRANT (VurolenatIde for short Bowel syndrome Regardless of pArenteral support requiremeNT), of vurolenatide for the treatment of SBS in the second quarter of 2021 with adult patients using TSO as the primary efficacy outcome measure with PS as a secondary endpoint. This trial was a multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 
On September 26, 2022, we announced the results from our Phase 2 study of vurolenatide in SBS. The trial included four parallel treatment arms: vurolenatide 50 mg Q2W, vurolenatide 50 mg every week, vurolenatide 100 mg Q2W, and placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was change from baseline in mean 24-hour TSO volume over the six-week post-randomization observation period. 
The randomization block for the first 11 patients across the four arms resulted in three patients in each vurolenatide arm and two patients in the placebo arm. The mean 24-hour TSO decrease for the vurolenatide 50 mg Q2W treatment arm was 30% versus an increase of 32% in the placebo arm, for a relative reduction compared to placebo of 62%. This group showed a rapid (at one week) and sustained TSO reduction over the six-week post-randomization period. Importantly, TSO reduction from baseline was observed in 16 of the 18 weeks of the observation period in the 50 mg Q2W treatment group. These results, coupled with the most favorable adverse event and optimal pharmacokinetic profile, contributed to our decision to move this dose regimen forward into a pivotal clinical development program. 
In patients treated with vurolenatide 50 mg every week, there was a mean TSO decrease of 8%, for a relative reduction compared to placebo of 40%. In patients treated with vurolenatide 100 mg Q2W, there was a mean TSO increase of 16%, for a relative reduction compared to placebo of 16%. 
The study allowed the inclusion of SBS patients both requiring and not requiring PS. Five of the eleven patients in the study were receiving PS prior to entering the study and all five were randomly assigned to treatment with vurolenatide. Change from baseline in parenteral support volume, an important secondary endpoint, was also evaluated over the six-week observation period. There was a mean decrease of 17% in the parenteral support volume of these five patients by week two which was sustained throughout the six-week observation period. Of the five patients, two remained stable and three demonstrated a mean decrease in PS of 28%.
Among the 12 patients in the safety population, vurolenatide was generally well tolerated with mild to moderate and transient side effects, the most common of which were nausea and vomiting. One patient terminated early in the vurolenatide 100 mg Q2W arm due to nausea and vomiting. Importantly, there were no serious adverse events related to vurolenatide. Two serious adverse events were reported but deemed to be unrelated to study drug. Both were central catheter infections, which are common in patients with a central line. 
Figure 5: Phase 2 summary of results
Phase 3 Study Design
Based upon the results of the VIBRANT trial, we selected a dose and confirmed the design for the Phase 3 trial. The Phase 3 study, called VIBRANT 2, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vurolenatide 50 mg administered subcutaneously every two weeks for 24 weeks in adults with SBS. This international clinical study is designed to enroll approximately 120 patients with SBS with up to 50 clinical investigative sites in North America and Europe. The study population will include both SBS patients who meet the current PS dependence definition (PS required three or more times per week) and SBS patients who do not meet this PS requirement (PS required fewer than three times per week). The study design incorporates input received from the FDA, which was updated in March 2023 based on clarifying comments from the FDA in regard to certain aspects of the design. 
Patients with SBS suffer from severe malabsorption due to the lack of sufficient intestinal surface which results directly in severe and often debilitating fluid and nutritional losses in the form of chronic, recurrent diarrhea. This study will not only assess the degree to which vurolenatide can reduce weekly PS volume requirements, but it will also, for the first time in a large ambulatory study, assess the impact of vurolenatide on malabsorptive diarrhea as measured directly by TSO volume.
To maximize the potential for vurolenatide to provide clinical benefit to the entire SBS population regardless of PS requirement, VIBRANT 2 incorporates two primary efficacy endpoints: 1) absolute change from baseline in weekly PS volume which was the established primary efficacy outcome measure to support the approval of the GLP-2 agonist Gattex® (teduglutide) for treatment of SBS patients with a PS dependence; and 2) absolute change from baseline in mean TSO 
volume, which assesses TSO volume over the entire treatment period and incorporates specific FDA recommendations around the inclusion of nutrition and hydration parameters to help establish the clinical relevance of this novel endpoint.
Reduction in PS and TSO are both important clinical signs indicative of patients’ ability to absorb nutrients and fluids. It is planned that success on either primary efficacy endpoint can be the basis for a potential future NDA submission for vurolenatide. In addition, an interim analysis is planned when 50% of patients reach week 24. All patients who complete our VIBRANT 2 Phase 3 double-blind treatment period will be eligible to enter an open-label extension study with the objective of assessing the long-term safety of vurolenatide for up to 12 months. 
U.S. Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval has been secured and several key features have been incorporated that we believe will optimize the ability to enroll the study, including utilizing a clinical research organization (“CRO”) with specific experience executing late-stage clinical studies in SBS; securing up to 50 clinical study sites globally; and giving investigators the ability to enroll all SBS patients, regardless of PS status.

Product Candidates Being Evaluated for Development 
NM-136 Anti-GIP Humanized Monoclonal Antibody
NM-136 targets glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (“GIP”), a hormone found in the upper small intestine that is released into circulation after food is ingested, and when found in high concentrations, can contribute to obesity and obesity-related disorders. NM-136, an anti-GIP humanized monoclonal antibody, has been shown to prevent GIP from binding to its receptor, which in a preclinical obesity model showed a significant decrease in weight and abdominal fat by reducing nutrient absorption from the intestine as well as nutrient storage without affecting appetite. We are continuing the manufacturing and IND-enabling studies of NM-136 and intend to initiate a clinical proof-of-concept study for obesity later this year. 
Obesity is a global epidemic among 650 million people worldwide, with more than 30% of the population in the U.S. affected and up to 30% of the population in Europe affected (Novo Nordisk Capital Markets Day, March 2022). Obesity is implicated in many diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, respiratory disease, depression, infertility, and cancer. The World Health Organization predicts that 30% of global deaths in 2030 will be initiated by a lifestyle disease (Safaei, M. Et al). According to Morgan Stanley, the global obesity market will reach $54 billion by 2030, with nearly one-quarter of obese patients under active management by that time. Key drivers of the emerging obesity market include an increased focus on obesity as the upstream cause of disease, the success of recently launched “diabesity” 
treatments, increased patient and physician engagement regarding the disease, and increased payer engagement following guidelines updates and the potential passage of the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which will include coverage of Medicare screening and treatment of obesity by 2025. 
The obesity market can be characterized by five main therapeutic approaches: i) GLP-1, GLP-1/GIP agonists; ii) GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonists, GLP-1R/GIP/GCGR tri-agonists; iii) long-acting amylin analogues, iv) oral GLP-1 approaches; and v) long-acting GIPR antibodies. Of note, in December 2022, Amgen released data from their Phase 1 trial of AMG-133, a long-acting GIPR agonist, in patients with obesity and without other medical conditions. Data from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with single and multiple ascending dose cohorts demonstrated weight loss of 14.5% at day 85 following three monthly subcutaneous doses of AMG-133 420 mg with durable weight loss observed for 150 days after the final dose. Based on these findings, Amgen has initiated a Phase 2 dose ranging study of AMG-133 in obese patients with or without diabetes, with expected completion in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
NM-102 Tight Junction Microbiome Modulator 
NM-102, a small molecule peptide, is being developed as a potential microbiome modulator and is undergoing an indication selection process. NM-102 is a long-acting, degradation-resistant peptide, believed to be gut-restricted, and presumed to prevent antigens from trafficking into systemic circulation. On November 10, 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Gustave Roussy to investigate how tumors in preclinical models may affect intestinal integrity and in turn compromise the fitness of the host’s immune system and its capacity to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (“ICIs”). 
On November 14, 2022, we announced the preliminary findings of the investigation. Specifically, the work tested the hypothesis that the therapeutic effect of ICIs, such as antibodies to CTLA-4 and PD-1, might be enhanced by preventing bacterial antigens, toxins, and certain metabolites in the gut from interacting with the host immune system utilizing NM-102. These studies showed that NM-102 was effective both when alone and when combined with ICIs in a transgenic mouse model of spontaneous aggressive skin melanoma. Furthermore, the combination of NM-102 with ICIs improved survival compared to ICIs alone. More recent data continues to show NM-102 in combination with ICIs improves overall survival in select mouse tumor models. 
Furthermore, on March 2, 2022, we announced a collaboration with NYU Langone Health investigating the pre-clinical use of NM-102 for an undisclosed autoimmune condition with a large unmet need. We are currently progressing NM-102 through IND-enabling studies. 
NM-003 Long-Acting GLP-2
NM-003 is a proprietary long-acting GLP-2 receptor agonist with improved serum half-life compared with short-acting versions, which we intend to progress through a clinical and regulatory pathway in an undisclosed orphan and rare GI indication. On December 9, 2020, we announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to NM-003, for prevention of acute graft versus host disease. NM-003, also called teduglutide, is designed as a long-acting injectable GLP-2 receptor agonist that utilizes proprietary XTEN® technology to extend circulating half-life. NM-003 is currently undergoing an indication selection process. 
Larazotide (Partnered)
Larazotide is an 8-amino acid peptide formulated into an orally administered capsule. The larazotide drug product is an enteric coated drug product formulated as enteric coated multiparticulate beads filled into hard gelatin capsules for oral delivery. The enteric coating is designed to allow the bead particles to bypass the stomach and release larazotide upon entry into the small intestine (duodenum). A mixed bead formulation is used to allow partial release of larazotide upon entry into the duodenum and to release the remaining larazotide approximately 30 minutes later. 
Larazotide for the Treatment of Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome (“MIS-C”)
We entered a collaboration with the European Biomedical Research Institute of Salerno, Italy (“EBRIS”) to study larazotide for the treatment of MIS-C. MIS-C is a rare and serious complication of COVID-19 with symptoms that resemble those of Kawasaki disease, potentially including persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, myocardial dysfunction, and cardiogenic shock with ventricular dysfunction in the setting of multisystem inflammation. MIS-C occurs when SARS-CoV-2 superantigens move through the tight junctions between the gut epithelial cells into the bloodstream, leading to the hyperinflammatory immune response. We believe that larazotide’s mechanism of action as a tight junction regulator may 
prevent SARS-CoV-2 superantigens from entering the bloodstream. Following receipt of a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA under a filed Investigator IND, EBRIS initiated a Phase 2a study in MIS-C in the fourth quarter of 2021 to evaluate the use of larazotide in a group of children through a randomized placebo-controlled trial at MassGeneral Hospital for Children led by pediatric pulmonologist Lael Yonker, M.D. 
Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we will continue to supply larazotide for the ongoing clinical study. EBRIS will be responsible for the continued execution of the Phase 2a trial inclusive of all associated clinical costs.

We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, as appropriate. Additionally, we have licensed the rights to intellectual property related to certain of our product candidates, including patents and patent applications that cover the products or their methods of use or processes of manufacture. The terms of the licenses are described below under the heading “Licensing Agreements.” We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
In addition to patents and applications that we have licensed, we are the owner or co-owner of patent applications that have been filed relating to potential expansion of our product pipeline. We are the owner or co-owner of 2 issued or allowed U.S. patents and 2 issued or allowed foreign patents, as well as 32 pending patent applications covering formulations of larazotide and related compounds and methods of use for larazotide and related compounds (including NM-102). Some of these applications are co-owned with North Carolina State University, University of Maryland, Baltimore, or Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. We are also the owner of a pending patent application covering methods of use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including vurolenatide. The patents and patent applications that we own or co-own provide patent terms or anticipated patent terms ranging from 2038 to 2043.

Our success will in part depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology and products.

Licensing Agreements

License Agreement with Amunix 
In connection with the Naia Acquisition, we entered into two amended and restated license agreements with Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Amunix”), a Sanofi company, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with rights of sublicense, to lead molecules exenatide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) and GLP-2 analog fused to an XTEN amino acids sequence and other intellectual property referenced therein (the “Amunix Licenses”). Also in connection with the Naia Acquisition, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Cedars”), pursuant to which we licensed the rights to GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of SBS (the “Cedars License” and together with the Amunix Licenses, the “Naia Licenses”). Collectively, the Naia Licenses are intended to support our development of a therapy to treat SBS, which we refer to as vurolenatide.
Naia paid initial license fees and other development milestone payments due under the Naia Licenses prior to the Naia Acquisition, therefore, we did not pay any initial license fees upon the amendment and restatement of the original Naia Licenses. Pursuant to the terms of the Amunix Licenses, we agreed to expend in certain minimum financial amounts in direct support of development of the GLP-1 and GLP-2 products during specified development stages.
As consideration under the Amunix License for the GLP-1 receptor agonist rights, we agreed to pay Amunix certain royalty payments and (i) $70.4 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in the U.S. and major E.U. countries, (ii) $20.5 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in China and certain related territories, and (iii) $20.5 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in South Korea and certain other East Asian countries. As consideration under the Amunix License for GLP-2 rights, we agreed to pay Amunix certain royalty payments and $60.1 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in the U.S. and major EU countries.
As consideration under the Cedars License, we agreed to pay Cedars certain royalty payments and approximately $9.4 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones.
The majority of the intellectual property licensed from Amunix is controlled and maintained by Amunix and relates to their proprietary XTEN fusion protein technology, including fusion protein compositions, methods of use, and methods of manufacturing.
License Agreement with MHS Care Innovation LLC 
During July 2021, we entered into an amended and restated technology license agreement with MHS Care-Innovation LLC (“MHS”), pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide license, with rights to sublicense, to certain patent and other intellectual property rights concerning a proprietary and highly specific humanized monoclonal antibody that targets glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (the “MHS License”). The MHS License does not require the payment of any future milestone payments or royalties to MHS, since it was originally entered into with Lobesity in exchange for the issuance of certain equity securities and a grant of certain related rights to Lobesity, all of which occurred prior to the execution of the MHS License. As consideration for the assets purchased in the Lobesity Acquisition (including but not limited to the MHS License), we are obligated to pay Lobesity (i) potential worldwide regulatory and clinical milestone payments totaling $45.5 million for a single indication (with the total amount payable, if multiple indications are developed, not to exceed $58.0 million), (ii) up to $50.0 million in global sales-related milestone payments, and (iii) subject to certain adjustments, a mid-single digit royalty on worldwide net sales. 
License with Alba Therapeutics Corporation

In February 2016, we entered into a license agreement (the “Alba License”) with Alba Therapeutics Corporation (“Alba”) to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property relating to larazotide and related compounds.
The license agreement gives us the rights to (i) patent families owned by the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and licensed to Alba, (ii) certain patent families owned by Alba, and (iii) two patent families that are jointly owned by Alba and UMB. In connection with the Alba License, we also entered into a sublicense agreement with Alba under which Alba sublicensed the UMB patents to us (the “Alba Sublicense”).

As consideration for the Alba License, we agreed to pay (i) a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.4 million at the time of execution and (ii) set payments totaling up to $151.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones in connection with the development of the product, which future milestones include the acceptance and approval of a New Drug Application, the first commercial sale, and the achievement of certain net sales targets. The last milestone payment is due upon the achievement of annual net sales of larazotide in excess of $1.5 billion. Upon the first commercial sale of larazotide, the license becomes perpetual and irrevocable. The term of the Alba Sublicense, for which we paid a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.1 million, extends until the earlier of (i) the termination of the Alba License, (ii) the termination of the underlying license agreement, or (iii) an assignment of the underlying license agreement to us. The patents subject to the Alba sublicense have since expired. During 2019, we paid Alba a milestone payment of $0.3 million for the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 3 clinical trial. 
License Agreement with EBRIS
On August 6, 2021, we announced a collaboration with EBRIS to study larazotide for the treatment of MIS-C. In connection with this collaboration, we paid a milestone fee of $0.5 million upon IND approval for MIS-C. EBRIS initiated a Phase 2a study in MIS-C during the fourth quarter of 2021. The ongoing Phase 2a study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
On April 11, 2022, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “EBRIS License Agreement”) with EBRIS pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to EBRIS to study our product incorporating larazotide as its sole active pharmaceutical ingredient (the “Product”) for the treatment of MIS-C and, potentially, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (“MIS-A”). In turn, we will have an option to exclusively license from EBRIS any new intellectual property resulting from such development for purposes of developing, manufacturing, or commercializing products incorporating larazotide or any analog or derivative thereof for the treatment of MIS-C or MIS-A (the “Option”). 
Pursuant to the EBRIS License Agreement, the Company issued to EBRIS shares of common stock valued at $0.5 million and we will pay an additional $0.5 million in cash in connection with final database lock of the ongoing Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of MIS-C. Any time prior to the date three months following the completion of the development program contemplated by the EBRIS License Agreement and delivery of the results thereof to us, we may exercise the Option for an upfront fee of $1 million. In addition, if we exercise the Option, the EBRIS License Agreement contemplates certain contingent payments payable by us to EBRIS, including development milestone payments, sales-related milestone payments, and subject to certain adjustments, a low-single digit royalty on net sales in the United States of products incorporating larazotide or any analog or derivative thereof that (i) are covered by any patent rights licensed from EBRIS pursuant to the exercise of the Option, or whose regulatory approval for MIS-C or MIS-A relied on data generated by EBRIS, and (ii) sold pursuant to prescriptions for use in treating MIS-C or MIS-A. Of note, each payment is payable, at the option of the Company, in cash or unregistered shares of the Company’s common stock. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates, and for pre-clinical and clinical studies and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) eliminates the need to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing CMOs.
As we further develop our molecules, we expect to consider secondary or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates in a timely manner. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demand but we have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date. We currently engage CMOs on a ‘‘fee for services’’ basis based on our current development plans. We plan to identify CMOs and enter into longer-term contracts or commitments as we move our product candidates into Phase 3 clinical trials.

We believe alternate sources of manufacturing will be available to satisfy our clinical and future commercial requirements; however, we cannot guarantee that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources will be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates. All of the vendors we use are required to conduct their operations under current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), a regulatory standard for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Our potential competitors include both major and specialty pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of safe and effective product candidates that address the unmet needs of patients.
The competitive landscape in SBS is currently limited, which we believe is due to the previous regulatory precedent set by the approved agent teduglutide. To our knowledge, there are two therapies (glepaglutide and apraglutide) currently in Phase 3 trials. To our knowledge, there is no single agent approach dedicated to studying SBS patients using a GLP-1 agonist approach other than vurolenatide. A summary of the drugs in development for SBS is below:
Government Regulations 

The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs, such as those we are developing. Along with third-party contractors, we will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Government Regulation of Drugs

Before any of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States, they must be approved by the FDA. The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“cGLP”) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee for each clinical site before a clinical trial can begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all required clinical trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if required by the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCPs”); and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort, and financial resources and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing, information, and/or post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product candidate.

If regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of a product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drug candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, a new drug candidate is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, fill an unmet medical need, and demonstrate a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness in the treatment of that condition. 
A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for the following:
•more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval;
•more frequent written correspondence from FDA about the design of clinical trials;
•priority review to shorten the FDA review process for a new drug from ten months to six months; and,
•rolling review, which means 9 Meters can submit completed sections of its NDA for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed before the entire application can be reviewed.

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative 
treatments. Fast Track designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Orphan Drug Status

Vurolenatide has received orphan drug designation by the FDA. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product, as defined by the FDA, or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.

As in the United States, designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.

Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) determines that the request for designation was materially defective, or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition or if the incidence and prevalence of patients who are eligible to receive the drug in these markets materially increase. The inability to obtain or failure to maintain adequate product exclusivity for our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research, and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), and other division of DHHS, and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs and interactions with healthcare professionals must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, the Physician Self-Referral law (the “Stark Law”), physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and other federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.
Our business and our relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors are and will continue to be subject, directly and indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations. These laws also apply to the physicians and third-party payors who will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product candidates, if they become commercially available products. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we might market, sell and distribute our products and will impact, among other things, any 
proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. There are also laws, regulations and requirements applicable to the award and performance of federal grants and contracts. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to them, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the reimbursement of overpayments, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and earnings—any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare related laws and regulations include but are not limited to the following:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchase, lease or order, of any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program;
•the civil federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; conspiring to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the criminal federal False Claims Act, which imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who willfully make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent;
•the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), which imposes obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements; HIPAA also imposes criminal liability for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;
•federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Sunshine Act (“PSA”) created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations. The PSA requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members; and
•analogous or similar state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, and requirements—such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws—which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; laws, regulations, and requirements applicable to the award and performance of federal contracts and grants and state, federal and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health and other information in 
certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other laws, regulations, or other requirements that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, restitution exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, debarment from government contracts and grants and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and other consequences. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Moreover, availability of any federal grant funds which we may receive or for which we may apply is subject to federal appropriations law. Such grant funding may also be withdrawn or denied due to a violation of the above laws and/or for other reasons.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed into law on August 16, 2022, contains several health care provisions, including Medicare drug price negotiation. The Drug Price Negotiation Program will require HHS to negotiate a price for a specific number of drugs each year (10 in 2026, 15 in 2027, 15 in 2028, 20 in 2029 and annually thereafter), with the negotiation process starting in 2023. Drugs will be selected by ranking total expenditures in Medicare B and D (although only D in 2026 and 2027). The drugs must be single-source and among the top 50 in expenditures for Parts B or D. Drugs are eligible if at least seven years (small molecule) or eleven years (biologic) have elapsed since approval. Orphan drugs that are designated for only one rare disease or condition are exempt, as are drugs with Part B/D spend of less than $200 million. As such, we do not believe that vurolenatide will be subject to price negotiation. 

In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We adopted an anti-corruption policy as a part of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in January 2021. The anti-corruption policy mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure you that such a policy, or the procedures implemented to enforce such a policy, will protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators, or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and could have a negative impact on our business, on the results of our operations, and on our reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payers. Third-party payers include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payers will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, as each payer will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payer’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payer will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow them to sell our product candidates on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare delivery and payment systems in ways that could materially affect our ability to sell our products, if approved, profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and/or expanding access to healthcare services. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

By way of example, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, promote quality improvement and evidence-based care, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. 
Efforts to reform the healthcare sector are ongoing. Since its enactment, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) repealed the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision of the Affordable Care Act, which required most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. It is unclear what impact the repeal of the individual mandate will have on the viability of the insurance marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act or on the need for future reforms. The Trump administration also took executive actions to delay implementation of portions of the Affordable Care Act, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act’s “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act to increase the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” These revisions became effective January 1, 2019. 
The Biden administration has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to expand the number of people who are presently eligible for subsidies under the law. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued a new Executive Order directing federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care and to consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents. 
The prices of prescription drugs have been the subject of considerable discussion and debate in the United States and abroad. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries into prescription drug pricing, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, and attain and maintain profitability of our product candidates, if approved.
 The Budget Control Act of 2011, for instance, created, among other things, measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction in funding to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020—and also extended the 
sequester by one year, through 2030. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also reduced Medicare payments to certain providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws, and others, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug formularies and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates, if approved, and/or may constrain the prices that we are able to charge for such products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
We expect further reform to the Affordable Care Act, to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and to the regulation of the healthcare sector generally. Some of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Ongoing and future healthcare reform measures may result, for instance, in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our product candidates, if approved, and could harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.

Foreign Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to develop or sell any product candidates outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement, and privacy, can vary greatly from country to country.
Environmental, Social and Governance
The management team and Board of Directors of 9 Meters are keenly aware of the importance of environmental, social and governance issues, and the company’s need to conduct business with high standards. Our mission as an organization is to be patient-centric and develop innovative treatments to liberate patients from rare and underserved diseases through our deep understanding of GI biology. 
We collectively believe that pursuing an environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) agenda serves the interests of all of our stakeholders, which includes our stockholders. Our employees, partners, and investors expect us to honor our values and take action to promote a more equitable and sustainable world for future generations. 
As we further build our organization behind our pipeline of innovative products to treat rare and unmet needs in digestive diseases, we intend to strive to understand the perspectives of the diverse clients and communities we will serve, and as such, we are intensifying our efforts to drive diversity and inclusion and a culture of belonging throughout our organization. We will strive to comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and policies concerning environmental protection in all our business activities and in the selection of partners we choose to work with. We are committed to strengthening our local community by contributing through volunteerism and will continue, as we have been doing, to provide donations to parties we believe will support our goal of improving patient health and well-being. We are also committed to good corporate governance. All of our employees, officers and directors must conduct themselves according to the language and spirit of our Code of Conduct, and our Board of Directors is dedicated to providing effective corporate oversight including through oversight committees such as the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Audit Committee. As our Company grows, we will continue to integrate policies and programs that further foster this effort. 
Human Capital
We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business. We currently have 10 full-time employees and also engage consultants to provide services to us, including clinical development, manufacturing support, regulatory support, business development, and general business operational support. We continually evaluate our business needs and strive to balance in-house and outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource our drug product manufacturing to CMOs and will be using a CRO for our Phase 3 clinical trial of vurolenatide. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At 9 Meters, we are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion across all aspects of our organization, including hiring, promotion and development practices. We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, or any other status protected by applicable law. Our management team and employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior. 
We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace and have no tolerance for prejudice or racism. As of March 24, 2023, 35% of our employees self-reported as ethnically diverse individuals and 60% of our employees self-reported as female. 
We are committed to ensuring our employees receive equal pay for equal work. We establish components and ranges of compensation based on market and benchmark data. We commission third-party independent consultants to objectively assess and measure our compensation and benefits relative to peer companies within our industry. Within this context, we strive to pay all employees equitably within a reasonable range, taking into consideration factors such as role, relevant experience, internal equity, job location, and individual, business unit, and company performance. In addition, we are committed to providing benefits designed to allow our diverse workforce to have reward opportunities that meet their varied needs so that they are inspired to perform their best on behalf of patients and stockholders each day. We regularly review our compensation practices and analyze the equity of compensation decisions, for individual employees and our workforce as a whole. If we identify employees with pay gaps, we receive and take action to attain fidelity between our stated philosophy and actions. 
Strategic Evaluation and Cost Reduction Measures
We continue to evaluate potential financing, business development and strategic alternatives that might be available to us to maximize stockholder value, particularly given the Company’s current liquidity position. Potential strategic transactions may include equity or debt financings, mergers and acquisitions, licensing arrangements and partnerships, co-development agreements, a sale of our Company, a combination of these, or other strategic transactions. We currently have no commitments to engage in any specific strategic transactions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete additional financings, business development transactions or other strategic alternatives.
We have recently taken steps to reduce monthly operating expenses and conserve cash as we continue to explore strategic options. As described in Part II, Item 9B of this report, on March 23, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a reduction in force of 11 full-time employees (representing approximately 52% of our total workforce). We believe these changes will provide operating efficiencies for us to continue to support our product development programs as well as any potential partnerships, collaborations or other strategic relationships we may enter into. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to reduce costs.
