Company Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging proprietary technologies to develop drugs for patients with chronic renal or inflammatory diseases with high unmet medical needs. Our mission is to develop drugs that optimize health outcomes and improve patients’ quality of life.
 
We have two proprietary globally licensed drug development platforms, each of which was discovered by research scientists at the University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine (the “University of Miami” or “University”). These development platforms are:
 

● | Cholesterol Efflux MediatorTM, VAR 200 (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin or “2HPβCD”) is an injectable drug in clinical development for treatment of renal diseases. VAR 200 was licensed from L&F Research LLC on December 15, 2015. L&F Research was founded by the University of Miami research scientists who discovered the use of VAR 200 for renal diseases. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | IC 100 is a monoclonal antibody inflammasome ASC inhibitor in preclinical development for treatment of inflammatory conditions. IC 100 was licensed from InflamaCore, LLC on April 18, 2019. InflamaCore, LLC was founded by the University of Miami research scientists who invented IC 100. 

 
We believe that each of our product candidates has the potential to treat numerous indications in their respective therapeutic areas. Our strategy is to focus on indication expansion to maximize commercial potential.
 
Our renal pipeline is initially focused on rare, chronic glomerular diseases. Our lead indication for VAR 200 is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (“FSGS”). On January 21, 2020, we filed an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for VAR 200, and the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has allowed our development plans to proceed to a Phase 2a trial in patients with FSGS based on the risk/benefit profile of the active ingredient (2HPβCD). Prior to initiating a Phase 2a trial in patients with FSGS, we are planning to support an open-label investigator-initiated trial (“IIT”) in Q4-2023 where we expect to obtain human proof-of-concept data in up to three renal patient cohorts. This will enable assessment of drug effects as patients proceed through treatment and will provide insights for developing our Phase 2a protocol. In addition to FSGS, VAR 200 has pharmacologic proof-of-concept data in animal models representative of Alport Syndrome and diabetic kidney disease, each of which may be developed based on our indication expansion strategy.
 
Our inflammasome ASC inhibitor program, IC 100, is in preclinical development. Our focus is on advancing 1C 100 toward a currently planned IND submission in Q2-2024, followed by initiation of a Phase 1 trial. IC 100 has pharmacologic proof-of-concept data in animal models representative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) and multiple sclerosis (“MS”). We plan to conduct additional animal studies in up to six indications, such as immunoglobulin A (“IgA”) nephropathy, Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, congestive heart failure, and early Alzheimer’s disease, in our next waves of preclinical development. We anticipate that one or more lead indications for IC 100 will be selected based on data from our preclinical program.

About Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
 
Chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) is an increasing public health problem which affects over 75 million people worldwide, and approximately 37 million in the United States. The National Kidney Foundation estimates that approximately 80 million adults are at risk for kidney disease in the United States. With no disease modifying drug therapies commercially available, a sizeable percentage of kidney patients progress to end-stage renal disease (“ESRD”), requiring dialysis or transplant to survive. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2018, approximately 131,600 people in the United States started treatment for ESRD, and nearly 786,000 people are currently living with ESRD in the United States (of those 786,000 people, approximately 71% are on dialysis, and 29% are living with a kidney transplant). Further, the economic burden associated with chronic kidney disease can be substantial, as Medicare Fee-for-Service spending was $130 billion in 2018 according to the National Kidney Foundation. We believe the high incidence level and the steep monetary burden caused by CKD create a need for effective, disease modifying drug therapies.
 
CKD is associated with poor prognosis and in 2017, according to the National Vital Statistics Report, CKD was the ninth-leading cause of death in the United States. To address this significant health problem, on July 10, 2019, the White House and Department of Health and Human Services launched the Advancing American Kidney Health (“AAKH”) initiative to advance kidney disease prevention and care in the United States, which has three goals: (1) to reduce the number of patients developing renal failure through better diagnosis, treatment, and preventative care; (2) to maximize provision of home dialysis care; and (3) to expand the pool of kidneys available for transplant. We believe that by mediating removal of excess renal intracellular cholesterol that contributes to kidney damage and dysfunction, VAR 200 has the potential to help address the AAKH initiative’s first goal to reduce the number of patients developing renal failure.
 
Our lead renal indication is FSGS, which is a progressive form of kidney disease with no approved drug therapies. Approximately 40-60% of FSGS patients develop end stage kidney disease within 10-20 years, requiring dialysis and ultimately kidney transplant to survive. FSGS is an orphan disease affecting approximately 40,000 people in the United States. It is characterized by injury to the kidneys’ filtration system or “glomerular podocytes” leading to scarring that is focal (i.e., affecting only some glomerulus) and segmental (i.e., affecting only part of glomerulus). Accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in renal glomeruli, which has been associated with structural damage and impaired kidney function, has been seen in FSGS patient biopsies and in representative FSGS animal models. Damage to the glomeruli causes protein to leak into urine, a condition known as proteinuria. As the level of protein increases in the urine, patients develop a specific set of symptoms known as nephrotic syndrome. Proteinuria is strongly associated with kidney disease progression, and nephrotic syndrome is generally predictive of a poor prognosis. Approximately 70% of FSGS patients present with nephrotic syndrome at diagnosis. By mediating removal of excess cholesterol from renal glomeruli, we believe that VAR 200 has the potential to preserve renal structure and function and thereby reduce proteinuria that leads to FSGS progression.
 
About Inflammatory Diseases
 
Chronic inflammatory diseases have been recognized as one of the most significant causes of death in the world today, with more than 50% of all deaths worldwide attributable to inflammation-related diseases such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) and autoimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Excessive and persistent activation of inflammasomes have been linked to the pathophysiology of these types of chronic diseases.
 
Inflammasomes are comprised of 3 proteins: (i) one of several types of sensor molecules, (ii) an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (“ASC”), and (iii) proinflammatory caspase-1 (“pro-caspase-1”). There are multiple types of inflammasomes that trigger inflammation. They are named based on their associated sensor molecule, such as NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin. Numerous inflammatory diseases are often associated with activation of multiple types of inflammasomes. For example, multiple sclerosis is associated with activation of AIM2, NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4. The ASC component of inflammasomes is a promising drug target since it is a component of the six most common types of inflammasomes referenced above. We believe this is more advantageous than targeting a specific sensor protein, a component of one type of inflammasome, which is the focus of several potential competitors. In addition to its pivotal role in inflammasome formation and activation required for initiation of an inflammatory response, ASC also plays a role in the perpetuation of inflammation associated with extracellular release of ASC specks. By targeting ASC, we believe IC 100 has potential to effectively control inflammation in a multitude of inflammatory diseases.

Our Pipeline
 
The goal of our pipeline is to target renal and inflammatory indications with high unmet medical needs, which we believe can be addressed by our mechanisms of action. We intend to further enhance and expand our product portfolio through the development of multiple indications for each of VAR 200 and IC 100, and through potential in-licensing of promising renal and anti-inflammatory product candidates.
 
Our current pipeline consists of the following:
 



1. | Development Phase: Phase in which a drug formulation is developed that ensures the proper drug delivery parameters are met. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Pre-clinical Phase: Phase in which in vitro (laboratory) and in vivo (animal) studies are conducted to gather evidence to justify clinical trials in humans. 
3. | FDA concurred that a Phase 1 trial was not required for VAR 200 based on VAR 200’s established historical safety profile. 

 
For VAR 200, our lead renal indication is FSGS (VAR 200-01). For IC 100, we will select one or more lead indications prior to our IND filing planned for Q2-2024. This will be based on data from existing and future preclinical studies.
 
With the myriad of diverse diseases and conditions mediated by chronic inflammation, we believe IC 100 has potential to treat a multitude of inflammatory diseases. The following is a summary of the market for IC 100’s current pipeline.

Business Strategy
 
We seek to be recognized as a leading biopharmaceutical company at the forefront of innovation for patients with high unmet medical needs. We are committed to restoring health and transforming the lives of patients through development of biopharmaceutical products. Our strategy is to:

● | Advance development of VAR 200. We intend to advance development of VAR 200 by supporting an open-label IIT in up to 3 cohorts of renal patients in Q4-2023, to be followed by initiation of a Phase 2a clinical trial. The IIT will enable assessment of drug effects in patients as they proceed through the trial. Key learnings will be used for design of the Phase 2a trial. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Advance our IC 100 preclinical program. We intend to advance our IC 100 preclinical program toward a planned IND submission in Q2-2024. We currently have non-GLP toxicology data in mice and non-human primates (“NHP”) demonstrating no adverse effects at doses as high as 300mg/kg, and pharmacologic proof-of-concept data for IC 100 in animal models representative of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple sclerosis. We plan to conduct GLP toxicology studies in mice and NHP, and additional animal studies in up to 6 additional indications (such as IgA nephropathy, Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, congestive heart failure, and early cognitive impairment). This will enable optimal selection of one or more lead indications to take into the clinic. 
● | Capitalize on our indication expansion strategy to maximize the commercial potential for each of our product platforms by developing multiple indications in their respective therapeutic areas. Our current pipeline includes three potential indications for our Cholesterol Efflux MediatorTM Platform, VAR 200, (including, FSGS, Alport Syndrome, and diabetic kidney disease), and eight potential indications for our IC 100 inflammasome ASC inhibitor platform (including, ARDS, multiple sclerosis, IgA nephropathy, Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, congestive heart failure, and early Alzheimer’s disease. We intend to leverage our knowledge from preclinical and clinical programs from both product platforms to identify other opportunities for indication expansion. 
● | Maintain rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates. We intend to maintain the rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates in the United States, while pursuing strategic alliances and collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to accelerate development, share risk, supplement our resources and maximize potential outside the United States. 
● | Expand our product candidate portfolio. We plan to expand our product portfolio by leveraging our expertise in development and commercialization to identify and in-license additional drug candidates with significant clinical and commercial potential. In addition to indication expansion for our VAR 200 and IC 100 platforms, our business strategy includes identifying and opportunistically acquiring development and commercialization rights to technologies relating to the treatment of kidney and inflammatory diseases. 
● | Continue to strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio. The intellectual property for VAR 200 is comprised of a portfolio of issued and pending patents in the United States and other countries. We have 2 patent families covering glomerular disorders and disease, and diabetic kidney disease. Likewise, we plan to seek orphan drug designation for FSGS and Alport Syndrome, which would provide 7 years exclusivity in United States and 10 years in European Union, if approved for each of those jurisdictions. Intellectual Property for IC 100 is comprised of a portfolio of issued and pending patents in the United States and other countries. We have 5 patent families covering composition of matter, biomarkers, and methods of use. Additionally, we plan to seek orphan exclusivity for any rare disease indications we develop for IC 100. For both product platforms, our proprietary position is reinforced by additional technical know-how and trade secrets. We plan to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates by filing for patents or other applicable intellectual property protection covering new or enhanced proprietary technology, and new formulations, dosing regimens, and administration routes in development. 

 
The dates and events reflected in the foregoing are estimates only, and there can be no assurances that the events included will be completed on the anticipated timeline presented, or at all. Further, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in the development of any of our product candidates, or any other products or product candidates we may develop in the future, or that any product candidate we may develop in the future, will receive FDA approval for any indication.

Our Product Candidates
 
Cholesterol Efflux Mediator TM, VAR 200 (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, 2HPβCD)
 
Cholesterol Efflux Mediator VAR 200 is an injectable drug in clinical development for treatment of chronic glomerular diseases, initially focusing on FSGS. Alport Syndrome and diabetic kidney disease indications may be pursued based on our indication expansion strategy.
 
VAR 200 was developed with the intent to preserve renal structure and function, and reduce proteinuria that leads to glomerular disease progression by mediating removal of excess cholesterol that damages renal glomeruli. For our lead renal indication, FSGS (VAR 200-01), we are planning to support an open-label IIT in 2023 where we expect to obtain human proof-of-concept data in up to 3 renal patient cohorts, to be followed by initiation of a Phase 2a trial in patients with FSGS. Based on the anticipated data and key learnings from these trials, we may progress development of VAR 200 for Alport Syndrome (VAR 200-02) and for diabetic kidney disease (VAR 200-03) based on our indication expansion strategy.
 
Role of Cholesterol and Lipid Accumulation in Glomerular Diseases (Including FSGS, Alport Syndrome, and Diabetic Kidney Disease)
 
In chronic glomerular diseases, cholesterol accumulates in glomerular podocytes, due in part to impaired transport out of the cell, or “efflux,” resulting from reduced expression of the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Glomerular lipid accumulation has been demonstrated by in vitro podocyte studies, in human biopsy data, and in animal models of various kidney diseases, including FSGS, Alport Syndrome, and diabetic kidney disease. As shown below, the lipid accumulation causes distorted podocyte structure, damaged podocyte foot processes, and podocyte detachment and loss, which impairs kidney filtration resulting in proteinuria and disease progression. We hypothesize that restoration of lipid homeostasis and podocyte integrity has the potential to slow ongoing kidney damage progression to kidney failure, and delay the need for dialysis and ultimately transplant.
 


VAR 200 Mechanism of Action
 
VAR 200’s active ingredient, 2HβCD, is comprised of seven sugar molecules bound together in a 3-D ring with a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior. VAR 200 mediates cholesterol efflux both passively and actively by interacting with hydrophilic components of the glomerular membrane.
 

10
--

Passive Cholesterol Efflux
 
Passive cholesterol efflux occurs with formation of 2HPβCD dimers, which bind to the cell membrane surface and incorporate cholesterol into its hydrophobic core as an inclusion complex. Release of the 2HPβCD/cholesterol inclusion complex from the cell membrane surface brings the cholesterol into solution for transfer to cholesterol acceptors, such as high-density lipoprotein (“HDL”).
Active Cholesterol Efflux
 
Active cholesterol efflux occurs through mediating metabolism of free cholesterol into oxysterols. Oxysterols activate the liver X receptor (“LXR”)-transcription factors, resulting in induction of cellular cholesterol efflux pathways, including upregulation cholesterol efflux transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, which transport free cholesterol outside the cell to cholesterol acceptors, such as HDL.
 
Preclinical Support for VAR 200
 
We believe that VAR 200 has an established benefit/risk profile supported by our in vivo studies and decades of use as an excipient. Additionally, it is our belief that data from animal models representing FSGS, Alport Syndrome, and diabetic kidney disease demonstrate that VAR 200 promotes cholesterol removal from podocytes, protecting the kidney’s filtration system from damage and reducing protein spillage into the urine or “proteinuria.” These types of outcomes are thought to be key to delaying or preventing progression of kidney disease.
 
VAR 200 and FSGS
 
VAR 200 was evaluated in two FSGS mouse models, an experimental nuclear factor of activated T-cells (“NFAT”) FSGS model and an Adriamycin (“ADR”)-induced FSGS model, which is characterized by a milder, less progressive form of nephropathy than the NFAT model.
 
Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells (NFAT) Model
 
In a study to examine the role of altered podocyte cholesterol homeostasis in NFAT-mediated podocyte injury and the effects of treatment with VAR 200, researchers administered VAR 200 subcutaneously at 4,000 mg/kg to 6-week-old NFATc1nuc mice 24 hours prior to induction with doxycycline, and then every other day for 4 days. Single transgenic (“ST”) mice served as a control.

VAR 200 (indicated by “CD” in the graphs below) significantly reduced cholesterol in the renal cortex of FSGS mice compared to untreated double transgenic mice (indicated by “DT” in the graphs below). This was associated with a significant reduction in proteinuria (albumin/creatine ratio) as shown below.
 

Adriamycin (ADR)-induced Model
 
In the second FSGS model, researchers injected 5-week-old BALB/c mice with one dose of Adriamycin at 11 mg/kg. Subsequently, VAR 200 was administered 24 hours later at 40 mg/kg via subcutaneous osmotic pump for 10 weeks. Non-induced mice served as a control.
 
VAR 200 (indicated by “CD” in the graphs below) significantly reduced mesangial expansion, which is commonly associated with lipid deposition, compared to untreated ADR-induced mice as shown below. This was associated with a significant reduction in proteinuria (albumin/creatine) and blood urea nitrogen (“BUN”) in VAR 200-treated) ADR-induced mice compared to untreated ADR-induced mice as shown below.
 


VAR 200 and Alport Syndrome
 
In another study, to evaluate whether VAR 200 has a protective effect in Alport Syndrome, researchers injected four-week-old female Col4a3 knockout (Col4a3−/−) mice with VAR 200 at 4000 mg/kg subcutaneously 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Wild type Col4a3 (“Col43+/+”) mice served as controls.

VAR 200 (indicated by “CD” in the graphs below) significantly reduced renal neutral lipid, cholesterol ester, and cholesterol crystal accumulation in Alport Syndrome mice when compared to untreated Alport Syndrome mice as shown below.

The decreased intracellular lipids in VAR 200-treated Alport Syndrome mice were associated with a significant reduction in renal damage (reduced mesangial expansion, fibrosis, and foot process effacement), and renal function was maintained when compared to untreated Alport Syndrome mice, as evidenced by reduced proteinuria (albumin/creatinine), blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine when compared to untreated Alport Syndrome mice as shown below.

VAR 200 and Diabetic Kidney Disease
 
In another study to determine if VAR 200 can sequester intracellular cholesterol and protect podocytes from cholesterol-dependent damage in diabetic kidney disease, researchers treated 4-week old BTBR ob/ob homozygous mice, a diabetic model of progressive kidney disease, with 3 weekly subcutaneous injections of VAR 200 at 4,000 mg/kg for 5 months. Heterozygous mice served as controls.
 
VAR 200 (indicated by “CD” in the graphs below) significantly reduced total cholesterol in the kidney cortex compared with untreated diabetic mice. This was associated with a significant reduction in renal damage (mesangial expansion) and reduced proteinuria (albumin/creatinine) compared to untreated diabetic mice starting at 2 months following treatment, with statistically significant reduced levels from 3 months to end of study as shown below.
 


Based on the results in animal models of 3 different renal diseases summarized above, we believe that VAR 200 has potential to induce and maintain partial or complete remission of proteinuria in renal patients with nephrotic syndrome, thereby reducing the rate of renal disease progression.
 
IC 100 (Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor)
 
IC 100 is a monoclonal antibody inflammasome ASC inhibitor in preclinical development for the treatment of numerous inflammatory diseases. IC 100 was developed with the intent of mediating chronic aberrant inflammation that is pathogenic in a multitude of inflammatory diseases by blocking initiation and perpetuation of the innate inflammatory response to stop disease progression and improve quality of life.
 
A lead indication as not yet been identified for IC 100. Our focus is on advancing IC 100 toward a planned submission of an IND application in Q2-2024, which we intend to be followed by initiation of a Phase 1 trial. IC 100 has pharmacologic proof-of-concept data in animal models representative of ARDS and MS. We plan to conduct GLP toxicology studies in mice and NHP and conduct additional animal studies in up to 6 additional indications, such as IgA nephropathy, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, congestive heart failure, and early Alzheimer’s disease, in our next waves of preclinical development (including,). One or more lead indications for IC 100 will be selected based on data from our preclinical program.

Role of Inflammasomes in Inflammatory Diseases
 
Excessive and persistent activation of inflammasomes have been linked to the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that initiate an immune response to pathogens or internal danger signals. They are comprised three basic proteins: (i) one of several types of sensor molecules (e.g., NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin), (ii) adaptor protein, ASC, and (iii) pro-caspase 1. Each sensor molecule responds to different pathogens or internal danger signals.
 
As depicted below, in the presence of harmful pathogens or cell damage, an intracellular sensor molecule (e.g., NLRP3) is triggered, stimulating recruitment of adaptor ASC, which in turn recruits pro-caspase-1 to form an inflammasome. The inflammasome is the organizing center that recruits additional ASC and polymerizes in a prion-like structure to form a large filamentous signaling platform, known as an ASC Speck. ASC Specks provide a scaffold for pro-caspase-1 recruitment, which triggers conversion of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1, which in turn converts the cytokine pro-IL-1ß to its active form IL-1ß, initiating the inflammatory response. Activated caspase-1 also drives cleavage of Gasdermin D, which triggers pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, releasing active cytokines and ASC Specks into the extracellular space, with continued activation of pro-IL-1ß, heightening and perpetuating the inflammatory response in neighboring cells and tissues. Although inflammasome triggering of the innate immune response is essential for protection against pathogens, persistent overactivation of inflammasomes can lead to chronic inflammation underlying a multitude of inflammatory conditions and diseases. Numerous inflammatory diseases are associated with activation of multiple types of inflammasomes. For example, multiple sclerosis is associated with activation of AIM2, NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4.

IC 100 Mechanism of Action
 
IC 100 was designed to bind to key amino acids in adaptor protein ASC that govern ASC recruitment into the inflammasome complex and ASC Speck formation:
 

● | By inhibiting ASC recruitment into the inflammasome complex, inflammasome formation is inhibited thereby blocking initiation of the inflammatory cascade; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | By disrupting ASC Speck formation, both intracellularly and extracellularly, damaging perpetuation of inflammation is blocked. 

Inflammasome Activation in One Condition Can Impact Another
 
A recent paper published in Translational Research demonstrates that inflammasome activity and signaling proteins triggered by one unique inflammatory condition can impact and potentially interact with another. The authors provided extensive evidence that traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are linked by activation of multiple types of inflammasomes (NLRP3, NLRP1, and AIM2). In each condition, inflammasome activation leads to cell death and release of active cytokines and ASC specks to neighboring cells allowing for one condition to potentially exacerbate the other. For example, individuals with a history of moderate TBI have a 2.3 times greater risk of developing AD. Likewise, AD pathology is potentially exacerbated by inflammasome activation in patients with TBI through IL-18 and pathological ASC speck interactions with amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau, hallmarks of AD. The authors reported that inflammasome ASC represents a promising therapeutic target for TBI and AD because of ASC’s unique role in heightening and perpetuating inflammation in neighboring cells, and its pathological interactions with amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau. In a subsequent study, also published in Translational Research by several of the same authors, researchers evaluated if blocking inflammasome activity by inhibiting ASC with IC 100 reduces the elevated inflammatory response in AD mice after TBI. Data demonstrated that 100 resulted in reduction of inflammasome-mediated cytokine IL-1β in the injured cortex of AD mice at 1-week post-injury. This is consistent with preclinical studies conducted with IC 100, demonstrating reduced inflammatory activity, and improved histological and/or functional outcomes in models of traumatic brain injury and age-related brain inflammation (associated with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease), highlighted in the next sections below.

Preclinical Support for IC 100
 
Non-GLP toxicology studies in mice and non-human primates demonstrate that IC 100 has a good safety profile. There were no drug-related adverse events at doses up to 300 mg/kg in either species. Likewise, epigenetic screening demonstrates a lower immunogenicity potential than many biologics. Based on our preclinical study in an animal model representing MS, inflammation was attenuated without immunosuppression. In addition to the studies in traumatic brain injury and age-related inflammation (early cognitive impairment) referenced above, IC 100 has pharmacologic proof-of-concept data in animal models representative of ARDS and MS, and mechanistic proof-of-concept data in animal models representative of spinal cord injury.
 
IC 100 and MS
 
In one study to determine if IC 100 protects against MS progression, researchers induced active experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (“EAE”) in C57BL/6 mice through immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35 – 55 (“MOG35 – 55”). IC 100 was administered via intraperitoneal (“IP”) injection at 10, 30, or 45 mg/kg on day 8 before appearance of clinical symptoms, followed by treatment every 4 days for 32 days. Vehicle served as a control.
 
IC 100 penetrated the spinal cord and decreased the number of spinal cords activated microglial CD4+, CD8+, and myeloid cells. This was associated with delayed onset and significantly improved functionality based on MS clinical scores as shown below.

IC 100 and ARDS
 
In another study to determine if IC 100 can improve histopathological outcomes in ARDS, researchers induced acute lung injury and subsequent ARDS in naïve mice by delivering extracellular vesicles (“EV”) from mice with traumatic brain injury, followed by IV administration of a functional prototype of IC 100 at 5 mg/kg 1 hour after EV delivery; animals were sacrificed 24 hours later. Data were compared to naïve, sham (saline), untreated, or enoxaparin at 3mg/kg experimental groups.
 
IC 100 inhibited inflammasome and cytokine activation in lungs as evidenced by a reduction in caspase-1, ASC, IL-1β, AIM2, HMGB1 when compared with untreated positive control animals. This was associated with improved histological outcomes and reduced acute lung injury scores indicative of decreased lung injury severity.

IC 100 Mechanistic Proof of Concept Data
 
Spinal Cord Injury
 
To determine the effects of ASC neutralization in spinal cord injury, researchers administered 50 mcg of anti-ASC tool antibody IV and IP 20 minutes after injury in Fischer rats subjected to moderate cervical spinal cord injury (“SCI”). Anti-ASC neutralizing antibodies decreased caspase-1 activation and cytokine levels, improved histopathological outcomes and decreased spinal cord lesion volume, and improves functional outcomes (e.g., motor skills) compared to controls.
 
Based on the promising results in animal models of various inflammatory diseases, we believe IC 100 has potential to mediate the persistent damaging inflammation associated with inflammatory disease and improve outcomes.
 
Traumatic Brain Injury
 
The effects of ASC neutralization in traumatic brain injury were evaluated in two different animal models, a penetrating ballistic-like brain injury model, and a fluid percussion injury model.
 
In the penetrating ballistic-like brain injury model, researchers performed IV administration of a functional prototype of IC 100 at 5 mg/kg four hours after injury in Sprague-Dawley rats receiving a penetrating ballistic-like brain injury. IC 100 decreased inflammasome activation, as evidenced by decreased caspase-1 activity, and pyroptosis in microglia and infiltrating leukocytes compared with vehicle control.

In the fluid percussion injury model, researchers performed IV administration of anti-ASC tool antibody at 15 mcg immediately after injury in Sprague — Dawley rats receiving a fluid-percussion injury. Immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) served as a control. Neutralization of ASC interfered with NLRP1 inflammasome signaling, leading to a significant reduction caspase-1 compared with IgG. This was associated with a significant reduction in contusion volume.
 
Age-related Inflammation (Early Cognitive Impairment)
 
To determine the effects of IC 100 on age-related inflammation, which is representative of early cognitive impairment, a functional prototype of IC 100 was administered via IP injection at 10 mg/kg for 3 days to aged mice (i.e., 18 months old). Aged mice receiving saline control, and untreated young mice (i.e., 3 months old) served as controls. IC 100 reduced inflammasome protein levels (i.e., NLRP1, ASC, capsase-1) and ASC Specks associated with a reduction of IL-1β, indicating that IC 100 reduces inflammasome activation in the cortex of aged mice.
 
ASC as a Biomarker
 
Biomarkers are valuable tools to predict, diagnose, and monitor disease progression. They can also be used to target patients who are likely to respond to specific treatments, and to monitor ongoing efficacy of those treatments over time.
 
Researchers at the University of Miami evaluated serum inflammasome proteins as potential biomarkers for inflammatory disorders and identified ASC as a potential candidate. Serum ASC levels were elevated in patients with various inflammatory disorders when compared to healthy people. Additionally, when compared to caspase-1 as a biomarker in patients with multiple sclerosis, ASC had a similar sensitivity to caspase-1, but a significantly higher specificity than caspase-1.
 

ASC levels have been demonstrated to correlate with disease outcomes and disease severity, for example:

Market and Commercial Opportunity
 
We believe that our lead product candidates have potential for treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including (i) our lead renal product candidate, VAR 200, in development for potential treatment of multiple renal indications such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and Alport Syndrome (orphan indications), and diabetic nephropathy; and (ii) our lead anti-inflammatory product candidate, IC 100, for treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases, including, but not limited to multiple sclerosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. VAR 200 has not yet been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for FSGS or Alport Syndrome.

FSGS Market
 
The total addressable market for disease-specific drug therapies for FSGS has not been established because there are no approved drug therapies specific to the condition (please see the next section which discusses the current treatment limitations). FSGS, an orphan indication, is estimated to affect around 40,000 people in the United States, with more than 5,400 new cases diagnosed annually, according to Nephcure Kidney International. FSGS is most common in adults 45 years of age and older and occurs in Black Americans at a rate that is four times higher than in Caucasian Americans.
 
Current FSGS Treatments and Limitations
 
At present, there are no commercially available disease-specific treatments for FSGS and there is no known cure. Current therapy focuses on maintaining adequate nutrition, controlling blood pressure and serum lipids, minimizing loss of protein in the urine, and preventing complications from edema, thereby stabilizing kidney function. The most common drug therapy includes diuretics for edema, ACE inhibitors and ARBs for reduction of proteinuria, other antihypertensive agents, and lipid lowering drugs. Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are also used to induce partial remission of proteinuria.
 
We believe that there is a significant unmet need for effective FSGS-specific treatments that can delay disease progression, prevent end-stage renal disease, improve patients’ quality of life, and reduce the health economic burden.
 
Alport Syndrome (AS)
 
AS, an orphan indication, is a progressive, inherited form of kidney disease that is often associated with hearing loss and abnormalities of the eye. It is caused by genetic mutations in genes encoding members of the type IV collagen family that ultimately cause lipid accumulation and scarring of the basement membranes of the kidney, or “glomerulus”, the inner ear, or “cochlea”, and the eye. A key, early feature of AS is blood in the urine, or “hematuria”, with a progressive decline in kidney function ultimately resulting in kidney failure. Hearing loss affecting both ears occurs in late childhood or early adolescence, generally before the onset of kidney failure. Patients may also have misshapen lenses in the eyes (anterior lenticonus) and abnormal retina coloration, but these abnormalities seldom lead to vision loss. Prognosis for patients with AS is poor.
 
AS Market
 
The total addressable market for disease-specific drug therapies for AS has not been established because there are no FDA approved drug therapies specific to the condition (please see the next section which discusses the current treatment limitations). AS represents all geographic and ethnic groups. Although the overall incidence in the general population is unknown, U.S. data demonstrates AS accounts for three percent of children and 0.2% of adults with end-stage kidney disease. The gene frequency of AS in the United States has been estimated at 1:5,000 to 1:10,000 people, suggesting there are approximately 30,000 to 60,000 affected individuals, according to the National Organization of Rare Diseases.
 
Current AS Treatments and Limitations
 
There are currently no commercially available disease-specific treatments for AS. Current therapy focuses on minimizing loss of protein in the urine and preventing complications from edema to help stabilize kidney function. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (“ACE”) inhibitor therapy or angiotensin receptor blocker (“ARB”) therapy is recommended in individuals with AS who show overt proteinuria. We believe that there is a significant unmet need for effective AS-specific treatments that can delay disease progression, prevent end-stage renal disease and hearing loss, and improve patients’ quality of life.

Diabetic Nephropathy
 
Kidney disease or “nephropathy” has been recognized as a common complication of diabetes since the 1950s. Currently, diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the United States and other Western societies. It is also one of the most significant long-term complications in terms of morbidity and mortality for individual patients with diabetes. Diabetes is responsible for 30 to 40% of all end-stage renal disease (“ESRD”) cases in the United States. Proteinuria is a predictor of morbidity and mortality. Patients with proteinuria have a 40-fold higher relative mortality rate. Microalbuminuria, (small quantities of albumin in the urine) independently predicts cardiovascular morbidity, and spillage of the protein, albumin into the urine (or “microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria”) increase mortality from any cause in diabetes mellitus.
Diabetic Nephropathy Market
 
The total addressable market for disease-specific drug therapies for Diabetic Nephropathy has not been established because there are no approved drug therapies specific to the condition (please see the next section which discusses the current treatment limitations). Up to 50% of patients who have had diabetes for more than 20 years have diabetic nephropathy. It is estimated that up to 12 million people in the United States according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Current Diabetic Nephropathy Treatments and Limitations
 
High blood sugar, or “hyperglycemia”, has been shown to be a major determinant of the progression of diabetic nephropathy, so good blood glucose control is a key to management of the condition. As with other kidney diseases, there are no renal-specific drug therapies. Control of blood pressure using ACE inhibitors and ARBs is standard of care. New treatment guidelines recommend sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (“SGLT2”) inhibitors for patients with Type 2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (“eGFR”) ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at any level of current glycemic control. SGLT2 inhibitors have been proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in this population.
 
We believe there is a significant unmet need for effective diabetic nephropathy-specific treatments that can delay disease progression, prevent end-stage renal disease, and improve patients’ quality of life.

Anti-Inflammatory Biologics Market
 
The global anti-inflammatory biologics market was valued at $64.84 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $149.80 billion by 2027 according to Fortune Business Insights.
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
 
MS is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord, which occurs as a result of the immune system attacking the protective myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers, resulting in communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerves.
 
Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and the specific nerves are affected. Common symptoms include numbness or weakness in one or more limbs, electric-shock sensations with certain neck movements, tremor, lack of coordination, or unsteady gait. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. Vison problems are also common in patients with MS, including partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, prolonged double vision, or blurry vision. Other symptoms may include slurred speech, fatigue, dizziness, and tingling or pain in parts of the body. Significant disability occurs within 20 to 25 years in about 30% of patients.

MS Market
 
In 2019, U.S. disease modifying drugs for MS achieved $14.4 billion in sales according to a 2020 report by Cowan and Company. Based on current estimates, MS affects 1 million people in the United States and 2.8 million people worldwide, according to data from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, approximately 85% of patients with MS have relapsing-remitting MS, and experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. About 60% to 70% of people with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, known as secondary-progressive MS. Some people with MS experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses. This is known as primary-progressive MS.
 
Current MS Treatments and Limitations
 
Current treatment of MS includes immunomodulatory therapy (“IMT”) to address the underlying immune disorder and therapies to relieve or modify symptoms. The goal of IMT is to reduce the frequency of relapses and slow disease progression. Although there are numerous disease-modifying agents on the market, most have been approved for use only in relapsing forms of MS. There is only one FDA approved IMT for treatment of primary progressive MS. We believe there is a significant need for drugs that are effective in treating progressive MS, and we believe that IC 100 has potential to address this unmet need.
 
Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS)
 
ARDS is a life-threatening form of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy, diffuse abnormalities on chest radiographs, and decreased lung compliance. Patients require prolonged ICU stays and hospitalizations, consuming significant healthcare resources. Prognosis is poor with numerous complications, and high mortality; survivors have significant functional impairment for years following recovery. The most common causes of ARDS are COVID-19, pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, and sepsis.
 
ARDS Market
 
The total addressable drug therapy market for ARDS has not been established because drug therapy is currently not used for treatment (please see the next section which discusses the current treatment limitations).ARDS affects approximately 90,600 patients per year in the United States, with mortality up to 45% according to Quintanilla et al (2021 publication). Globally, ARDS accounts for 10% of intensive care unit admissions, representing more than 3 million patients with ARDS annually. While the incidence of ARDS does not differ by gender, it increases with advancing age.
 
Current ARDS Treatments and Limitations
 
There are no commercially available drug treatments for ARDS. Current treatment of ARDS is focused on the underlying condition, supportive care, noninvasive or mechanical ventilation using low tidal volumes, and conservative fluid management. We believe IC 200 has potential to treat the widespread inflammation pathogenic in ARDS.
 
Other Development Candidates
 
We continue to seek to identify and acquire commercialization rights to other technologies relating to renal and inflammatory diseases.

Manufacturing
 
We do not currently own or operate any facilities to formulate, manufacture, test, store, package or distribute VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we are developing or may seek to develop and do not currently have the capabilities to conduct such activities. We currently rely on third parties to manufacture, store and test VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we may seek to develop. We will depend on third-party suppliers and manufacturing organizations for all our required raw materials and drug substance and to formulate, manufacture, test, store, package and distribute clinical trial quantities of VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we may seek to develop. We plan to continue developing our network of third-party suppliers and manufacturing organizations, but in the future we may decide to consider investing in our own manufacturing and supply capabilities if there is a technical need or a strategic or financial benefit.
 
We have internal personnel and utilizes consultants with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturing and testing activities. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose procedural and documentation requirements, including, but not limited to, record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our systems, procedures and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations and are assessed through regular monitoring and formal audits.

Research and Development
 
We spent approximately $6.5 million on research and development activities in 2020, $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, and $5.4 million for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2022 through December 12, 2022 and $0.4 million for the Successor Period from December 13, 2022 through December 31 2022.
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. To commercialize any product that is approved for commercial sale, we must either develop our own sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have such commercial infrastructure and relevant marketing and sales experience. We expect to be able to build our commercial infrastructure over time in advance of any anticipated launch of our products, and we may rely on licensing, co-sale and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners for the commercialization of our products. If we establish the commercial infrastructure to support the potential marketing of VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we may seek to develop, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. In order to establish the proper commercial infrastructure, we would need to invest significant financial and management resources prior to any approval of VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we may seek to develop.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is highly competitive. These competitors include many public and private companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates that we seek to develop or address similar indications. Many competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market their products. We also expect that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products may increase over time. Competitive factors in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry include product efficacy, safety, ease of use, price, demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, service, reputation, and access to technical information. Any products that we develop and seek to commercialize may not be able to compete with the products of our competitors with respect to one or more of these considerations.
 
For instance, there are currently several other companies with drugs in clinical development for FSGS, targeting inflammation, fibrosis, and vasoconstriction. Among our competitors, there are products in various phases of development, including compounds in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of development. However, we believe that VAR 200 may be the only drug currently in development that addresses lipid accumulation in the glomerulus. The current treatment algorithm for renal disease includes multiple drug therapies to address the various pathways contributing to renal disease. We believe that VAR 200 could potentially be used in combination with other treatment modalities addressing other pathogenic pathways.
 
Additionally, there are a number of other companies developing drugs targeting the inflammasome pathway, some of which have clinical trials underway in multiple indications. Among these competitors, we are aware of a number of products in various stages of development, including those with Phase 2 clinical trials underway or completed, encompassing indications such as gout, Schnitzler’s Syndrome, COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome, corneal epithelial defects, dry/wet macular degeneration, diabetic retinal disease, and melanoma. Additionally, there are a number of Phase 1 clinical trials underway encompassing indications such as CAPS, mild COVID-19, systolic heart failure, and solid tumors, in addition to healthy subjects. We believe that IC 100 may be the only monoclonal antibody targeting the ASC component of the inflammasome, which can potentially inhibit multiple types of inflammasomes to prevent initiation and perpetuation of inflammation.

Intellectual Property
 
We seek to protect our products and technologies through a combination of patents, regulatory exclusivity, and proprietary know-how. Our goal is to obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods, and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current compositions and methods and any future compositions and methods under development, proprietary information, and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, where applicable, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. For additional information, see section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Pursuant to the L&F License Agreement, we have an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to the inventions relating to 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (“2HPβCD”) for the treatment of kidney disease in humans, including FSGS, as described in certain method-of-use patents and pending applications filed in the United States and selected foreign countries (Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and Mexico) from two international patent applications filed pursuant to the provisions of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”). Currently, there are 3 issued United States patents and 7 foreign granted or allowed applications. These patents, and any patents that issue from the pending applications, are anticipated to have a term to at least 2033, absent of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
Pursuant to the InflamaCORE License Agreement, we have an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to the inventions relating to recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory responses and inflammation mediated by inflammasomes and components thereof, including but not limited to IC 100 which is a humanized IgG4 antibody directed against a specific amino acid sequence of the pyrin domain of Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (“ASC”). The patent portfolio for IC 100 includes 5 patent families covering composition of matter, biomarker, and method-of-use patents and their related national stage filings in the United States and selected foreign countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam). Currently, there are 5 issued United States patents, 3 foreign granted or allowed applications and 56 pending applications. These patents, and any patents that issue from the pending applications, are anticipated to have a term at least 2028, absent of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
At this time, ZyVersa has no patents or patent applications outside of those connected to the L&F or InflamaCORE License Agreements.
 
Even though we have licensed issued patents, there is no guarantee that the validity of the patents will be upheld if challenged by a third party. There can be no assurance that any of our intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition.
 
On February 24, 2023, we filed two trademark applications for (1) Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ and (2) Lipid Efflux Mediator™ for pharmaceutical preparations for treatment of renal diseases and disorders. No other applications for trademark protection have been filed for any names or logos for products or technologies in development. We plan to seek trademark protection inside and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate. We intend to use these registered marks in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development, including proprietary technologies, as well as our product candidates.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products, biological products, and medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and other federal laws and regulations. These FDA-regulated products are also subject to state and local statutes and regulations, as well as applicable laws or regulations in foreign countries. The FDA, and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries, impose substantial requirements on the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, marketing, sampling and import and export of FDA-regulated products.

29
--

Government Regulation
 
Any product development activities related to VAR 200, IC 100, and any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or acquire in the future will be subject to extensive regulation by various government authorities, including the FDA and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, which regulate the design, research, clinical and non-clinical development, testing, manufacturing, storage, distribution, import, export, labeling, advertising and marketing of pharmaceutical products and devices. Generally, before a new drug can be sold, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. The data is often generated in two distinct development states: pre-clinical and clinical. VAR 200, IC 100, and any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or acquire in the future must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (“NDA”), Biologic Licensing Application (“BLA”) or other applicable approval process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
 
The clinical stages of development can generally be divided into three sequential phases that may overlap: Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. In Phase 1, generally, small numbers of healthy volunteers are exposed to single escalating doses and then multiple escalating doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected. In some instances, formal Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials may not be deemed necessary or required by the FDA. Such is often the case when the safety and efficacy of an API is considered to be well understood by the FDA. In Phase 3 studies, the drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. Under established regulatory pathways, pharmaceutical products with APIs equal or similar to those known by the FDA often enter more streamlined development programs than compounds entirely new to the agency.
 
Post-approval studies, sometime referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic condition or to gain additional indications for a medication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 studies.
 
Development of Drugs and Biological Products in the United States
 
In the United States, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawal from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
 
Prior to the start of human clinical studies for a new drug or biological product in the United States, pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests are often performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices regulations. The Sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data and literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application. Similar filings are required in other countries. The amount of data that must be supplied in the IND depends on the phase of the study. Phase 1 studies typically require less data than larger Phase 3 studies. A clinical plan must be submitted to the FDA prior to commencement of a clinical trial. If the FDA has concerns about the clinical plan or the safety of the proposed study, they may suspend or terminate the study at any time. Studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and regular reporting of study progress and any adverse experiences is required. Studies are also subject to review by independent institutional review boards responsible for overseeing studies at particular investigator sites and protecting human research study subjects. An independent institutional review board may also suspend or terminate a study once initiated. Accordingly, submission of an IND does not guarantee approval by the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or, once begun, that issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.

Review and Approval of Drugs and Biological Products in the United States
 
Following completion of Phase 3 trials, data from the trials are analyzed to determine safety and effectiveness. Complete development data is then filed with the FDA in a NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing and testing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. The NDA and BLA applications are the vehicle through which drug sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new pharmaceutical product for sale and marketing in the United States. The NDA or BLA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which entails extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The data gathered during the animal studies and human clinical trials of an IND become part of the NDA or BLA.
 
The review and evaluation of a NDA or BLA by the FDA may take several years to complete. The FDA may conduct pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements and may also audit data from clinical and pre-clinical trials.
 
The FDA may place conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to assure the safe use of the agent. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the Sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, which may include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
 
IND and Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biological Products
 
Prior to commencing a human clinical trial of a drug or biological product, an IND, which contains the results of preclinical studies along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during drug development.
 
An independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the investigational plan for the trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must be obtained from each trial subject.
 
Human clinical trials for drug and biological products typically are conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:
 

● | Phase I: The investigational drug/biologic is given initially to healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition in order to determine metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, side effects and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug/biologic’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase II: Clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug/biologic for a particular indication or in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug/biologic for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the Sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. 
● | Phase III: When Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug/biologic appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase III clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical sites may begin. They are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug/biologic and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites.

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, including good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements, which are intended to protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants, define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors and ensure clinical trial data integrity. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the Sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
 
During the development of a new drug or biologic, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II clinical trials, and before a NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the Sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the Sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end-of-Phase II clinical trials meetings to discuss their Phase II clinical trials results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug/biologic.
 
An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, biologics, and devices, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial, is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors also are obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the clinical trial results can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The New Drug Application (NDA) and Biologics License Application (BLA) Approval Processes
 
Our drug or biological products must be approved by the FDA through the NDA and BLA approval processes, respectively, before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. These FDA-required processes for drugs or biological products to be marketed in the U.S. generally involve the following:

● | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, in the case of a NDA, completion of animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practice or other applicable regulations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an IND application; 
● | performance of human clinical trials conducted in accordance with GCP to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for its intended use or uses; 
● | submission to the FDA of a NDA or BLA (as applicable) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
● | FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and audit of clinical trial sites; and 
● | FDA approval of a NDA or BLA, as applicable. 

 
In order to obtain approval to market a drug or biological product in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. The cost of preparing and submitting a NDA or BLA is substantial. Each NDA or BLA submission requires a user fee payment (exceeding $2.5 million in fiscal year 2019), unless a waiver or exemption applies. The manufacturer or sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual establishment fees. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies, or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other information. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.

Companies also must develop additional information about the characteristics of the drug or biological product and finalize a process for the NDA or BLA sponsor’s manufacturing the product in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the finished drug or biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
 
The results of drug or biological product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, tests conducted on the drug or biological product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs or BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a NDA or BLA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.
 
Once the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and BLA’s and seeks to review standard NDAs or BLAs within 12 months and prior review biologics within 8 months from submission of the respective applications. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA, it will issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully and generally follows such recommendations when making decisions.
 
Before approving a NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either the approval letter or the complete response letter. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, its complete response letter typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information, which may include additional large-scale clinical testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. This may significantly delay further review of the application.

If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP regulations, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA or BLA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue the approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in 2 or 6 months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy after a product is approved, including additional clinical trials and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. These so-called Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials may be a condition for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems or safety issues are identified following initial marketing.
 
The FDA also has authority to require a REMS to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA or BLA. Elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”), which is the most restrictive REMS. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA or BLA approval, and in some cases the approval date may be delayed. Once implemented, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, device components or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA, or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.
 
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products in development. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 
Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.

Patent Term Restoration
 
Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during drug development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the approval of that application, provided the Sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Orange Book Listing
 
In seeking approval for a drug through a NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed by the NDA holder in the drug’s application or otherwise are published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA permits marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under and ANDA are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant also may elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the thirty-month stay. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
Market Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain drug applications. The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For instance, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity (“NCE”). A drug is a NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The Hatch- Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of a NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant were deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, including, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three- year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDA for drugs that include the innovation that required the new clinical data, but does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA is required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Biosimilar Exclusivity
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). A biosimilar product or “biosimilar” is a biological product that is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from an existing FDA-licensed reference product. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior licensed product if it is biosimilar and meets additional requirements under the BPCIA, including that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. An interchangeable product may be substituted for the reference product without the involvement of the prescriber.
 
Under the BPCIA, no section 351(k) application for a biosimilar may be submitted for four (4) years from the date of licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a reference biologic is granted twelve (12) years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, During this twelve (12)-year exclusivity period, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product submitted under section 351(a) of the PHSA containing the competing sponsor’s own pre-clinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the other company’s product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product may obtain exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one (1) year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar; (ii) eighteen (18) months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge; (iii) eighteen (18) months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant; or (iv) forty-two (42) months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the forty-two (42)-month period.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
Fast Track Designation
 
Fast track designation may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. The sponsor of an investigational drug product may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. At the time of NDA filing, the FDA will determine whether to grant priority review designation. Additionally, fast track designation may be withdrawn if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

36
--

Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
The FDA may also accelerate the approval of a designated Breakthrough Therapy, which is a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The sponsor of a Breakthrough Therapy may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of a IND for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include (i) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; (ii) providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; (iii) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; (iv) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and (v) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
Accelerated Approval
 
Accelerated approval may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a rare disease for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Other benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA user fee.

Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, with certain exceptions.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity — patent or nonpatent — for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 
Post-Marketing FDA Regulations
 
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
 
The FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, which may include the following:
 

● | untitled letters or warning letters; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, disgorgement, restitution or civil penalties; 
● | injunctions (e.g., total or partial suspension of production) or consent decrees; 
● | product recalls, administrative detention, or seizure; 
● | customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds; 
● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | delays in or refusal to grant requests for future product approvals or foreign regulatory approvals of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products; 
● | withdrawals or suspensions of FDA product marketing approvals or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on product sales; 
● | clinical holds on clinical trials; 
● | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments to export products for sale in other countries; and 
● | criminal prosecution. 

 
Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotion materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), a part of the FDCA. Once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulations by the FDA. The FDA regulations require the products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP, and NDA or BLA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
 
NDA or BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms. These firms are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violations could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Newly-discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 
Healthcare and Reimbursement Regulation
 
If VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we seek to develop, are approved by the FDA, government coverage and reimbursement policies will both directly and indirectly affect our ability to successfully commercialize the product, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Many patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our products will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, to the extent they are reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. The market for our products will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies, or lists of products or treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Coverage and reimbursements for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. A third-party payors’ decision to provide coverage for a medical product or service does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or services, or to provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of or products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained.
 
In the United States and other potentially significant markets for VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we seek to develop, government authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. For example, third-party payors are attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, enacted in March 2010. In the future, there may be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States health care system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

Further, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, we, and our business activities, including but not limited to our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the False Claims Act, as amended, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, other healthcare fraud and abuse laws and similar state laws. Additionally, if an outpatient prescription drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
 
Other Regulatory Matters and Compliance Requirements
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair completion laws.
 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 
The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”— independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach.

Corruption Laws
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our anticipated non-U.S. operations and our anticipated expansion into additional countries outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
International Regulation of Drugs
 
Before we can market VAR 200, IC 100 and any other product candidate that we seek to develop, in any jurisdiction outside of the United States, we must obtain the necessary marketing authorizations in such jurisdiction. Many such jurisdictions require extensive safety and efficacy data similar to the data required by the FDA before granting marketing authorization. We may not be successful in obtaining marketing authorizations that we seek outside of the United States. If we are successful in obtaining marketing authorization in one jurisdiction, including the United States, that authorization does not ensure that we will receive marketing authorization in any other jurisdiction. The authorizations that are required to market a pharmaceutical product vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If we obtain marketing approval in any jurisdiction outside of the United States, we will be subject to ongoing regulation in such jurisdiction, consistent with the ongoing regulations to which we would be subject in the United States.
International Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
Certain non-U.S. laws, such as the GDPR govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, in Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws. Further, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from the EEA to the United States. For example, on June 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, declared the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, or the Privacy Shield, to be invalid. As a result, Privacy Shield is no longer a valid mechanism for transferring personal data from the EEA to the United States. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the standard contractual clauses will also be invalidated by the European courts or legislature, which seems possible given the rationale behind the CJEU’s concerns about U.S. law and practice on government surveillance. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Additionally, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union and the EEA, companies have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which exposes us to further compliance risk. In Canada, PIPEDA and similar provincial laws impose obligations on companies with respect to processing personal information, including health-related information, and provides individuals certain rights with respect to such information, including the right to access and challenge the accuracy of their personal information held by an organization. Failure to comply with PIPEDA could result in significant fines and penalties.
