ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
Organization and Offering 
 
Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. (‘‘Lightstone REIT III’’), is a Maryland corporation, formed on October 5, 2012, which elected to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2015.
 
Lightstone REIT III is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”).
 
Lightstone REIT III and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to the Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 
 
We have and will continue to seek to acquire a diverse portfolio of real estate assets and real estate-related investments, including hotels, other commercial and/or residential properties, primarily located in the United States. All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. We may also originate or acquire mortgage loans secured by real estate. Although we expect that most of our investments will be of these types, we may make other investments. In fact, we may invest in whatever types of real estate-related investments that we believe are in our best interests.
 
We currently have one operating segment. As of December 31, 2018, we majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of nine limited service hotels containing a total of 999 rooms. Additionally, we held a 22.5% membership interest in RP Maximus Cove, L.L.C. (the “Cove Joint Venture”) and a 50.0% joint venture ownership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the “Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture”), both of which we account for under the equity method of accounting.
 
Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC (the “Advisor”), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of the Lightstone Group, LLC. The Lightstone Group, LLC served as our sponsor (the ‘‘Sponsor’’) during our public offering which terminated on March 31, 2017. Subject to the oversight of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), the Advisor has primary responsibility for making investment decisions and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner of the Advisor and the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Special Limited Partner”), which has subordinated participation interests (“Subordinated Participation Interests”) in the Operating Partnership. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT III or the Operating Partnership.
 
We do not have employees. We depend substantially on our Advisor, which generally has responsibility for our day-to-day operations. Under the terms of the advisory agreement, the Advisor also undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to present to us investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives as adopted by our Board of Directors.

The Company’s registration statement on Form S-11 (the “Offering”), pursuant to which it offered to sell up to 30,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which may be referred to herein as ‘‘shares of common stock’’ or as ‘‘Common Shares’’) at an initial price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts (the “Primary Offering”) (exclusive of 10,000,000 shares which were available pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) at an initial purchase price of $9.50 per share) was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933 on July 15, 2014.
 
Orchard Securities, LLC (the ‘‘Dealer Manager’’) served as the dealer manager of the Offering through its termination on March 31, 2017.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Advisor owned 20,000 shares of common stock which were issued on December 24, 2012 for $200,000, or $10.00 per share.
 
The Offering, which terminated on March 31, 2017, raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $131.7 million from the sale of approximately 13.4 million shares of common stock (including $2.0 million in Common Shares at a purchase price of $9.00 per Common Share to an entity 100% owned by David Lichtenstein, who also owns a majority interest in the Company’s Sponsor). After including the purchase of an aggregate of $12.1 million of Subordinated Participation Interests by the Special Limited Partner and allowing for the payment of approximately $12.2 million in selling commissions and dealer manager fees and $4.8 million in organization and other offering expenses, the Offering generated aggregate net proceeds of approximately $126.8 million.
 
On April 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the termination of the DRIP effective May 15, 2017. Previously, our stockholders had an option to elect the receipt of shares of our common stock in lieu of cash distributions under the Company’s DRIP. As a result, all subsequent distributions have been in the form of cash. Through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP), we issued approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock under the DRIP, representing approximately $3.2 million of additional proceeds under the Offering.
 
The Company invested the proceeds received from the Offering and the Advisor in the Operating Partnership, and as a result, held a 99% general partnership interest as of December 31, 2018 in the Operating Partnership’s common units.
 
The Company’s shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The Company may seek to list its shares of common stock for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of its independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Company does not intend to list its shares of common stock at this time. The Company does not anticipate that there would be any market for its shares of common stock until they are listed for trading. In the event the Company does not begin the process of achieving a liquidity event prior to the eighth anniversary (March 31, 2025) of the termination of our Offering, our charter requires either (a) an amendment to our charter to extend the deadline to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event, or (b) the holding of a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio.
 
 Noncontrolling Interest – Partners of the Operating Partnership
 
On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed $2,000 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. A limited partner has the right to convert operating partnership units into cash or, at our option, an equal number of our common shares, as allowed by the limited partnership agreement.
 
In connection with our Offering, which terminated on March 31, 2017, the Special Limited Partner purchased an aggregate of 242 Subordinated Participation Interests for consideration of $12.1 million from the Operating Partnership. The Subordinated Participation Interests were each purchased for $50,000 in consideration and may be entitled to receive liquidation distributions upon the liquidation of Lightstone REIT III.
 
Operations - Operating Partnership Activity
 
Our Operating Partnership commenced its operations on December 11, 2014. Since then we have and will continue to seek to primarily acquire and operate hospitality properties and to a lesser extent, other commercial and residential properties principally in North America through our Operating Partnership. Our commercial holdings may consist of full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels and to a lesser extent, retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), industrial and office properties. All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. In addition, we may invest up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly.

Related Parties
 
Our Advisor and its affiliates and the Special Limited Partner are related parties of the Company. Certain of these entities have and/or will receive compensation for services related to the Offering (which was completed on March 31, 2017) and will continue to receive compensation and services for the investment, management and disposition of our assets. These entities have and/or will receive compensation during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages. The compensation levels during the offering stage were based on percentages of the offering proceeds raised and the compensation levels during the acquisition and operational stages are based the cost of acquired properties and the annual revenue earned from such properties, and other such fees outlined in each of the respective agreements.
Primary Business Objectives and Strategies
 
Our primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk.
 
Acquisition and Investment Policies
 
We have and/or intend to continue to primarily acquire commercial properties (including full-service or select-service hotels and extended-stay hotels) and residential real estate assets, as well as other real estate-related investments principally in North America. Our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities including restaurants, concierge and room service, porter service or valet parking. Select-service hotels typically do not include these amenities. Extended-stay hotels offer upscale, high-quality, residential style lodging with a comprehensive package of guest services and amenities for extended-stay business and leisure travelers. We have no limitation as to the brand of franchise or license with which our hotels are associated. We generally intend to hold each acquired property for a period of three to six years although we may hold our properties for differing timelines depending on various factors.

Even though we have and intend to continue primarily to acquire hotels, we have and may continue to purchase other types of real estate. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. We have and expect to invest mainly in direct real estate investments and other equity interests; however, we may also invest in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans, including in furtherance of a loan-to-own strategy. We have not established any limits on the percentage of our portfolio that may be comprised of various categories of assets which present differing levels of risk.
 
We have and may continue to enter into joint ventures, tenant-in-common investments or other co-ownership arrangements for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties with third parties or certain affiliates of our Advisor, including other present and future REITs and real estate limited partnerships sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor.
 
Financing Strategy and Policies
 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest or borrow for the purchase of any single asset. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total “net assets” (as defined in Section I.B of the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.
 
We do not currently intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. Careful use of debt will help us to achieve our diversification goals because we will have more funds available for investment. However, high levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors.
 
Distributions
 
On January 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized and we declared a distribution which is calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00164383 per day, and equals a daily amount that, if paid each day for a 365-day period, would equal a 6.0% annualized rate based on a share price of $10.00. Our first distribution began to accrue on December 11, 2014 (date of breaking escrow for our offering) through February 28, 2015 (the end of the month following our initial property acquisition) and subsequent distributions have been declared on a monthly basis thereafter. Our first distribution was paid on March 15, 2015 and subsequent distributions have been paid on or about the 15th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the prior month. However, there can be no assurances that our Board of Directors will authorize and we will declare future distributions at any particular level or frequency.
 
On April 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the termination of the DRIP effective May 15, 2017. Previously, our stockholders had an option to elect the receipt of shares of our common stock in lieu of cash distributions under the DRIP, however, all future distributions, if any, will be in the form of cash. In addition, through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP), we issued approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock under the DRIP, representing approximately $3.2 million of additional proceeds under the Offering.
 
Total distributions declared during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $8.1 million and $8.0 million.
 
Distribution Reinvestment and Share Repurchase Programs
 
On April 21, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the termination of our DRIP effective May 15, 2017. All future distributions, if any, will be in the form of cash.
 
Our DRIP provided our stockholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares of our common stock, at a discount by reinvesting their distributions. The Offering provided for 10.0 million shares available for issuance under our DRIP which were offered at a discounted price equivalent to 95% of our Primary Offering price per Common Share. Through May 15, 2017 (the termination date of the DRIP) 339,835 shares of common stock had been issued under our DRIP.
 
Our share repurchase program may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions. From inception through December 31, 2017, we repurchased 81,828 shares of common stock, pursuant to our share repurchase program. We repurchased the shares at an average price per share of $9.76 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 174,338 shares of common stock have been repurchased under our share repurchase program at an average price per share of $9.65 per share. We funded share repurchases for the periods noted above from the cumulative proceeds of the sale of our shares pursuant to our DRIP.

Our Board of Directors may amend the terms of our share repurchase program without stockholder approval upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders. Our Board of Directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program upon at least 30 days’ written notice to all stockholders or to reject any request for repurchase and there is no assurance our Board of Directors will not suspend or terminate the program or reject requests for repurchases.
 
Tax Status
 
We elected to qualify and be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
 
We engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). When we purchase a hotel we establish a TRS which enters into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we may be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
 
Competition
 
The hotel and other commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and rental revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We face competition from many sources. We face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels are located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry may increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we will not be associated.
 
We have or may compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
 
In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we will compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
 
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of proceeds from our Offering in desirable assets, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders.

We believe that our senior management’s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry enables us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.
 
Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the hospitality industry and any industries in which we operate to potentially offer existing property owners the opportunity to contribute properties to us in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we may a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.
 
Environmental
 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Employees
 
We do not have employees. We have entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate-related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We have and will continue to pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we have and will continue to reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.
Economic Dependence
 
We were initially dependent upon the net proceeds received from our Offering to conduct our proposed activities. The capital required to acquire additional future real estate and real estate related investments are expected to be obtained from the proceeds from asset sales and/or from any financings.
Available Information
 
We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, and proxy statements, with the SEC.
