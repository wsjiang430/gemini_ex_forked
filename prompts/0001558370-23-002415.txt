Item 1.    Business
Except as otherwise indicated, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refer to Stellus Capital Investment Corporation; and “Stellus Capital Management,” the “Advisor” or the “Administrator” refer to our investment adviser and administrator, Stellus Capital Management, LLC.
General
We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). We were organized as a Maryland corporation on May 8, 2012, and formally commenced operations on November 7, 2012. We originate and invest primarily in private middle-market companies (typically those with $5 million to $50 million of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)) through first lien (including unitranche), second lien, and unsecured debt financing, often with corresponding equity co-investments. Unitranche structures may combine characteristics of first lien senior secured as well as second lien and/or subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the “last-out” tranche. Unsecured debt includes senior unsecured and subordinated loans.
Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management, an investment advisory firm led by Robert T. Ladd and its other senior investment professionals. We source investments primarily through the extensive network of relationships that the senior investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have developed with financial sponsor firms, financial institutions, middle-market companies, management teams and other professional intermediaries. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies will not be rated by national rating agencies. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating that is often referred to as “junk.”
Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation. We seek to achieve our investment objective by:

● | accessing the extensive origination channels that have been developed and established by the Stellus Capital Management senior investment professionals that include long-standing relationships with private equity firms, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial services firms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | investing in what we believe to be companies with strong business fundamentals, generally within our core middle-market company focus;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | focusing on a variety of industry sectors, including business services, energy, general industrial, government services, healthcare, software and specialty finance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | focusing primarily on directly originated transactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | applying the disciplined underwriting standards that the Stellus Capital Management senior investment professionals have developed over their extensive investing careers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capitalizing upon the experience and resources of the Stellus Capital Management investment team to monitor our investments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On May 9, 2022, the Company received an exemptive order (the “Order”) from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that superseded the prior co-investment exemptive relief orders granted to us by the SEC that permits us to co-invest with additional types of private funds, other BDCs, and registered investment companies managed by Stellus Capital Management or an adviser that is controlled, controlling, or under common control with 

1



Stellus Capital Management , subject to the conditions included therein. Additionally, the Order provided added relief which allows the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company .Pursuant to the Order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company’s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company’s stockholders and is consistent with its investment objectives and strategies. We co-invest, subject to the conditions in the Order, with private credit funds managed by Stellus Capital Management that have an investment strategy that is similar or identical to our investment strategy, and the we may co-invest with other BDCs and registered investment companies managed by Stellus Capital Management or an adviser that is controlled, controlling, or under common control with Stellus Capital Management in the future. We believe that such co-investments may afford it additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification.
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in “eligible portfolio companies.” Under the relevant SEC rules, the term “eligible portfolio company” includes all private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States.
We have elected, qualified, and intend to continue to qualify annually to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any income we timely distribute to our stockholders.
Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a BDC that has satisfied certain requirements, to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% of our gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. As of December 31, 2022, our asset coverage ratio was 192%. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.
Our principal executive office is currently located at 4400 Post Oak Parkway, Suite 2200, Houston, TX 77027, and our telephone number is (713) 292-5400. We maintain a website on the Internet at www.stelluscapital.com (under the “Public Investors” section). Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and you should not consider information contained on our website to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SBIC Licenses





Two of our wholly owned subsidiaries Stellus Capital SBIC LP and Stellus Capital SBIC II LP (together, the “SBIC subsidiaries” and individually, the “SBIC I subsidiary” and “SBIC II subsidiary,” respectively) hold a license to operate as small business investment companies (“SBICs”). Current U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) regulations allow a single SBIC to obtain leverage by issuing debentures guaranteed by the SBA up to a maximum of $175 million under current SBIC regulations, subject to required capitalization of the SBIC subsidiary, SBA approval, and other requirements. The maximum leverage available to a “family” of SBIC funds is $350.0 million, subject to SBA approval. SBA-guaranteed debentures have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre-paid at any time with no prepayment penalty. We believe that the SBA-guaranteed debentures are an attractive source of debt capital.

2



We have obtained exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of the SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from our asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $325.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.
COVID-19 Developments
The effect on the U.S. and global economy of the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also referred to as “COVID-19” or “Coronavirus”), uncertainty relating to new variants of the Coronavirus that have emerged in the United States and globally, vaccine distribution, hesitancy and efficacy, the length of economic recovery, and policies of the U.S. presidential administration have created stress on the market and could affect our portfolio companies. Each portfolio company has been assessed on an individual basis to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the valuation of our investments in such company. We believe that any such COVID-19 pandemic impacts have been reflected in the valuation of our investments.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial performance of our current and future investments will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, related advisories and restrictions, and the health of the financial markets and economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent our portfolio companies are adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may have a material adverse impact on our future net investment income, the fair value of our portfolio investments and our financial condition.
Summary Risk Factors
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, including, but not limited to, the following risks:

● | The capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. Such market conditions may materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations..
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are dependent upon key personnel of Stellus Capital Management for our future success. If Stellus Capital Management were to lose any of its key personnel, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships. Any inability of Stellus Capital Management to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our incentive fee may induce Stellus Capital Management to make speculative investments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may be obligated to pay Stellus Capital Management incentive compensation even if we incur a loss and may pay more than 20.0% of our net capital gains because we cannot recover payments made in previous years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates and may default under our revolving credit facility if we are unable to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before, or without, receiving cash representing such income.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because we finance our investments with borrowed money, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3




● | Substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests under the Credit Facility (as defined below) or claims of the SBA with respect to SBA-guaranteed debentures we may issue and, if we default on our obligations thereunder, we may suffer adverse consequences, including foreclosure on our assets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Most of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors (the “Board”) and, as a result, there may be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any failure to comply with SBA regulations could have an adverse effect on our SBIC subsidiaries’ operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders to obtain and maintain our status as a RIC, we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth. If additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms, our ability to grow may be impaired.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The time and resources that Stellus Capital Management devote to us may be diverted, and we may face additional competition due to the fact that Stellus Capital Management and its affiliates are not prohibited from raising money for, or managing, another entity that makes the same types of investments that we target.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could violate the 1940 Act provisions applicable to BDCs or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The failure in cyber security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning, could impair our ability to conduct business effectively.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our investments in private and middle-market portfolio companies are risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets may adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our net asset value through increased net unrealized depreciation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The interest rates of our floating-rate loans to our portfolio companies might be subject to change based on recent regulatory changes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio Composition
Our investments generally range in size from $5 million to $30 million, and we may also selectively invest in larger positions. We generally expect that the size of our positions will increase in proportion to the size of our capital base. Pending such investments, we may reduce our outstanding indebtedness or invest in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments with a maturity of one year or less. In the future, we may adjust opportunistically the percentage of our assets held in various types of loans, our principal loan sources and the industries to which we have greatest exposure, based on market conditions, the credit cycle, available financing and our desired risk/return profile.

The following table provides a summary of our portfolio investments as of December 31, 2022:

(a) | As of December 31, 2022, $763.8 million of our debt investments at fair value were at floating interest rates, which represented approximately 97% of our total portfolio of debt investments at fair value. As of December 31, 2022, $21.9 million of our debt investments at fair value were at fixed interest rates, which represented approximately 3% of our total portfolio of debt investments at fair value.

(c) | The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2022 was approximately 11.1%, of which approximately 10.3% was current cash interest. The weighted average yield on all of our investments, including non-income producing equity positions, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was approximately 10.4% and 7.5%, respectively. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries’ fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, which represents the interest rate on our debt investments restated as an interest rate payable annually in arrears and is computed including cash and payment in kind, or Payment-In-Kind (“PIK”) interest, as well as accretion of original issue discount. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.

Stellus Capital Management
Stellus Capital Management manages our investment activities and is responsible for analyzing investment opportunities, conducting research and performing due diligence on potential investments, negotiating and structuring our investments, originating prospective investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.
The senior investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have an average of over 34 years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience and have worked together at several companies. The Stellus Capital Management senior investment professionals have a wide range of experience in middle-market investing, including originating, structuring and managing loans and debt securities through market cycles. The Stellus Capital Management senior investment professionals continue to provide investment sub-advisory services to the D. E. Shaw & Co., L.P. and its associated investment funds (the “D.E. Shaw group”).
In addition to serving as our investment adviser and the sub-advisor to the D. E. Shaw group as noted above, Stellus Capital Management currently manages private credit funds, some of which have an investment strategy that is similar or identical to our investment strategy. We received the Order from the SEC, which permits us to co-invest with investment funds managed by Stellus Capital Management or an adviser that is controlled, controlling, or under common control with Stellus Capital Management, where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC). We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification. In addition, we will not co-invest with D.E. Shaw group funds.

Stellus Capital Management is headquartered in Houston, Texas, and also maintains offices in the Washington, D.C. area and Charlotte, North Carolina.
Market Opportunity
We originate and invest primarily in private middle-market companies through first lien (including unitranche), second lien and unsecured debt financing, often with corresponding equity co-investments. We believe the environment for investing in middle-market companies is attractive for several reasons, including:
Robust Demand for Debt Capital
We believe that private equity firms have significant committed but uncalled capital, a large portion of which is still available for investment in the United States. We expect the large amount of uninvested capital commitments will drive buyout activity over the next several years, which should, in turn, create lending opportunities for us.
Attractive Environment to Lend To Middle-Market Companies
The current strength of the U.S. economy provides an attractive environment to lend to middle-market companies. The U.S. services, healthcare, technology and consumer products sectors continue to show strong growth and profitability, allowing middle market companies to continue to service their debt and prudently borrow to support growth initiatives and mergers and acquisitions activity. This dynamism, coupled with ample capital from private equity firms to support middle market companies, is creating a large population of credit worthy companies looking for debt capital.
Attractive Deal Pricing and Structures
We believe that the pricing of middle-market debt investments is higher, and the terms of such investments are more conservative, compared to larger liquid, public debt financings, due to the more limited universe of lenders as well as the highly negotiated nature of these financings. These transactions tend to offer stronger covenant packages, higher interest rates, lower leverage levels and better call protection compared to larger financings. In addition, middle-market loans typically offer other investor protections such as default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and information rights for lenders.
Specialized Lending Requirements
Lending to middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, restructuring experience and active portfolio management. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of Stellus Capital Management’s senior investment professionals, lending to middle-market companies in the United States (a) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of the information available with respect to such companies, (b) requires specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, and (c) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. We believe that, through Stellus Capital Management, we have the experience and expertise to meet these specialized lending requirements.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to achieve positive returns for our investors:
Experienced Investment Team
Through our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management, we have access to the experience and expertise of the Stellus Capital Management senior investment professionals, including its senior investment professionals who have an average of over 34 years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience and have worked together at several companies. The Stellus Capital Management investment professionals have a wide range of experience in middle-market investing, including originating, structuring and managing debt and equity securities

through market cycles. We believe the members of Stellus Capital Management’s senior investment team are proven and experienced, with extensive capabilities in credit investing, having participated in these markets for the predominant portion of their careers. We believe that these characteristics enhance the quantity and quality of investment opportunities available to us.
Established, Rigorous Investment and Monitoring Process
The Stellus Capital Management investment professionals have developed an extensive review and credit analysis process. Each investment that is reviewed by Stellus Capital Management is brought through a structured, multi-stage approval process. In addition, Stellus Capital Management takes an active approach in monitoring all investments, including reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and regular discussions with management. Stellus Capital Management’s investment and monitoring process and the depth and experience of its investment professionals should allow it to conduct the type of due diligence and monitoring that enables it to identify and evaluate risks and opportunities.
Demonstrated Ability to Structure Investments Creatively
Stellus Capital Management has the expertise and ability to structure investments across all levels of a company’s capital structure. Furthermore, we believe that current market conditions will allow us to structure attractively priced debt investments and may allow us to incorporate other return-enhancing mechanisms such as commitment fees, original issue discounts, early redemption premiums, PIK, interest and various forms of equity securities.
Resources of Stellus Capital Management Platform
We have access to the resources and capabilities of Stellus Capital Management, which has 17 investment professionals, including Robert T. Ladd, Dean D’Angelo, and Joshua T. Davis, who are supported by five managing directors, four vice presidents and four analysts. These individuals have developed long-term relationships with middle-market companies, management teams, financial sponsors, lending institutions and deal intermediaries by providing flexible financing throughout the capital structure. We believe that these relationships provide us with a competitive advantage in identifying investment opportunities in our target market. We also expect to benefit from Stellus Capital Management’s due diligence, credit analysis, origination and transaction execution experience and capabilities, including the support provided with respect to those functions by Mr. Huskinson, who serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, and his staff of nine finance and operations professionals.
Investment Strategy
The Stellus Capital Management senior investment professionals employ an opportunistic and flexible investing approach, combined with strong risk management processes, which we believe yields a highly diversified portfolio across companies, geographies, industries, and investment types. We seek direct origination opportunities of first lien (including unitranche), second lien, and unsecured debt financing, often with corresponding equity co-investments, in middle-market companies. We believe that businesses in this size range often have limited access to public financial markets, and will benefit from Stellus Capital Management’s reliable lending approach. Many financing providers have chosen to focus on large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. Further, many financial institutions and traditional lenders are faced with constrained balance sheets and are requiring existing borrowers to reduce leverage.
With an average of over 34 years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience, the senior investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have demonstrated investment expertise throughout the balance sheet and in a variety of situations, including financial sponsor buyouts, growth capital, debt refinancing, balance sheet recapitalizations, rescue financings, distressed opportunities, and acquisition financings. Our investment philosophy emphasizes capital preservation through superior credit selection and risk mitigation. We expect our portfolio to provide downside protection through conservative cash flow and asset coverage requirements, priority in the capital structure and information requirements. We also anticipate benefiting from equity participation through 

7



equity co-investments. This flexible approach enables Stellus Capital Management to respond to market conditions and offer customized lending solutions.
Stellus Capital Management invests across a wide range of industries with deep expertise in select verticals including, but not limited to, business services, retail, general industrial, government services, healthcare, software and specialty finance. Our typical transactions include providing financing for leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations and growth opportunities. We seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of investments as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends. In addition, we co-invest with private credit funds managed by Stellus Capital Management that have a similar, overlapping or identical investment strategy as us and where doing so is consistent with conditions of the Order, and we may co-invest with other BDCs and registered investment companies managed by Stellus Capital Management or an adviser that is controlled, controlling, or under common control with Stellus Capital Management in the future.
Our objective is to act as the lead or largest investor in transactions, generally investing between $5 million and $30 million per transaction. We expect the average investment holding period to be between two and four years, depending upon portfolio company objectives and conditions in the capital markets.
We focus on middle-market companies with between $5 million and $50 million of EBITDA in a variety of industry sectors with positive long-term dynamics and dependable cash flows. We seek businesses with management teams with demonstrated track records and economic incentives in strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages with dependable and predictable cash flows.
We employ leverage prudently and within the limitations of the applicable laws and regulations for BDCs. Any decision on our part to use leverage will depend upon our assessment of the attractiveness of available investment opportunities in relation to the costs and perceived risks of such leverage.
Transaction Sourcing
As access to investment opportunities is highly relationship-driven, the senior investment team and other investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management spend considerable time developing and maintaining contacts with key deal sources, including private equity firms, investment banks and senior lenders. The senior investment team and other investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have been actively investing in the middle-market for more than a decade and have focused on extensive calling and marketing efforts via speaking engagements, sponsorships, industry events and referrals to broaden their relationship network. Existing relationships are constantly cultivated through transactional work and other personal contacts.
In addition to financial sponsors, Stellus Capital Management has developed a network of other deal sources, including:

● | management teams and entrepreneurs;
--+------------------------------------


● | portfolio companies of private equity firms;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | other investment firms that have similar strategies to Stellus Capital Management and are seeking co-investors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | placement agents and investment banks representing financial sponsors and issuers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corporate operating advisers and other financial advisers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | consultants, attorneys and other service providers to middle-market companies and financial sponsors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that Stellus Capital Management’s broad network of deal origination contacts will afford us with a continuous source of investment opportunities.

8



These origination relationships provide access not only to potential investment opportunities but also to market intelligence on trends across the credit markets. Since inception, Stellus Capital Management has completed financing transactions with more than 150 equity sponsors and completed multiple financing transactions with 33 of those equity sponsors.
We believe that, over the past decade, the senior investment team and other investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management have built a reputation as a thoughtful and disciplined provider of capital to middle-market companies and a preferred financing source for private equity sponsors and management teams. We believe these factors give Stellus Capital Management a competitive advantage in sourcing investment opportunities, which are put to use for our benefit.
Investment Structuring
Stellus Capital Management believes that each investment has unique characteristics that must be considered, understood and analyzed. Stellus Capital Management structures investment terms based on the business, the credit profile, the outlook for the industry in which a potential portfolio company operates, the competitive landscape, the products or services which the company sells and the management team and ownership of the company, among other factors. Stellus Capital Management relies upon the analysis conducted and information gathered through the investment process to evaluate the appropriate structure for our investments.
We invest primarily in the debt securities of middle-market companies. Our investments typically carry a high level of cash pay interest and may incorporate other return-enhancing mechanisms such as commitment fees, original issue discounts, early redemption premiums, PIK interest and some form of equity participation, including preferred stock, common stock, warrants and other forms of equity participation. We expect that a typical debt investment in which we invest will have a term at origination of between five and seven years. We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company.
Stellus Capital Management negotiates covenants in connection with debt investments that provide protection for us but allow appropriate flexibility for the portfolio company. Such covenants may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection and change of control provisions. Stellus Capital Management requires comprehensive information rights including access to management, financial statements and budgets and, in some cases, membership on the portfolio company’s board of directors or board observation rights. Additionally, Stellus Capital Management generally requires financial covenants and terms that restrict an issuer’s use of leverage and limitations on asset sales and capital expenditures.
Secured Debt
Secured debt, including first lien (including unitranche) and second lien financing, has liens on the assets of the borrower that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans.
First Lien Debt First lien debt is structured with first-priority liens on the assets of the borrower that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. First lien loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity.
Unitranche Debt Unitranche debt typically is structured as first lien loans that combine both senior and junior debt with lenders agreeing separately to an order of priority among them. To the extent that we invest in the “last out” tranche of a unitranche facility, our unitranche investments will have certain risk characteristics of second lien debt. Unitranche debt typically provides for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the debt, with the majority of the principal payment deferred until loan maturity. Since unitranche debt generally allows the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In some cases, we will be the sole lender, or we together with our affiliates will be the sole lender, of unitranche debt, which can provide us with more influence interacting with a borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediation in the event of underperformance.

9



Second Lien Debt Second lien debt is structured as junior, secured loans with second priority liens on an issuer’s assets. These loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity.
Unsecured Debt
Unsecured debt, including senior unsecured and subordinated loans, is not secured by any collateral and is effectively subordinated to the borrower’s secured indebtedness (to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness), including pursuant to one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with holders of a borrower’s senior debt.
Senior Unsecured Loans Senior unsecured loans are structured as loans that rank senior in right of payment to any of the borrower’s unsecured indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to such loans. These loans generally provide for fixed interest rates and amortize evenly over the term of the loan. Senior unsecured loans are generally less volatile than subordinated loans due to their priority over subordinated loans.
Subordinated Loans Subordinated loans are structured as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and PIK interest) in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to maturity. Subordinated loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. Subordinated loans are generally more volatile than secured loans and senior unsecured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal as compared to other types of loans. Subordinated loans often include a PIK feature, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, thereby increasing credit risk exposure over the life of the loan.
Equity Securities
In connection with some of our debt investments, we may also invest in preferred or common stock or receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy an equity interest in the portfolio company. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure such equity investments and warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a “put,” or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights.
Investment Process
Through the resources of Stellus Capital Management, we have access to significant research resources, experienced investment professionals, internal information systems and a credit analysis framework and investment process. Stellus Capital Management has designed a highly involved and interactive investment management process, which is the core of its culture and the basis for what we believe is a strong track record of investment returns. The investment process seeks to select only those investments that it believes have the most attractive risk/reward characteristics. The process involves several levels of review and is coordinated in an effort to identify risks in potential investments. Stellus Capital Management applies its expertise to screen our investment opportunities as described below. This rigorous process, combined with our broad origination capabilities, has allowed the Stellus Capital Management team to be prudent in selecting opportunities in which to make an investment.
All potential investment opportunities undergo an initial informal review by Stellus Capital Management’s investment professionals. Each potential investment opportunity that an investment professional determines merits consideration is presented and evaluated at a weekly meeting during which Stellus Capital Management’s senior investment professionals discuss the merits and risks of a potential investment opportunity as well as the due diligence process and the pricing and structure. If Stellus Capital Management’s senior investment professionals believe an investment opportunity merits further review, the investment opportunity is assigned a deal team and the deal team 

10



prepares and presents to the investment committee for initial review a prescreen memorandum that generally describes the potential transaction and includes a description of the risks, due diligence process and proposed structure and pricing for the proposed investment opportunity.
Prior to making an investment, Stellus Capital Management conducts rigorous diligence on each investment opportunity. In connection with its due diligence on a potential investment opportunity, Stellus Capital Management utilizes its internal diligence resources, which include its internally developed credit analytical framework, subscriptions to third party research resources, discussions with industry experts, internal information sharing systems and the analytical expertise of its investment professionals. Stellus Capital Management typically reviews the company’s historical financials; industry drivers and outlook, competitive threats, customer concentration, asset coverage, projected financials and credit metrics; management background checks; and, if applicable, the track record and funding capabilities of the private equity sponsor.
Upon review of the prescreen memorandum, if the investment committee determines to proceed with the review of an investment opportunity, the deal team continues its diligence and deal structuring plans and prepares a credit approval memorandum for review by the investment committee. The credit approval memorandum updates the prescreen memorandum with more deal specific detail, including an update to the diligence process and any changes in the structure and pricing of the proposed investment.
Investment Committee





Each new investment opportunity must be unanimously approved by Stellus Capital Management’s investment committee. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies also require the investment committee’s unanimous approval. Stellus Capital Management’s Chief Investment Officer, Robert T. Ladd, reviews any amendments before finalizing and closing negotiations with the prospective portfolio company. The purpose of Stellus Capital Management’s investment committee is to evaluate and approve all of our investments, subject at all times to the oversight of our Board. The investment committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committee’s members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. The investment committee consists of Robert T. Ladd, Dean D’Angelo, Joshua T. Davis, Todd A. Overbergen and W. Todd Huskinson. The investment committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements.
In addition to reviewing investments, investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flow are reviewed on a regular basis. Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credits with the investment committee early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently.
Each member of the investment committee performs a similar role for other accounts managed by Stellus Capital Management. In certain instances, including in connection with co-investments under the Order, approval by our Board may also be required prior to the making of an investment.
Monitoring Investments
In most cases, we do not have board influence over our portfolio companies. In some instances, Stellus Capital Management’s senior investment professionals may obtain board representation or observation rights in conjunction with our investments. Stellus Capital Management takes an active approach in monitoring all investments, including reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and regular discussions with management. The monitoring process begins with structuring terms and conditions, which require the timely delivery and access to critical financial and business information on portfolio companies.
Specifically, Stellus Capital Management’s monitoring system consists of the following activities:
Regular Investment Committee Updates Key portfolio company developments are discussed each week as part of the standard investment committee meeting agenda.

11



Written Reports The deal teams provide periodic written updates as appropriate for key events that impact portfolio company performance or valuation. In addition, deal teams provide written updates following each portfolio company board meeting.
Quarterly Full Portfolio Review Stellus Capital Management’s Chief Investment Officer and our Chief Compliance Officer perform a quarterly comprehensive review of every portfolio company with the deal teams. This process includes a written performance and valuation update, and credit-specific discussion on each of our portfolio companies. In addition, pursuant to our valuation policy, the valuation of each portfolio investment for which a market quotation is not readily available is reviewed by our independent third-party valuation firm at least twice annually. In addition, portfolio investments that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board based on the input of our Stellus Capital Management’s investment professionals and our Board’s audit committee.

As part of the monitoring process, Stellus Capital Management also tracks developments in the broader marketplace. Stellus Capital Management’s investment professionals have a wealth of information on the competitive landscape, industry trends, relative valuation metrics, and analyses that assist in the execution of our investment strategy. In addition, Stellus Capital Management’s extensive communications with brokers and dealers allows its investment professionals to monitor market and industry trends that could affect portfolio investments. Stellus Capital Management may provide ongoing strategic, financial and operational guidance to some portfolio companies either directly or by recommending its investment professionals or other experienced representatives to participate on the portfolio company’s board of directors. Stellus Capital Management maintains an extensive network of strategic and operational advisers to call upon for industry expertise or to supplement existing management teams.
Asset Quality
In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Stellus Capital Management uses an investment ranking system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment ranking system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category:
Investment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment.
Investment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2.
Investment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants.
Investment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of contractual return but no loss of principal is expected.
Investment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.
In the event that Stellus Capital Management determines that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, Stellus Capital Management will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. While the investment ranking system identifies the relative risk for each investment, the ranking alone does not dictate the scope and/or frequency of any monitoring that is performed. The frequency of Stellus Capital Management’s monitoring of an investment is 

12



determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the trends in the financial performance of the portfolio company, the investment structure and the type of collateral securing the investment.
Determination of Net Asset Value and Portfolio Valuation Process
The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding.
In December 2020, the SEC adopted a new rule providing a framework for fund valuation practices. Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act (“Rule 2a-5”) establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Rule 2a-5 permits boards, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions, to designate certain parties to perform fair value determinations. Rule 2a-5 also defines when market quotations are “readily available” for purposes of the 1940 Act and the threshold for determining whether a fund must determine the fair value of a security. The SEC also adopted new Rule 31a-4 under the 1940 Act (“Rule 31a-4”), which provides the recordkeeping requirements associated with fair value determinations. Finally, the SEC is rescinding previously issued guidance on related issues, including the role of the board in determining fair value and the accounting and auditing of fund investments. Rule 2a-5 and Rule 31a-4 became effective on March 8, 2021, and have a compliance date of September 8, 2022. While our Board has not elected to designate Stellus Capital Management as the valuation designee, we have adopted certain revisions to our valuation policies and procedures in order comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 2a-5 and Rule 31a-4.
​
As a BDC, we will generally invest in illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of private middle-market companies. Section 2(a)(41)of the 1940 Act requires that a BDC value its assets as follows: (i) the third party price for securities for which a quotation is readily available; and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value, as determined in good faith by a BDC's board.
​
In calculating the value of our total assets, investment transactions will be recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses will be computed using the specific identification method. 
​
Under procedures established by our Board, we intend to value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. The Company will obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the midpoint of the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. We also engage independent valuation providers to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation at least twice annually.

​
Debt and equity investments purchased within approximately 90 days of the valuation date will be valued at cost, plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value. With respect to unquoted securities, our Board will value each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board will use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market quotation for many of the investments in our portfolio, the Company expects to value most of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the valuations currently assigned.
​
We also have adopted Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”). This accounting statement requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is assumed to be sold in the principal market to market participants, or in the absence of a principal market, 

13



the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the market in which we can exit portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level activity is considered our principal market.
​
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

● | our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management responsible for the portfolio investment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior investment professionals and Stellus Capital Management;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at least twice annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the audit committee of our Board then reviews these preliminary valuations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Board then discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of Stellus Capital Management’s investment professionals, the independent valuation firm and the audit committee of the Board.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In following these approaches, the types of factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant, but are not limited to:

● | available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | applicable market yields and multiples;
--+----------------------------------------


● | financial covenants;
--+---------------------


● | call protection provisions;
--+----------------------------


● | information rights;
--+--------------------


● | the nature and realizable value of any collateral;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets in which it does business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the principal market and enterprise values.
--+--------------------------------------------

Realization of Investments
The potential exit scenarios of a portfolio company play an important role in evaluating investment decisions. Our debt-orientation provides for increased potential exit opportunities, including (a) the sale of investments in the private markets, (b) the refinancing of investments held, often due to maturity or recapitalizations, and (c) other liquidity events including the sale or merger of the portfolio company. Since we seek to maintain a debt orientation in our investments, 

14



we expect to receive interest income over the course of the investment period, resulting in a return on invested capital well in advance of final exit.
Derivatives
We may utilize hedging techniques such as interest rate swaps to mitigate potential interest rate risk on our indebtedness. Such interest rate swaps would principally be used to protect us against higher costs on our indebtedness resulting from increases in both short-term and long-term interest rates. We also may use various hedging and other risk management strategies to seek to manage various risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Such hedging strategies would be utilized to seek to protect the value of our portfolio investments, for example, against possible adverse changes in the market value of securities held in our portfolio.
Rule 18f-4 was recently adopted by the SEC, and requires BDCs that use derivatives to, among other things, comply with a value-at-risk leverage limit, adopt a derivatives risk management program, and implement certain testing and board reporting procedures. Rule 18f-4 exempts BDCs that qualify as “limited derivatives users” from the aforementioned requirements, provided that these BDCs adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the BDC’s derivatives risks and comply with certain recordkeeping requirements. The Company currently qualifies as a “limited derivatives user” and expects to continue to do so. The Company adopted a derivatives policy by Rule 18f-4’s August 2022 compliance date, and complies with the recordkeeping requirements.
Managerial Assistance
As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Stellus Capital Management or an affiliate of Stellus Capital Management provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse Stellus Capital Management or an affiliate of Stellus Capital Management for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review by our Board, including our independent directors.
Competition
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC.
We use the expertise of the investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the relationships of the investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we invest.
Employees
We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by Stellus Capital Management. We have a Chief Executive Officer and President and a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Treasurer and Secretary. To the extent necessary, we may hire additional personnel going forward. Our officers are employees of Stellus Capital Management and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and 

15



Chief Compliance Officer and his staff is paid by us pursuant to the administration agreement that we have entered into with Stellus Capital Management (the “Administration Agreement”).
Management Agreements
Stellus Capital Management serves as our investment adviser and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). In addition, Stellus Capital Management serves as our administrator.
Investment Advisory Agreement

Subject to the overall supervision of our Board and in accordance with the 1940 Act, Stellus Capital Management manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), Stellus Capital Management:

● | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay Stellus Capital Management a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are borne by our stockholders.
Management Fee

The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage (including preferred stock, public and private debt issuances, derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and other similar instruments or arrangements) and excluding cash and cash equivalents. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter are appropriately pro-rated.
Incentive Fee
We pay Stellus Capital Management an incentive fee. Incentive fees are calculated as below. The incentive fee, which provides Stellus Capital Management with a share of the income that it generates for us, has two components, ordinary income and capital gains, calculated as follows:
The ordinary income component is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a total return requirement, and deferral of non-cash amounts, and is 20.0% of the amount, if any, by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to our common stock, for the immediately preceding 

16



calendar quarter, exceeds a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a “catch-up” provision, for the benefit off Stellus Capital Management, measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, Stellus Capital Management receives no incentive fee until our pre-incentive fee net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 2.0%, but then receives, as a “catch-up,” 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%.
The effect of the “catch-up” provision is that, subject to the total return provision discussed below, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter, Stellus Capital Management receives 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as described below), and any interest expense and any distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. The foregoing incentive fee is subject to a total return requirement, which provides that no incentive fee in respect of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income will be payable except to the extent 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding quarters. In other words, any ordinary income incentive fee that is payable in a calendar quarter will be limited to the lesser of (i) 20.0% of the amount by which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such calendar quarter exceeds the 2.0% hurdle, subject to the “catch-up” provision, and (ii) (x) 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters minus (y) the cumulative incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the 11 preceding calendar quarters.
For the foregoing purpose, the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” is the amount, if positive, of the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters. In addition, the portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID) will be paid to Stellus Capital Management, without any interest thereon, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such amounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possible elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter, and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. Stellus Capital Management has agreed to permanently waive any interest accrued on the portion of the incentive fee attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or OID).
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss, subject to the total return requirement. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter.

17



The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:
Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)
Percentage of Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income
Allocated to Income-Related Portion of Incentive Fee
The capital gains component of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), is equal to 20.0% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from inception through the end of that calendar year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee.
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation
Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee before Total Return Requirement Calculation:
Alternative 1
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income — (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.6125%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee.
Alternative 2
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.4375% 
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
​

18



Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income — (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.2625%

Incentive fee | = 100% × Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to “catch-up”)(3)= 100% × (2.2625% — 2.0%)= 0.2625%
--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the “catch-up” provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.2625%.
Alternative 3
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income — (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.8625%
Incentive fee = 100% × Pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to “catch-up”)(3)Incentive fee = 100% × “catch-up” + (20.0% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income — 2.5%))

“Catch-up” | = 2.5% — 2.0%= 0.5%
-----------+--------------------


Incentive fee | = (100% × 0.5%) + (20.0% × (2.8625% — 2.5%))= 0.5% + (20.0% × 0.3625%)= 0.5% + 0.0725%= 0.5725%
--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the “catch-up” provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.5725%.


(1) | Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate.
----+----------------------------------------


(2) | Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee.
----+-------------------------------------------------


(3) | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide Stellus Capital Management with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any fiscal quarter.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2: Income Portion of Incentive Fee with Total Return Requirement Calculation:
Alternative 1:
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income — (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625%
Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000
​

19



20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding 11 calendar quarters = $8,000,000
Although our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% (as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above), no incentive fee is payable because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters did not exceed the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters.
Alternative 2:
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.0%
Management fee(2) = 0.4375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income — (management fee + other expenses) = 2.8625%
Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid for preceding 11 calendar quarters = $9,000,000
20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over current and preceding
11 calendar quarters = $10,000,000
Because our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate of 2.0% and because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the then current and 11 preceding calendar quarters exceeds the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid for the preceding 11 calendar quarters, an incentive fee would be payable, as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above.


(1) | Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate.
----+----------------------------------------


(2) | Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee.

Example 3: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee(*):
Alternative 1:
Assumptions
Year 1: $2.0 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $3.0 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”)
Year 2: Investment A sold for $5.0 million and fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B determined to be $3.5 million
Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $2.0 million
Year 4: Investment B sold for $3.25 million
The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:
Year 1: None
Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $0.6 million — ($3.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%)
Year 3: None — $0.4 million (20.0% multiplied by ($3.0 million cumulative capital gains less $1.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $0.6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2)
Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $50,000 — $0.65 million ($3.25 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $0.6 million (capital gains incentive fee taken in Year 2)
Alternative 2
Assumptions
Year 1: $2.0 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $5.25 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $4.5 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
Year 2: Investment A sold for $4.5 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $4.75 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $4.5 million
Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $5.0 million and Investment C sold for $5.5 million
Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $6.0 million
Year 5: Investment B sold for $4.0 million
The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be:
Year 1: None
Year 2: $0.4 million capital gains incentive fee — 20.0% multiplied by $2.0 million ($2.5 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $0.5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)

21



Year 3: $0.25 million capital gains incentive fee(1) — $0.65 million (20.0% multiplied by $3.25 million ($3.5 million cumulative realized capital gains less $0.25 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $0.4 million capital gains incentive fee received in Year 2
Year 4: $0.05 million capital gains incentive fee — $0.7 million ($3.50 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $0.65 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3
Year 5: None — $0.45 million (20.0% multiplied by $2.25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $3.5 million less realized capital losses of $1.25 million)) less $0.7 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4(2)

* | The hypothetical amounts of returns shown are based on a percentage of our total net assets and assume no leverage. There is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1) | As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 1 above, if a portfolio company were to be wound up on a date other than its fiscal year end of any year, it may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if such portfolio company had been wound up on its fiscal year end of such year.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by Stellus Capital Management ($0.70 million) is effectively greater than $0.45 million (20.0% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($2.25 million)).

Duration and Termination



Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of the independent directors. The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by Stellus Capital Management and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are dependent upon key personnel of Stellus Capital Management for our future success. If Stellus Capital Management were to lose any of its key personnel, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.
Indemnification



The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that Stellus Capital Management and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Stellus Capital Management’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. Our obligation to provide indemnification under the Investment Advisory Agreement, however, is limited by the 1940 Act and Investment Company Act Release No. 11330, which, among other things, prohibit us from indemnifying any director, officer or other individual from any liability resulting directly from the willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence in the performance of duties or reckless disregard of applicable obligations and duties of the directors, officers or other individuals and require us to set forth reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification shall be made.
Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement




Our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, approved the Investment Advisory Agreement at its first meeting, held on September 24, 2012, and approved the annual continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement on January 11, 2023 by virtual means in reliance on relief provided by the SEC in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a condition of the SEC's COVID-19 relief, our Board will be required to ratify the re-approval of the Investment Management Agreement at its next in-person meeting. In its consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board focused on information it had received relating to, among other things: (a) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by our investment adviser; (b) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives; (c) our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives; (d) any existing and potential sources of indirect income to our investment adviser from its relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships; (e) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; (f) the organizational capability and financial condition of our investment adviser; and (g) various other factors.
In voting to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board, including all of the directors who are not “interested persons,” of the Company, made the following conclusions:

● | Nature, Extent and Quality of Services. Our Board considered the nature, extent and quality of the advisory and other services to be provided by Stellus Capital Management, including the investment performance of Stellus Capital Management’s investment team. Our Board also considered the investment selection process expected to be employed by Stellus Capital Management, including the flow of transaction opportunities resulting from its investment team’s significant experience in originating, structuring and managing loans and debt securities through market cycles; the employment of Stellus Capital Management’s investment strategy, rigorous due diligence process, investment structuring, and ongoing relationships with and monitoring of portfolio companies, in light of the investment objective of the Company. Our Board also considered Stellus Capital Management’s personnel and their prior experience in connection with the types of investments made by us,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




including such personnel’s corporate relationships and relationships with private equity firms, investment banks, restructuring advisors, law firms, boutique advisory firms and distressed/specialty lenders. In addition, our Board considered the other terms and conditions of the Investment Advisory Agreement, including the fact that we have the ability to terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon 60 days’ notice to Stellus Capital Management. As a result, our Board determined that the substantive terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement (other than the fees payable thereunder, which our Board reviewed separately), including the services to be provided, are similar to those of comparable externally managed BDCs described in the available market data and in the best interests of our stockholders. Moreover, our Board concluded that although the substantive terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, including the services to be provided, are generally the same as those of comparable externally managed BDCs described in the market data then available, it would be difficult to obtain similar services from other third-party service providers in light of the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to us by Stellus Capital Management.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Projected Costs of the Services Provided to the Company. Our Board considered (i) comparative data based on publicly available information with respect to services rendered and the advisory fees (including the base management fee and incentive fees) of other externally managed BDCs that invest in similar securities, our total expenses, and expense ratios compared to other externally managed BDCs of similar size and with similar investment objectives and (ii) the administrative services that Stellus Capital Management will provide to us at cost pursuant to the Administration Agreement. Based upon its review, our Board concluded that the fees to be paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement are generally comparable to or more favorable than those payable under agreements of comparable externally managed BDCs and reasonable in relation to the services expected to be provided by Stellus Capital Management.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Projected Profitability of Stellus Capital Management. Our Board considered information about Stellus Capital Management, including the anticipated costs of the services to be provided by Stellus Capital Management and the anticipated profits to be realized by it, including as a result of our investment performance, which would generally be equal or similar to the profitability of investment advisers managing comparable BDCs. Our Board reviewed our investment performance, as well as comparative data with respect to the investment performance of other externally-managed BDCs, as it relates to the management and incentive fees we pay Stellus Capital Management. As a result of this review, our Board determined that our investment performance supported the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Economies of Scale. Our Board considered the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Company grows, and whether the fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of our stockholders. Taking into account such information, our Board determined that the advisory fee structure under the Investment Advisory Agreement was reasonable with respect to any economies of scale that may be realized as the Company grows.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited Potential for Additional Benefits Derived by Stellus Capital Management. Our Board considered existing and potential sources of indirect income Stellus Capital Management would receive as a result of the relationship with us, and whether there would be potential for additional benefits to be derived by Stellus Capital Management as a result of our relationship, and was advised any such potential would be limited.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conclusions. In view of the wide variety of factors that our Board considered in connection with its evaluation of the Investment Advisory Agreement, it is not practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. The Board did not rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in connection with its evaluation of the Investment Advisory Agreement, nor did it undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate decision made by our Board. Rather, the Board based its approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement on the totality of information presented to it. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.

Based on the information reviewed and the discussions, the Board, including a majority of the independent directors, concluded that the investment management fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders.
Administration Agreement


Under the Administration Agreement, Stellus Capital Management furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and will provide us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Stellus Capital Management also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC. In addition, Stellus Capital Management assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, Stellus Capital Management also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance.
Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review of our Board) of Stellus Capital Management’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and his staff. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, Stellus Capital Management will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such portfolio companies for providing this assistance. The Administration Agreement has an initial term of two years and may be renewed with the approval of our Board. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. To the extent that Stellus Capital Management outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to Stellus Capital Management. Stockholder approval is not required to amend the Administration Agreement.
Indemnification



The Administration Agreement provides that Stellus Capital Management, its affiliates and their respective, officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Stellus Capital Management’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator. Our obligation to provide indemnification under the Administration Agreement, however, is limited by the 1940 Act and Investment Company Act Release No. 11330, which, among other things, prohibit us from indemnifying any director, officer or other individual from any liability resulting directly from the willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence in the performance of duties or reckless disregard of applicable obligations and duties of the directors, officers or other individuals and require us to set forth reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification shall be made.
License Agreement

We have entered into a license agreement with Stellus Capital Management under which Stellus Capital Management has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Stellus Capital.” Under this agreement, we have a right to use the “Stellus Capital” name for so long as Stellus Capital Management or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “Stellus Capital” name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with Stellus Capital Management is in effect.

Exchange Act Reports
We maintain a website at www.stelluscapital.com (under the public investors section). The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
Regulation as a Business Development Company

We are a BDC under the 1940 Act that has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies is fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval upon 60 days’ prior written notice to stockholders.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. Under the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, “eligible portfolio companies” include (1) private domestic operating companies, (2) public domestic operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange), and (3) public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than $250 million. Public domestic operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or through Pink Sheets LLC are not listed on a national securities exchange and therefore are eligible portfolio companies.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27




(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies


In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. However, when the BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. With respect to an SBIC, making available managerial assistance means the making of loans to a portfolio company. Stellus Capital Management will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Stellus Capital Management will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Warrants and Options
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the amount of warrants, options, restricted stock or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or conversion price is 

28



not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our Board approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in the best interests of us and our stockholders and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them have been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock.
Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Common Stock

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our and our stockholders’ best interests, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We would need approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval. We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act.
Codes of Ethics
We and Stellus Capital Management have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each such code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with such code’s requirements. In addition, each code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of each code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to Stellus Capital Management. The proxy voting policies and procedures of Stellus Capital Management are set out below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by Stellus Capital Management and our independent directors and, accordingly, are subject to change.
Introduction. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, Stellus Capital Management has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, Stellus Capital Management recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests.
Stellus Capital Management’s policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.

29



Proxy Policies. Stellus Capital Management votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Stellus Capital Management reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases Stellus Capital Management will vote in favor of proposals that Stellus Capital Management believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities we hold. Although Stellus Capital Management will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, Stellus Capital Management may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Stellus Capital Management has established a proxy voting committee and adopted proxy voting guidelines and related procedures. The proxy voting committee establishes proxy voting guidelines and procedures, oversees the internal proxy voting process, and reviews proxy voting issues. To ensure that Stellus Capital Management’s vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, Stellus Capital Management requires that anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote. Where conflicts of interest may be present, Stellus Capital Management will disclose such conflicts to us, including our independent directors and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“the Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

● | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company



As a BDC, we have elected, qualified, and intend to continue to qualify annually to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to maintain our RIC treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”).
For any taxable year in which we:

● | qualify as a RIC; and
--+----------------------


● | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement;
--+---------------------------------------------

We will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on our undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (a) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (b) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending December 31, and (c) any income and capital gain net income that we recognized in preceding years, but were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to U.S. federal income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

● | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each year;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31




our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (which generally are partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income), or the 90% Income Test; and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (ii) the securities, other than securities of other RICs, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or (iii) the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships, or the Diversification Tests.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. If we are not able to obtain sufficient cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on all of our taxable income without the benefit of the dividends-paid deduction.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy (i) the Annual Distribution Requirement and to otherwise eliminate our liability for U.S. federal income and excise taxes and/or (ii) the Diversification Tests. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted in certain circumstances to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See Item 1A. “Regulation as a Business Development Company — Senior Securities” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Tests may be limited by (a) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (b) other requirements relating to our qualifications as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Tests, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
In addition, we have formed and operate two SBIC subsidiaries, and are partially dependent on the SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirement. The SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA’s restrictions for the SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC tax treatment. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If the SBIC subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax.

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (a) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (b) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (c) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (d) convert lower-taxed long term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (e) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (f) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (g) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (h) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (i) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our disqualification as a RIC.

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may hold assets that generate such income and provide services that generate such fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.
If we are unable to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, and if certain remedial provisions are not available, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to such distributions, non-corporate stockholders would be able to treat such dividend income as “qualified dividend income,” which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to requalify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets ( i.e. , the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years.
Our Status as an Emerging Growth Company
We ceased to qualify as an “emerging growth company” beginning January 1, 2017.
The New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations
The New York Stock Exchange has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards applicable to BDCs.
Regulation as a Small Business Investment Company
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries’ SBIC licenses allow them to incur leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities.
SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses (together with their affiliates) include businesses that have a 

33



tangible net worth not exceeding $24.0 million and have average annual net income after U.S federal income taxes not exceeding $8.0 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote 25% of its investment activity to “smaller enterprises” as defined by the SBA. A smaller enterprise is a business (together with their affiliates) that has a net worth not exceeding $6 million and has average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $2 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility of a small business or a smaller enterprise, which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross sales of the business and its affiliates. According to SBA regulations, SBICs may make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services.
The SBA generally prohibits an SBIC from providing financing to small businesses with certain characteristics, such as relending or businesses with the majority of their employees located outside the United States, and business engaged in certain prohibited industries, such as project finance, real estate, farmland, financial intermediaries or “passive” (i.e. non-operating) businesses. Without prior SBA approval, an SBIC may not provide financing or a commitment to a small business in an amount equal to more than approximately 30.0% of the SBIC’s regulatory capital in any one company and its affiliates.
SBA regulations currently limit the amount that an SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $175.0 million with at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital (as defined in the SBA regulations), subject to SBA approval. The maximum leverage available to a “family” of SBIC funds is $350.0 million, subject to SBA approval. As of December 31, 2022, our SBIC I subsidiary had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which approximated their fair value. As of December 31, 2022, our SBIC II subsidiary had $87.5 million in regulatory capital and $163.6 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, which approximated their fair value.
We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the 150% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This allows us increased flexibility under the 150% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $325.0 million more (subject to SBA approval) than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.
The SBA restricts the ability of SBICs to repurchase their capital stock. The SBA restricts the ability of an SBIC to provide financing to an “associate” as defined in the SBA regulations, without prior written approval from the SBA. SBA regulations also prohibit, without prior SBA approval, include restrictions on a “change of control” or “change in ownership” of transfer of an SBIC (as such terms are defined in the SBA regulations) and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, our SBIC subsidiaries may also be limited in their ability to make distributions to us if they do not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations.
Our SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including, among other things, requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants, a periodic examination by an SBA examiner, and the performance of a financial audit by an independent auditor. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will receive SBA guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiaries’ assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate one or both of our SBIC subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by our SBIC subsidiaries upon an event of default.
