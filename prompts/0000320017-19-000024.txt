ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. (“we,” “us,” "our," “Caladrius” or the “Company”) is a late-stage therapeutics development biopharmaceutical company committed to the development of innovative products that have the potential to restore the health of people with chronic illnesses. Our leadership team collectively has decades of biopharmaceutical development experience and world-recognized scientific achievement in the fields of cardiovascular medicine and cell therapy, among other areas. Our goal is to build a broad portfolio of novel and versatile products that address important unmet medical needs. Our current product candidates include three developmental treatments for cardiovascular diseases based on our CD34+ cell therapy platform: CLBS12, in Phase 2 and eligible for early conditional approval in Japan for the treatment of critical limb ischemia ("CLI"); CLBS14-CMD, in Phase 2 in the U.S. for the treatment of coronary microvascular dysfunction ("CMD"); CLBS14-NORDA (previously known as CLBS14-RfA), for which we are in discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") to finalize the Phase 3 trial protocol for no-option refractory disabling angina ("NORDA"); and one autoimmune product candidate, CLBS03, an ex vivo expanded polyclonal T regulatory cell therapy for the treatment of recent-onset Type 1 diabetes ("T1D") for which we completed the analysis of the one-year follow-up data for the primary endpoint of a Phase 2a study and publicly reported on February 13, 2019 that the study did not meet its primary endpoint. 
Ischemic Repair (CD34 Cell Technology) 
Our CD34+ cell technology has led to the development of therapeutic product candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted. Through the administration of CD34+ cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new microvasculature and thereby increase blood flow to the impacted area. We believe that a number of conditions caused by underlying ischemic injury can be improved through our CD34+ cell technology, including, but not limited to, CLI, CMD and NORDA. 
Regarding CLBS12, our product candidate for CLI, after detailed discussion and agreement with the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency ("PMDA"), we opened a Phase 2 trial for enrollment in December 2017 and announced in March 2018 treatment of the first patient. Based on our discussions with the PMDA, we expect that a successful outcome of this trial, if achieved, will make CLBS12 eligible for early conditional approval in Japan, thereby effectively making our Phase 2 trial a potential registration trial in that strategic market. The initial responses observed in the small number of subjects who have reached an endpoint in this open label study are consistent with a positive therapeutic effect and safety profile as reported by previously published clinical trials in Japan and the U.S. While these early signs are encouraging, it is clear that the final outcome of the trial will be dependent on all data from all subjects.
In October 2017 we announced the award of a $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to support a clinical study of CD34+ cells in patients with CMD. This led to the initiation of development of CLBS14-CMD and enrollment of patients in our ESCaPE-CMD Phase 2 proof-of-concept study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA. The early results observed in this open label trial from the small number of subjects who have reached the 6-month (primary endpoint) follow-up visit support our expectations for CLBS14-CMD and its positive therapeutic effect and acceptable safety profile in this indication. While the final outcome of the trial will be dependent on the 6-month data from all subjects, these early observations of increased coronary flow reserve and decreased angina symptoms in treated patients are encouraging.
To support a development program of CD34+ cells in the indication of NORDA, we acquired the rights to data and regulatory filings for a CD34+ cell therapy program for refractory angina that had been advanced to Phase 3 under the previous investigational new drug application (“IND”) holder. We have designated this program CLBS14-NORDA and reactivated the IND with the FDA with Caladrius as the sponsor. We are presently working with the FDA to finalize the design of a single registration trial for the registration of CLBS14-NORDA and are targeting the initiation of that trial in fall of 2019. 
Immunomodulation (Treg Technology)
We have been developing for the last several years an innovative therapy for T1D (identified as CLBS03) that is based on a proprietary T regulatory cell platform technology for immunomodulation. CLBS03 was granted Fast Track and Orphan drug designations from the FDA for this proposed indication and was granted Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Product ("ATMP") classification from the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"). This program is based on the use of Tregs (T-regulatory cells) to treat diseases caused by imbalances in an individual's immune system. This novel approach seeks to restore

Index

immune balance by enhancing Treg number and function. Tregs are a natural part of the human immune system and regulate the activity of effector T cells, the cells that are responsible for protecting the body from pathogens and foreign antigens. When Tregs function properly, only harmful foreign materials are attacked by effector T cells. In autoimmune disease, however, it is thought that deficient Treg activity and numbers permit the effector T cells to attack the body's own beneficial cells. In the case of T1D, the beta cells in the pancreas are attacked, thereby reducing and/or eliminating over time the patient's ability to produce insulin. 
In 2016, we commenced patient enrollment in the first of two cohorts in The Sanford Project: T-Rex Study, a Phase 2a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CLBS03 in adolescents with recent onset T1D (the "T-Rex Study"). On February 13, 2019, we announced top line results indicating that the therapy was well-tolerated but that the study's primary endpoint of preservation of C-peptide had not been achieved. We further indicated that we and our advisors would conduct, over time, a comprehensive analysis of all data from the trial (including any 2-year follow-up data to come) and would take decisions regarding further development of CLBS03 based on the results of those analyses. 
Additional Out-licensing Opportunities
Our broad intellectual property portfolio of cell therapy assets includes notable programs available for out-licensing in order to continue their clinical development. These include additional indications for both our Treg product and our CD34+ cell technology. 
Our current long-term strategy focuses on advancing our therapies through development with the aim of eventually obtaining market authorizations and entering commercialization, either alone or with partners, to provide treatment options to patients suffering from life-threatening medical conditions. We believe that we are positioned to realize potentially meaningful value increases within our own proprietary pipeline if we are successful in advancing our product candidates to their next significant development milestones.

OVERVIEW OF THE CELL THERAPY FIELD
Regenerative medicine is defined as the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore normal function. Among the categories of therapeutic technology platforms within this field are cell therapy, tissue engineering, tools, device diagnostics and aesthetic medicine. In January 2019, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine recognized over 906 regenerative medicine companies worldwide, including gene and cell therapy developers and over 1,028 clinical trials.
All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates and then individual groups of cells differentiate (mature into complex cell types), thereby yielding the diversity of organs and organ systems in an adult organism. Cell therapy is a process that uses cells to prevent, treat or cure disease, or to regenerate damaged or aged tissue. To date, the most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, marrow and blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by the chemotherapy and radiation historically used to treat many cancers. Today, these types of cell therapies are standard practice world-wide and their associated costs are often reimbursed by insurance.

There are two general classes of cell therapies: autologous and allogeneic. When cells are collected from a person (donor) and transplanted or used to develop a treatment solely for that same person (recipient or patient) with or without modification, the treatment paradigm is known as “autologous” cell therapy. Autologous cells offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient. When the donor and the recipient are not the same individual, the procedures are referred to as “allogeneic” cell therapy. 
Various cell therapies are in clinical development for an array of human diseases, including autoimmune, oncologic, cardiovascular, neurologic and orthopedic diseases, among other indications. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy holds the promise to better the human experience and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common and often life-threatening diseases. The FDA has been investing significant resources into policies and organizational changes to advance the cell and gene therapy fields in recent years through what the agency has labeled its “comprehensive regenerative medicine policy framework,” as first announced in late 2017 and incrementally developed since that time through various agency actions. Most recently, the FDA stated in January 2019 that it would be adding another 50 clinical reviewers to the group charged with overseeing the clinical investigation, development and review of cell therapy and gene therapy products.
CELL THERAPY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Ischemic Repair (CD34+ Cell Technology)
Our CD34+ cell technology has led to the development of therapeutic product candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted. Through the administration of CD34+ cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new microvasculature and thereby increase blood flow to the impacted area. We believe that a number of conditions caused by underlying ischemic injury can be improved through our CD34+ cell technology, including but not limited to CLI, CMD and NORDA. 
Regarding CLBS12, our product candidate for CLI, after detailed discussion and agreement with the Japanese PMDA, we opened a Phase 2 trial for enrollment in December 2017 and announced in March 2018 treatment of the first patient. Based on our discussions with the PMDA, we expect that a successful outcome of this trial, if achieved, will make CLBS12 eligible for early conditional approval in Japan, thereby effectively making our Phase 2 trial a potential registration trial in that strategic market. Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare ("MHLW") awarded CLBS12 "SAKIGAKE" designation (a Japanese regulatory status that is similar in certain respects to "breakthrough therapy" designation granted by the FDA to eligible investigational treatments) reflecting its expectation of "prominent effectiveness" based on data from non-clinical and early phase clinical trials. The SAKIGAKE designation system promotes research and development in Japan, driving early practical application for innovative pharmaceutical products, medical devices and regenerative medicines. As a SAKIGAKE-designated therapy, CLBS12 is expected to have the benefits of prioritized consultation, a dedicated review system to support the development and review process, as well as reduced review time from the normal 12 months down to 6 months. In anticipation of a potential successful trial outcome and the possibility of conditional approval, we continue to seek a local partner for CLBS12 in Japan. Conditional marketing approval of CLBS12 in Japan may also include some form of post-marketing requirement to be defined at the time of approval. The initial responses observed in the small number of subjects who have reached an endpoint in this open label study are consistent with a positive therapeutic effect and safety profile as reported by previously published clinical trials in Japan and the U.S. While these early signs are encouraging, it is clear that the final outcome of the trial will be dependent on all data from all subjects.
In October 2017 we announced the award of a $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to support a clinical study of CD34+ cells in patients with CMD. This led to the initiation of development of CLBS14-CMD and enrollment of patients in our ESCaPE-CMD Phase 2 proof-of-concept study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA. The early results observed in this open label trial from the small number of subjects who have reached the 6-month (primary endpoint) follow-up visit support our expectations for CLBS14-CMD and its positive therapeutic effect and acceptable safety profile in this indication. While the final outcome of the trial will be dependent on the 6-month data from all subjects, these early observations of increased coronary flow reserve and decreased angina symptoms in treated patients are encouraging.
To support a development program of CD34+ cells in the indication of NORDA, we acquired the rights to data and regulatory filings for a CD34+ cell therapy program for refractory angina that had been advanced to Phase 3 under the previous IND holder. We have designated this program CLBS14-NORDA and reactivated the IND with the FDA with Caladrius as the sponsor. On June 19, 2018, we announced receipt of Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation from the FDA for CLBS14-NORDA for the treatment of no option refractory disabling angina. This designation affords us the opportunity to work with the FDA to advance more rapidly and efficiently the development of this therapeutic candidate

in an indication that currently has high morbidity and no effective treatment options. We are presently working with the FDA to finalize the design of a single registration trial for the registration of CLBS14-NORDA and are targeting the initiation of that trial in the fall of 2019. 
Immuno Modulation (T Regulatory Cell Program)
Many immune-mediated diseases are the result of an imbalance between immune effector and regulatory mechanisms whereby pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines eventually go unchecked and mistakenly attack beneficial cells in the body. Our T regulatory cell therapy platform, derived in part from intellectual property created from research performed at the University of California, San Francisco ("UCSF"), represents a novel experimental approach to restoring immune balance by enhancing Treg number and function to control pathologic immune responses. Tregs are a natural part of the human immune system and regulate the activity of effector T cells, the cells that are responsible for protecting the body from pathogens and foreign antigens. When Tregs function properly only harmful foreign materials are attacked by effector T cells. In autoimmune disease, however, it is thought that deficient Treg activity and numbers play a role in the immune system’s attack on the body's own cells. In the case of T1D, the beta cells in the pancreas are attacked, thereby reducing and/or eliminating over time the patient's ability to produce insulin. Insulin is necessary to regulate sugar metabolism and maintain proper sugar levels in the blood. Inconsistent or unnatural insulin levels can lead to many complications, including blindness, vascular disease and, if no insulin supplement is provided, even death. There are currently no curative treatments for T1D, only lifelong insulin therapy, which often does not prevent serious co-morbidities in patients.
We established a collaboration with UCSF through patent and data licenses and through collaboration with the laboratories of Drs. Jeffrey Bluestone and Qizhi Tang, experts in the field of Tregs and immune tolerance, to develop CLBS03, an autologous ex vivo expanded polyclonal Treg product, for the treatment of T1D. Building on prior independent published human clinical human clinical data and findings cited in Science Translational Medicine and Cell Metabolism, we initiated in the first quarter of 2016 the T-Rex Study, a Phase 2a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CLBS03 in adolescents with recent onset T1D. Clinical data collection of the one-year follow-up data was completed in January 2019, and on February 13, 2019 we announced that the therapy was well-tolerated but that the study's primary endpoint of preservation of C-peptide had not been achieved. We further indicated that we and our advisors would conduct, over time, a comprehensive analysis of all data from the trial (including any two-year follow-up data to come) and would make decisions regarding further development of CLBS03 based on the results of those analyses.
TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES
Ischemic Repair (CD34+ Cell Technology)
As is the case with our T Regulatory Cell Technology, our CD34+ Cell Technology is a platform technology with potential application to a broad array of ischemic conditions and we will seek to out-license our technology in geographies or indications that we do not intend ourselves to pursue. 
Ischemic Repair (CD34+ Cell) Intellectual Property Platform
Our developed and owned ischemic repair patent portfolio comprises the following:

• | Nine U.S. patents, two EU patents (each filed in 5 individual countries) and 7 other patents in geographies outside the U.S. (Japan, Canada, Russia, Hong Kong);


• | Claims cover, inter alia, a pharmaceutical composition that contains a therapeutic concentration of non-expanded CD34+ stem cells that move in response to SDF-1 or VEGF, together with a stabilizing amount of serum, that can be delivered to repair an injury caused by vascular insufficiency;


• | Issued and pending claims can be applied to a broad range of conditions caused by underlying ischemia, including: acute myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial ischemia post-AMI; chronic heart failure; critical limb ischemia; and ischemic brain injury;


• | Three pending patent applications outside the United States.

Market Opportunity and Competition for CLI
In Japan, there are roughly 300,000 patients with CLI, of whom roughly 51,000 are not candidates for revascularization, making them the addressable population for CLBS12. The addressable population is roughly 560,000 patients in the EU and 300,000 in the U.S., respectively. 
The field of cardiovascular cell therapy development is competitive. There are a number of companies that are developing stem cell-based therapies for cardiovascular diseases, including, but not limited to, Celyad, Capricor, Inc., Mesoblast Limited,

Index

Athersys, Inc., Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. and Vericel Corporation. These companies are utilizing a number of different therapeutic approaches in their development efforts. There are both autologous and allogeneic based competitive therapies that derive cells principally from four sources: fat, peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. CLBS12 is an autologous therapy that derives its cells from peripheral blood via apheresis. Stempeutics Research Pvt. Ltd., including the joint venture between Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. and Sosei CVC, are examples of companies working in Japan with allogeneic cell therapy product candidates for CLI. 
Market Opportunity and Competition for CMD
In the United States, there are roughly 8,300,000 patients with CMD, while the addressable population is roughly 6,000,000 in the EU and 1,000,000 in Japan, respectively.
We have not identified any additional companies developing stem cell-based therapies for CMD. 
Market Opportunity and Competition for NORDA
In the United States, we have identified fewer than 100,000 patients with refractory angina as candidates for CLBS14-NORDA.
From a competitive standpoint, though not within cell therapy but more broadly in the regenerative medicine field, Angionetics is currently developing an angiogenic gene therapy product candidate designed for medical revascularization for the potential treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia and refractory angina due to advanced coronary artery disease.
Immune Modulation (T Regulatory Cell Technology)
Our Treg technology platform is potentially applicable to multiple autoimmune and allergic diseases beyond our target indication of T1D. For example, certain evidence suggests that a failure of Tregs may be important in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus ("SLE") and that Treg therapy may therefore be helpful in treatment of SLE. Additionally, Tregs have been evaluated in early phase human clinical trials and have indicated clinical benefit for graft-versus-host disease ("GVHD"). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammatory bowel disease are other indications for which we believe Tregs may have a meaningful therapeutic effect. Trials sponsored by third parties are currently underway for active cutaneous lupus and immune tolerance following kidney transplantation.
Immune Modulation Intellectual Property Platform 
We have assembled a patent portfolio through licenses to IP from leaders in the field of Tregs (UCSF/Jeffrey Bluestone et al, Centenary Institute) comprising:

• | Sixteen patents and three pending patent applications;


• | Claims covering many facets of Tregs, including:


• | Methods of Treg isolation, expansion and activation/stimulation as sourced from peripheral blood and cord blood; and


• | Methods of treating or preventing Type 1 diabetes using Tregs.


• | Patents and applications covering international geographies (United States, EU, Japan, China, Australia and Canada); and


• | An option on patent licenses to critical reagents employed in Treg therapeutic development.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
The health care industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States and abroad. Various governmental regulatory authorities, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. The following is a general description of certain current laws and regulations that are relevant to our business. 
Premarket Review and Approval of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products in the United States
In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post- market regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, 
8

Index

recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products, intended for therapeutic uses. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act"). However, biological products that also meet the definition of “drugs” under the FD&C Act are also subject to regulation under FD&C Act provisions and to applicable provisions from two sets of FDA implementing regulations, those for biological products and those for drugs. Another distinction between pharmaceuticals and cellular therapies is that the PHS Act requires the submission of a biologics license application ("BLA"), rather than a New Drug Application ("NDA"), for market authorization of a cellular therapy candidate like ours. Generally, the application process and requirements for product approval under BLA is similar to those for an NDA, and the review process for biological products is associated with similar approval risks and application costs as for chemical entity drug products.
Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. Under certain circumstances, individual members of company management may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties related to company violations of applicable legal requirements.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new pharmaceutical or biological product in the United States typically must undertake the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good laboratory practice or GLP regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which includes the detailed clinical protocol and which must take effect before human clinical trials can commence;
•approval of the clinical trial protocol and the sponsor's safeguards for human subjects by one or more institutional review boards, or "IRBs," depending on the numbers of clinical sites and other features of the study design, before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or "GCPs," to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each proposed indication for which FDA approval is sought;
•satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA, as appropriate;
•review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable, as determined by the FDA at its discretion;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the regulations establishing current Good Manufacturing Practices, or “cGMPs,” and current Good Tissue Practices or “cGTPs” (if applicable), and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used for the manufacture, processing and packing of the drug or biological product are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
•payment of applicable user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA. 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Moreover, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to initiate a clinical trial if the FDA raises concerns or questions about the design of the clinical trial or the preclinical or manufacturing information supporting it, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. After a trial is initiated, 
9

Index

the FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and GCPs, which are meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors clinical protocol is updated or revised after the original IND submission and initiation of protocol amendment must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, sponsors of most clinical trials involving FDA regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry and results database managed by the NIH and called ClinicalTrials.gov. Registration information that must be submitted includes information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Failure to comply with applicable clinical trial registration or results reporting obligations can result in civil monetary penalties or the withholding of grant funds from a federally funded grantee.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or may be combined. Under certain circumstances, a fourth post-approval phase may be required.

• | Phase 1: Trials in this phase are initially conducted in a limited population of healthy volunteers to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients, when the drug or biologic is too toxic to be ethically given to healthy individuals.


• | Phase 2: These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to determine the presence and approximate magnitude of therapeutic effect of the product for specific targeted indications and to identify appropriate therapeutic dose and dose frequency as well as any corresponding additional possible adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal or registration studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are typically undertaken in a larger patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple and geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug as a requirement marketing approval licensure.


• | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA or BLA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily carry out additional trials post approval to gain more information about the drug or biologic.


Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA seeking approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, most NDA or BLA submissions are additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. The current fee for FY2019 is $2,588,478 and an annual program fee, currently $309,915, must also be paid for approved drugs or biologics. These fees are typically adjusted annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency's threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. If the application is not sufficiently complete, the FDA may issue a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter, although the FDA may permit an applicant to correct certain easily correctable deficiencies in the NDA/BLA before filing without taking an official RTF action. Under certain NDA and BLA review performance goals to which the FDA has agreed, most applications for standard review of drug or biological 
10

Index

products are reviewed within ten to twelve months, and most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed within six to eight months. If a sponsor submits a major amendment to a filed NDA or BLA at any time during the review cycle, the FDA may extend these reviews by three months although only one such extension is permitted during a review cycle. Priority review can be applied to drugs or biologics that, in the FDA's determination, offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment for a disease or condition for which no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited to products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to currently approved products. Priority review requests must be submitted in conjunction with the original NDA/BLA for which the sponsor is seeking the designation, and the FDA decision will be made in conjunction with its official action to file the application and begin the substantive review process.
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients beyond existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA or BLA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with applicable cGMP and cGTP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the drug or biological product within required specifications and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective for the proposed indication.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products, or drug or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but the FDA will carefully consider them.
After the FDA fully evaluates the NDA or BLA and the relevant manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval/licensure letter or a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmitted NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions within two or six months, depending on the type of information being provided to address the deficiencies in the CRL. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a drug or biological product for marketing in the U.S., it may limit the approved indications for use for the product; require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling; require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval; require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization; or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or “REMS,” which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA also may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or patient populations, making certain types of manufacturing changes or seeking to make additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
One potential condition of approval is that the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.  To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS requirements are tailored to the specific risk/benefit profile of a drug and can include requirements such as medication guides for patients, detailed communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or “ETASU.” ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, restricted distribution, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS as a condition of approval or may add such a requirement at any point post-approval if it becomes aware

of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS and the specific components that are involved can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
Expedited Review Programs (Fast Track, Breakthrough, RMAT) and Accelerated Approval Pathways
The FDA is authorized to facilitate the development and expedite the review of certain drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track Program, the sponsor of an IND for a drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, The FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This "rolling review' is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. The FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application, however, does not begin until the last section of the NDA/BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Separately, under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients beyond existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug such that accelerated approval also referred to as U.S. "conditional" approval. Products granted accelerated approval also are subject to additional requirements for the pre-dissemination review by the FDA of proposed promotional materials both during the NDA review process and for 120 days after marketing approval.
Another available program for expediting development and review of drugs or biological products, the FDA may designate an investigational product as a Breakthrough Therapy or as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy ("RMAT"), depending on the type of product and its ability to meet applicable eligibility criteria. Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). The RMAT designation requires similar eligibility criteria to be met, but it is available only to cell therapies, tissue therapies, and other products that meet the statutory definition of a “regenerative medicine therapy.” Specifically, a biological product is eligible for RMAT designation if: (a) the product candidate is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined in the FD&C Act as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under the PHS Act (that is, excluding those biological products that are not also regulated as “drugs” under the FD&C Act); (b) the product candidate is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (c) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Both Breakthrough Therapy and RMAT designations are intended to help accelerate product development by allowing more frequent interactions with the FDA and receiving intensive FDA guidance on efficient drug development.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA"), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data, and those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trial or trials the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any

deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers or deferrals for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although the FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ("BPCA") provides approved NDA and BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity that attaches to the end of all existing marketing exclusivities and patents for the drug. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.) Orphan drug designation must be requested by an applicant before submitting an NDA or BLA for the relevant drug candidate. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the FDA will publicly disclose the generic identity of the drug candidate and its potential orphan use. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances comprising different ways that a second sponsor can demonstrate clinical superiority of its drug in comparison to the first approved orphan drug. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a designated orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was described in its orphan drug designation request, it may not be entitled to exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation, the sponsor receives a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee and is eligible for tax credits for certain research (although the amount of this potential tax credit was decreased from 50% to 25% of qualified clinical testing expenses with the 2017 overhaul of the U.S. Tax Code, effective in 2018).
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs and biological products manufactured, marketed or distributed pursuant to FDA approval decisions are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to FDA review and approval before they can be implemented. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and related manufacturing facilities, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture of approved drugs are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP/cGTP requirements. Prescription drug distribution facilities are also subject to state licensure, including inspections, by the relevant local regulatory authority. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug or biologic are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or cGTP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and others involved in the product’s manufacturing process. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP/cGTP compliance and ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements the FD&C Act, such as the requirements for making manufacturing changes to an approved NDA or BLA.
Thus, even after a new drug approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw that approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. If a previously unknown problem, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, is discovered or the manufacturer fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the FDA may require revisions to the approved labeling to

add new safety information; may impose additional post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or may impose distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug and biological products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant penalties. In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to a variety of federal and state laws, the most recent of which is still in the process of being phased in to the U.S. supply chain and regulatory framework.
Other Health Care Regulations
If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other federal and state laws and regulations that could directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate the business and/or financial performance include:

• | state and local licensure, applicable to the processing and storage of human cells and tissues;


• | laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, including the Office for Human Research Protections and the Office of Inspector General;


• | state laws and regulations governing human subject research;


• | federal and state coverage and reimbursement laws and regulations, including laws and regulations administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state Medicaid agencies;


• | the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Law and similar state laws and regulations;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and similar state laws and regulations;


• | the federal physician self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents of the Stark Law;


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to certain persons and entities;


• | Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements;


• | state and local laws and regulations dealing with the handling and disposal of medical waste; and


• | the Intermediate Sanctions rules of the IRS providing for potential financial sanctions with respect to “Excess Benefit Transactions” with tax-exempt organizations.

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Japan's Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Authority Regulation of Regenerative Medicine
Prior to 2014, there was no specific regulatory oversight of regenerative medicine products in Japan. However, in November 2013, the Japanese authorities revised the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and renamed it the Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Other Therapeutic Products Act (the "PMD Act"). The new legislation became effective on November 25, 2014 and provides for a timely introduction of innovative regenerative medicine products. The new legislation formalizes a legal basis for development of regenerative medicine therapies. The new legislation defines regenerative medicine products as processed human cells that are intended to be used for either (1) the reconstructive repair, or formation of structures or functions of the human body; (2) the treatment or prevention of human diseases; or (3) gene therapy.
The legislation allows the PMDA/Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare ("MHLW") to award conditional approval to a regenerative medicine therapy if there is evidence of adequate safety and results which predict likely efficacy. The evidence for efficacy may be based on surrogate endpoints and may come from an exploratory study. This conditional approval is time-limited, and there must be an agreement with PMDA/MHLW as to follow-up collection of information which confirms efficacy and safety, similar to a post-marketing commitment in the United States.
Under the PMD Act, products under consideration may also be given a SAKIGAKE designation (similar to an FDA "Breakthrough" or "RMAT" designation in certain respects) and/or may be granted a priority review status. Additionally, there is a commitment that the PMDA will facilitate research and development by giving scientific and regulatory advice to sponsors from the early stage of development.
According to the new legislation, the sponsor prepares a marketing authorization application which is submitted for review to the PMDA. The PMDA reviews the application and prepares a review report and recommendation which is submitted to the MHLW. The MHLW reviews the recommendation and makes a decision regarding approval of the product. This procedure is followed for both a conditional approval and subsequently for a full approval after the post-marketing commitments have been fulfilled.
