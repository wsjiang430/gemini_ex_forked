Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
Digital Brand Media & Marketing Group, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “DBMM”, “DBMM Group”, the “Company”) f/k/a RTG Ventures, Inc. (“RTG”) is an OTC:PK listed company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Florida on September 29, 1998.
 
On March 20, 2007, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Atlantic Network Holdings Limited, New Media Television (Europe) Limited (“NMTV”), and Certain Outside Stockholders to acquire all of the outstanding shares of NMTV. Atlantic Network Holdings Limited is a Guernsey company limited by shares and NMTV is a United Kingdom private company limited by shares. The transaction was subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, including the satisfactory completion of the audit of NMTV’s financial statements for each of its past three fiscal years. The conditions of closing were not met by ANHL and the agreement was rescinded via 8-K/A on March 30, 2010.
 
DBMM entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), on March 31, 2010, with Cloud Channel Limited which was subsequently re-named as RTG Ventures (Europe) Limited in July 2010 (“RTG Ventures (Europe)”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of RTG Ventures (Europe) from its stockholders for consideration consisting of Convertible Preferred Shares of RTG Ventures, Inc. according to the derivative valuation methodologies outlined in the Share Exchange Agreement of Stylar Limited, a/k/a Digital Clarity. RTG Ventures (Europe) has been valued 12 months forward “notionally” one year hence. An 8-K/A was filed in September 2010 containing audited financials of the acquisition of Stylar Limited which completed the transaction. Shareholders converted the preferred shares into common stock using the average share price of the 30 days preceding September 3, 2011 which provided a share price of $0.016083. The methodology provided a valuation of 4X net profit. All preferred stock was held by DBMM’s transfer agent for the 12-month period ending September 3, 2011. All voting shares were held by management.
 
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year 2011 following substantial investment, the Company conducted a structural review of its total product and services offering. The review was carried out by the Board of Directors. The result was to bring technology development being outsourced directly into the Company to steward on a daily basis and any activities which were not revenue generating in the near term were eliminated. Certain business lines were eliminated from the Business Plan immediately. In October 2011 the joint venture with iPayu was mutually withdrawn and in December 2011 the acquisition of Bitemark Ltd. was rescinded. The companies reverted to the same position each held prior to the contracts.
 
The rescission of the Bitemark Ltd. share purchase agreement was included as an exhibit to the filing for the 2011 fiscal year even though it constituted a subsequent event at the time.
 
As a further result of the review, the Company also agreed to strategically focus on developing the business of its wholly owned and revenue generating online marketing services company, Digital Clarity. With deep DNA in its operating market, blending the services of an experienced professional workforce, leveraging a technology offering positions the Company in a strong, forward looking structure. Digital Clarity operates in the growing area of digital marketing that helps companies make the most of the digital economy focusing on areas such as Search Page Engine Marketing (Google, Yahoo! & Bing), Social Media (Twitter, Facebook & LinkedIn) and Internet Strategy Planning including Design, Analytics and Mobile Marketing.
