     Item 1. Business.
     Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware holding company with operating subsidiaries that provide a wide range of communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier channels across a 23-state service area.  We were founded in 1894 as the Mattoon Telephone Company by the great-grandfather of one of the members of our Board of Directors, Richard A. Lumpkin.  After several acquisitions, the Mattoon Telephone Company was incorporated as the Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company in 1924.  We were incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 2002, and through our predecessors, we have been providing communication services in many of the communities we serve for more than a century.
     In addition to our focus on organic growth in our commercial and carrier channels, we have achieved business growth and a diversification of revenue and cash flow streams that have created a strong platform for future growth through our acquisitions over the last decade.  Our strategic approach to evaluating potential transactions includes analysis of the market opportunity, the quality of the network, our ability to integrate the acquired company efficiently and the potential for creating significant operating synergies and generating positive cash flow at the inception of each acquisition.  Operating synergies are created through the use of consistent platforms, convergence of processes and functional management of the combined entities.  We measure our synergies during the first two years following an acquisition.  For example, the acquisition of our Texas properties in 2004 tripled the size of our business and gave us the requisite scale to make system and platform decisions that would facilitate future acquisitions.  The acquisition of our Pennsylvania properties in 2007 achieved synergies in excess of $12.0 million in annualized savings, which at the time, represented approximately 20% of their operating expense.  The acquisition of SureWest Communications in 2012 achieved synergies of $29.5 million during the first two years subsequent to the acquisition date.  The acquisition of Enventis Corporation (“Enventis”) in October 2014 generated annual operating synergies of approximately $17.0 million during the first two years subsequent to the acquisition date.  As a result of the acquisition of FairPoint Communications, Inc. (“FairPoint”) in July 2017, as described below, we expect to generate annual operating synergies of approximately $75.0 million over the first two years subsequent to the acquisition date.  Through these acquisitions, we have positioned our business to provide services in rural, suburban and metropolitan markets, with service territories spanning the country.
     Recent Business Developments
     On July 3, 2017, we completed the acquisition of FairPoint pursuant to the terms of a definitive agreement and plan of merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”) and acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of FairPoint in exchange

for shares of our common stock.  As a result, FairPoint became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  FairPoint was an advanced communications provider to business, wholesale and residential customers within its service territory, which spanned across 17 states.  FairPoint owned and operated a robust fiber-based network with more than 22,000 route miles of fiber, including 17,000 route miles of fiber in northern New England.  The financial results for FairPoint have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date. The acquisition reflects our strategy to diversify revenue and cash flows among multiple products and to expand our network to new markets.  
     See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report in Part II – Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a more detailed discussion of this transaction.

     Consolidated is a broadband and business communications provider offering a wide range of communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier customers across a 23-state service area and an advanced fiber network spanning 37,000 fiber route miles across many rural areas and metro communities.  Our business product suite includes: data and Internet solutions, voice, data center services, security services, managed and IT services, and an expanded suite of cloud services.  We provide wholesale solutions to wireless and wireline carriers and other service providers including data, voice, network connections and custom fiber builds and last mile connections.  We offer residential high-speed Internet, video, phone and home security services as well as multi-service residential and small business bundles.  Consolidated is dedicated to turning technology into solutions, connecting people and enriching how our customers work and live. 
     We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from subscriptions to our broadband, data and transport services (collectively “broadband services”) marketed to business and residential customers.  Our acquisition of FairPoint in 2017, as described above, provides us significantly greater scale and an expanded fiber network which allows for additional growth opportunities and expansion.  
     Commercial and carrier services represent the largest source of our operating revenues and are expected to be key growth areas in the future.  We are focused on enhancing our broadband and commercial product suite and are continually enhancing our commercial product offerings to meet the needs of our business customers.  We leverage our advanced fiber networks and tailor our services for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs.  Additionally, we are continuously enhancing our suite of managed and cloud services, which increases efficiency and enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses.  We anticipate future momentum in commercial and carrier services as these products gain traction as well as from the demand from customers for additional bandwidth and data-based services. 
     We market our residential services by leading with broadband or bundled services, which includes high-speed Internet, video and phone services.  As consumer demands for bandwidth continue to increase, our focus is on enhancing our broadband services, and progressively increasing broadband speeds.  We offer data speeds of up to 1 Gigabits per second (“Gbps”) in select markets, and up to 100 Mbps in markets where 1 Gbps is not yet available, depending on the geographical region. As we continue to increase broadband speeds, we are also able to simultaneously expand the array of services and content offerings that the network provides. 
     A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in Part I – Item 1A – “Risk Factors”, which is incorporated herein by reference.

      The comparability of our consolidated results of operations and key operating statistics was impacted by the FairPoint acquisition that closed on July 3, 2017, as described above.  FairPoint’s results are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the acquisition.
     All telecommunications providers continue to face increased competition as a result of technology changes and legislative and regulatory developments in the industry.  We continue to focus on commercial growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for both small and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances.  In addition, we expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as consumer and commercial demands for data based services increase, which will offset, in part, the anticipated decline in traditional voice services impacted by the ongoing industry-wide reduction in residential access lines.
     Commercial and Carrier 
      Data and Transport Services         We provide a variety of business communication services to small, medium and large business customers, including many services over our advanced fiber network.  The services we offer include scalable high-speed broadband Internet access and Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) phone services, which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. Our hosted VoIP package utilizes soft switching technology and enables our customers to have the flexibility of employing new telephone advances and features without investing in a new telephone system.  The package bundles local service, calling features, Internet protocol (“IP”) business telephones and unified messaging, which integrates multiple messaging technologies into a single system and allows the customer to receive and listen to voice messages through email.

 In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including a portfolio of Ethernet services; software defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”), a software-based network technology that provides a simplified management and automation of wide area network (“WAN”) connections; multi-protocol label switching (“MPLS”); and private line services to provide high bandwidth connectivity across point-to-point and multiple site networks.  Networking services are available at a variety of speeds up to 10 Gbps.  Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers.  We offer a suite of cloud-based services, which includes a hosted unified communications solution that replaces the customer’s on-site phone systems and data networks, managed network security services and data protection services. 
     We also offer wholesale services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers, including cellular backhaul, dark fiber and other fiber transport solutions with speeds up to 100 Gbps.  The demand for backhaul services continues to grow as wireless carriers are faced with escalating consumer and commercial demands for wireless data. 
      Voice Services 
      Voice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers.  The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding, speed dialing and call waiting.  Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate, a measured rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate.  Through the acquisition of FairPoint, we are now a full service 9-1-1 provider and have installed and now maintain two turn-key, state of the art statewide next-generation emergency 9-1-1 systems.  These systems, located in Maine and Vermont, have processed over three million calls relying on the caller's location information for routing. Next-generation emergency 9-1-1 systems are an improvement over traditional 9-1-1 and are expected to provide the foundation to handle future communication modes such as texting and video.     Other 
      Other services revenues include business equipment sales and related hardware and maintenance support, rental income of customer premises equipment, video services and other miscellaneous revenues.
     Consumer 
      Broadband Services 
      Broadband services include revenues from residential customers for subscriptions to our data and VoIP products.  We offer high-speed Internet access at speeds of up to 1 Gbps, depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location.  Our data service plans also include wireless internet access, email and internet security and protection.  Our VoIP digital phone service is also available in certain markets as an alternative to the traditional telephone line.  We offer multiple voice service plans with customizable calling features and voicemail including voicemail to email options.       Video Services 
      Depending on geographic market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which includes several plans, each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and Pay-Per-View channels as well as video On-Demand service.  Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders (“DVR”) and/or a whole home DVR.  Our Whole Home DVR allows customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any television in the house, record multiple shows at one time and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface.  Video subscribers also have access to our TV Everywhere service in certain markets, which allows subscriber access to full episodes of available shows, movies and live streams using a computer or mobile device.  In addition, we offer other in-demand streaming content, including: DIRECTV®, DIRECTV NOWSM, fuboTV, Philo, HBO NOW®, FlixFling and VEMOX.     Voice Services 
      We offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans.  The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting.  The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenue we generate from end 

 
  4

 
users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines.  We expect to continue to experience erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies, including our own competing VoIP product. 
     Equipment Sales and Service 
      Until the sale of our Enterprise Services equipment and IT Services business (“EIS”) in December 2016, discussed below, we were an accredited Master Level Unified Communications and Gold Certified Cisco Partner providing equipment solutions and support for business customers.  As an equipment integrator, we offered network design, implementation and support services, including maintenance contracts, in order to provide integrated communication solutions for our customers.  We sold telecommunications equipment, such as key, Private Branch Exchange (“PBX”), IP-based telephone systems and other sophisticated hardware solutions, and offered support services to medium and large business customers.  Our strategic relationship with Cisco as the supplier allowed us to deploy a wide range of collaboration, data center and network technology solutions.  We earned Cisco’s Master Cloud Builder Specialization and received the Data Center Interconnect designation.  We maintained numerous Cisco specializations and authorizations, as well as partner relationships with EMC, NetApp, VMware and other industry-leading vendors in order to provide integrated communication solutions that best fit our customers’ needs.
     In December 2016, we completed the sale of EIS to ePlus Technology inc. (“ePlus”).  As part of the transaction, we entered into a Co-Marketing Agreement with ePlus, a nationwide systems integrator of technology solutions, to cross-sell both broadband network services and IT services from December 2016 through November 2018.  The strategic partnership provided our business customers access to a broader suite of IT solutions, and also provided ePlus customers access to Consolidated’s business network services.
     Subsidies 
      Subsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality broadband services at affordable prices with higher data speeds in rural areas.  Subsidies are funded by end user surcharges to which telecommunications providers, including local, long-distance and wireless carriers, contribute on a monthly basis.  Subsidies are allocated and distributed to participating carriers monthly based upon their respective costs for providing local service.  Similar to access charges, subsidies are regulated by the federal and state regulatory commissions.  See Part I – Item 1 – “Regulatory Environment” below and Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business” for further discussion regarding the subsidies we receive.     Network Access Services 
      Network access services include interstate and intrastate switched access revenues, network special access services and end user access.  Switched access revenues include access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network.  Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers.  Certain of our network access revenues are based on rates set or approved by the federal and state regulatory commissions or as directed by law that are subject to change at any time.     Other Products and Services
     Other products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising, billing and support services and other miscellaneous revenue.
     No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
     Wireless Partnerships
     In addition to our core business, we also derive a portion of our cash flow and earnings from investments in five wireless partnerships.  Wireless partnership investment income is included as a component of other income in the consolidated statements of operations.  Our wireless partnership investment consists of five cellular partnerships: GTE Mobilnet of South Texas Limited Partnership (“Mobilnet South Partnership”), GTE Mobilnet of Texas RSA #17 Limited Partnership (“RSA #17”), Pittsburgh SMSA Limited Partnership (“Pittsburgh SMSA”), Pennsylvania RSA No. 6(I) Limited Partnership (“RSA 6(I)”) and Pennsylvania RSA No. 6(II) Limited Partnership (“RSA 6(II)”).  

 
  5

 

     Cellco Partnership (“Cellco”) is the general partner for each of the five cellular partnerships.  Cellco is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc.  As the general partner, Cellco is responsible for managing the operations of each partnership.
     We own 2.34% of the Mobilnet South Partnership.  The principal activity of the Mobilnet South Partnership is providing cellular service in the Houston, Galveston and Beaumont, Texas metropolitan areas.  We account for this investment at our initial cost less any impairment because fair value is not readily available for this investment.  Income is recognized only upon cash distributions of our proportionate earnings in the partnership.
     We own 20.51% of RSA #17, which serves areas in and around Conroe, Texas.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method.  Income is recognized on our proportionate share of earnings and cash distributions are recorded as a reduction in our investment.
     We own 3.60% of Pittsburgh SMSA, 16.67% of RSA 6(I) and 23.67% of RSA 6(II).  These partnerships cover territories that almost entirely overlap the markets served by our Pennsylvania Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (“ILEC”) and Competitive Local Exchange Carrier operations.  Because of our limited influence over Pittsburgh SMSA, we account for this investment at our initial cost less any impairment because fair value is not readily available for this investment.  RSA 6(I) and RSA 6(II) are accounted for under the equity method.
     For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized income of $39.3 million, $31.4 million and $32.6 million, respectively, and received cash distributions of $39.1 million, $30.0 million and $32.1 million, respectively, from these wireless partnerships.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,600 employees, including part-time employees.  We also use temporary employees in the normal course of our business.
     Approximately 47% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2018.  For a more detailed discussion regarding how the collective bargaining agreements could affect our business, see Part I - Item 1A – Risk Factors – “Risks Relating to Our Business”.     Sales and Marketing
     The key components of our overall marketing strategy include:
    
· | Organizing our sales and marketing activities around our three customer channels: consumer, commercial and carrier customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Positioning ourselves as a single point of contact for our customers’ communications needs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing customers with a broad array of voice, data and video services and bundling these services whenever possible;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identifying and broadening our commercial customer needs by developing solutions and providing integrated service offerings;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Providing excellent customer service, including 24/7 centralized customer support to coordinate installation of new services, repair and maintenance functions and creating more self-service tools through our online customer portal;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing and delivering new services to meet evolving customer needs and market demands; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leveraging brand recognition across all market areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 We currently offer our services through customer service call centers, our website, communication centers, commissioned sales representatives and third-party sales agents.  Our customer service call centers and dedicated sales teams serve as the primary sales channels for consumer, business and carrier services.  Our sales efforts are supported by direct mail, bill inserts, radio, television and internet advertising, public relations activities, community events and website promotions.
     We market our services both individually and as bundled services, including our triple-play offering of voice, data and video services.  By bundling our service offerings, we are able to offer and sell a more complete and competitive package of services, which we believe simultaneously increases our average revenue per user (“ARPU”) and adds value for the consumer.  We also believe that bundling leads to increased customer loyalty and retention.
     Network Architecture and Technology
     We have made significant investments in our technologically advanced telecommunications networks and continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers.  As a result, we are able to deliver high-quality, reliable data, video and voice services in the markets we serve.  Our wide-ranging network and extensive use of fiber provide an easy reach into existing and new areas.  By bringing the fiber network closer to the customer premises, we can increase our service offerings, quality and bandwidth services.  Our existing network enables us to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing amount of wireless data devices in our customers’ homes and businesses.
     Our networks are supported by advanced 100% digital switches, with a core fiber network connecting all remote exchanges.  We continue to enhance our copper network to increase bandwidth in order to provide additional products and services to our marketable homes.  In addition to our copper plant enhancements, we have deployed fiber-optic cable extensively throughout our network, resulting in a 100% fiber backbone network that supports all of the inter-office and host-remote links, as well as the majority of business parks within our service areas.  In addition, this fiber infrastructure provides the connectivity required to provide broadband and long-distance services to our residential and commercial customers.  Our fiber network utilizes fiber-to-the-home (“FTTH”) and fiber-to-the-node (“FTTN”) networks to offer bundled residential and commercial services.  
     We operate fiber networks which we own or have entered into long-term leases for fiber network access.  At December 31, 2018, our fiber-optic network consisted of approximately 37,000 route-miles, which includes approximately 19,430 route miles of fiber located in the northern New England area, approximately 3,700 miles of fiber network in Minnesota and surrounding areas, approximately 4,220 miles of fiber network in Texas including an expansion into the greater Dallas/Fort Worth market, approximately 1,700 route-miles of fiber-optic facilities in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, approximately 1,850 miles of fiber network in Illinois, approximately 1,160 route-miles of fiber optic facilities in California that cover large parts of the greater Sacramento metropolitan area and approximately 770 route-miles of fiber optic facilities in Kansas City that service the greater Kansas City area, including both Kansas and Missouri. Our remaining network includes approximately 4,130 route-miles spanning across various states including portions of Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington.  
     We intend to continue to make strategic enhancements to our network including improvements in overall network reliability and increases to our broadband speeds.  We offer data speeds of up to 1 Gbps in select markets, and up to 100 Mbps in markets where 1 Gbps is not yet available, depending on the geographical region.  As of December 31, 2018, approximately 42% of the homes we serve on our legacy network had availability to broadband speeds of up to 100 Mbps.  The majority of the homes in our newly acquired northern New England service territories have availability to broadband speeds of 20 Mbps or less.  As part of our integration initiatives in 2018, we upgraded broadband speeds to more than 500,000 homes and small businesses across the northern New England service area.  The upgrades enable customers to receive broadband speeds up to three times the speeds previously available.
     Through our extensive fiber network, we are also able to support the increased demand on wireless carriers for data bandwidth.  In all the markets we serve, we have launched initiatives to support fiber backhaul services to cell sites.  As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,391 cell sites in service and an additional 316 scheduled for completion in 2019.

 Business Strategies
     Diversify revenues and increase revenues per customer
     We continue to transform our business and diversify our revenue streams as we adapt to changes in the regulatory environment and advances in technology.  As a result of acquisitions, our wireless partnerships and increases in the demand for data services, we continue to reduce our reliance on subsidies and access revenue.  Utilizing our existing network and strategic network expansion initiatives, we are able to acquire and serve a more diversified business customer base and create new long-term revenue streams such as wireless carrier backhaul services.  We will continue to focus on growing our broadband and commercial services through the expansion and extension of our fiber network to communities and corridors near our primary fiber routes where we believe we can offer competitive services and increase market share.
     We also continue to focus on increasing our revenue per customer, primarily by improving our data market penetration, increasing the sale of other value-added services and encouraging customers to subscribe to our service bundles.
     Improve operating efficiency
     We continue to seek to improve operating efficiency through technology, better practices and procedures and through cost containment measures.  In recent years, we have made significant operational improvements in our business through the centralization of work groups, processes and systems, which has resulted in significant cost savings and reductions in headcount.  Because of these efficiencies, we are better able to deliver a consistent customer experience, service our customers in a more cost-effective manner and lower our cost structure.  We continue to evaluate our operations in order to align our cost structure with operating revenues while continuing to launch new products and improve the overall customer experience.
     Maintain capital expenditure discipline
     Across all of our service territories, we have successfully managed capital expenditures to optimize returns through disciplined planning and targeted investment of capital.  For example, investments in our networks allows significant flexibility to expand our commercial footprint, offer new service offerings and provide services in a cost-efficient manner while maintaining our reputation as a high-quality service provider.  We will continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives to expand our fiber network to new markets and customers in order to optimize new business, backhaul and wholesale opportunities.
     Pursue selective acquisitions
     We have in the past taken, and expect to continue to take in the future, a disciplined approach in pursuing company acquisitions. When we evaluate potential transactions, important factors include:
    
· | The market;
--+------------


· | The quality of the network;
--+----------------------------


· | The ability to integrate the acquired company efficiently;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Existence of significant potential operating synergies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Whether the transaction will be cash flow accretive.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

      We believe all of the above criteria were met in connection with our acquisition of FairPoint in 2017.  In the long term, we believe that this transaction will give us additional scale and will better position us financially, strategically and competitively to pursue additional acquisitions.
     Competition
     The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive competition, which has increased significantly in recent years.  Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available.  In addition, differences in 

 
  8

 
the regulatory environment applicable to comparable alternative services have lowered costs for these competitors.  As a result, we face heightened competition but also have new opportunities to grow our broadband business.  Our competitors vary by market and may include other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies; cable operators offering video, data and VoIP products; wireless carriers; long distance providers; satellite companies; Internet service providers, online video providers and in some cases new forms of providers who are able to offer a broad range of competitive services.  We expect competition to remain a significant factor affecting our operating results and that the nature and extent of that competition will continue to increase in the future.  See Part I - Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business”.
     Depending on the market area, we compete against AT&T and a number of other carriers, as well as Comcast, Mediacom, Armstrong, Suddenlink and NewWave Communications, in both the commercial and consumer markets.  Google also offers data and video services in a limited, but growing, number of service areas including the Kansas City market.  Our competitors offer traditional telecommunications services as well as IP-based services and other emerging data-based services. Our competitors continue to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services comparable to the services we offer. 
     We continue to face competition from wireless and other fiber data providers as the demand for substitute communication services, such as wireless phones and data devices, continues to increase.  Customers are increasingly foregoing traditional telephone services and land-based Internet service and relying exclusively on wireless service.  Wireless companies are aggressively developing networks using next-generation data technologies in order to provide increasingly faster data speeds to their customers.  In addition, the expanded availability for free or lower cost services, such as video over the Internet, complimentary Wi-Fi service and other streaming devices has increased competition among other providers including online digital distributors for our video and data services.  In order to meet the competition, we have responded by continuing to invest in our network and business operations in order to offer new and enhanced services including faster broadband speeds and providing additional over-the-top video content.
     In our rural markets, services are more costly to provide than services in urban areas as a lower customer density necessitates higher capital expenditures on a per-customer basis.  As a result, it generally is not economically viable for new entrants to overlap existing networks in rural territories.  Despite the barriers to entry, rural telephone companies still face significant competition from wireless and video providers and, to a lesser extent, competitive telephone companies.
     Our other lines of business are subject to substantial competition from local, regional and national competitors.  In particular, our wholesale and transport business serves other interexchange carriers and we compete with a variety of service providers including incumbent and competitive local telephone companies and other fiber data companies.  For our business systems products, we compete with other equipment providers or value added resellers, network providers, incumbent and competitive local telephone companies, and with cloud and data hosting service providers.
     We expect that competition in all of our businesses will continue to intensify as new technologies and changes in consumer behavior continue to emerge.
     Regulatory Environment
     The following summary does not describe all existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting the telecommunications industry.  Regulation can change rapidly and ongoing proceedings and hearings could alter the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates.  We cannot predict the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us.  See Part I – Item 1A – “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business”.     Overview
     Our revenues, which include revenues from such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service, are subject to broad federal and/or state regulation and are derived from various sources, including: 
 | Business and residential subscribers of basic exchange services; 
 | Surcharges mandated by state commissions and the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”);

 
  9

 

 | Long-distance carriers for network access service; 
 | Competitive access providers and commercial customers for network access service; and
 | Support payments from federal or state programs. 

       The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation.  Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Telecommunications Act”), federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices. 
      At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications.  The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies.  Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations. 
      State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers’ facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications.  In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies.  In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks.  State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations. 
     Federal Regulation
     Our incumbent local exchange companies and competitive local exchange companies must comply with the Communications Act of 1934, which requires, among other things, that telecommunications carriers offer services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions.  The 1996 amendments to the Communications Act (contained in the Telecommunications Act discussed below) dramatically changed, and likely will continue to change, the landscape of the industry.     Removal of Entry Barriers
     The Telecommunications Act imposes a number of interconnection and other requirements on all local communications providers.  All telecommunications carriers have a duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.  All local exchange carriers, including our competitive and incumbent local exchange companies, are required to:
· | Allow other carriers to resell their services;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | Provide number portability where feasible;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | Ensure dialing parity, meaning that consumers can choose their default local or long-distance telephone company without having to dial additional digits;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensure that competitors’ customers receive non-discriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator service, directory assistance and directory listings;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Afford competitors access to telephone poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish reciprocal compensation arrangements with other carriers for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  10

 

 Furthermore, the Telecommunications Act imposes on incumbent telephone companies (other than rural telephone companies that maintain their so-called “rural exemption” as many of our subsidiaries do) additional obligations to:
    
· | Negotiate interconnection agreements with other carriers in good faith;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interconnect their facilities and equipment with any requesting telecommunications carrier, at any technically feasible point, at non-discriminatory rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offer their retail services to other carriers for resale at discounted wholesale rates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provide reasonable notice of changes in the information necessary for transmission and routing of services over the incumbent telephone company’s facilities or in the information necessary for interoperability; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provide, at rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and non-discriminatory, for the physical collocation of other carriers’ equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements (“UNEs”) at the premises of the incumbent telephone company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Access Charges
     On November 18, 2011, the FCC released its comprehensive order on intercarrier compensation (“ICC”) and universal service reform.  See “FCC Access Charge and Universal Service Reform Order” below for detailed discussion on the FCC order.
     A significant portion of our incumbent local exchange companies’ revenues come from network access charges paid by long-distance and other carriers for using our companies’ local telephone facilities for originating or terminating calls within our service areas.  The amount of network access revenues our rural telephone companies receive is based on rates set or approved by federal and state regulatory commissions, and these rates are subject to change at any time.
     Intrastate network access charges are regulated by state commissions.  The FCC order on ICC and universal service reform required terminating state access charges to mirror terminating interstate access charges, and as of July 1, 2013, all terminating switched intrastate access charges mirror interstate access charges.
     The FCC regulates the prices we may charge for the use of our local telephone facilities to originate or terminate interstate and international calls. However, for purposes of the universal service funding they are regulated under the rules for price cap carriers.  The FCC has structured these prices as a combination of flat monthly charges paid by customers and both usage-sensitive (per-minute) charges and flat monthly charges paid by long-distance or other carriers.
     The FCC regulates interstate network access charges by imposing price caps on Regional Bell Operating Companies (“RBOCs”) and other large incumbent telephone companies.  Some of our former FairPoint properties operate as RBOCs under price cap regulation while some operate under rate of return regulation for interstate purposes.  These price caps can be adjusted based on various formulas, such as inflation and productivity, and otherwise through regulatory proceedings.  Incumbent telephone companies, such as our incumbent local exchange companies, may elect to base network access charges on price caps, but are not required to do so.  
     We believe that price cap regulation gives us greater pricing flexibility for interstate services, especially in the increasingly competitive special access market.  It also provides us with the potential to increase our net earnings by becoming more productive and introducing new services.  As we have acquired new properties, we have converted them to federal price cap regulation.
     In recent years, carriers have become more aggressive in disputing the FCC’s interstate access charge rates and the application of access charges to their telecommunications traffic.  We believe these disputes have increased, in part, because advances in technology have made it more difficult to determine the identity and jurisdiction of traffic, giving carriers an increased opportunity to challenge access costs for their traffic.  We cannot predict what other actions other long-distance carriers may take before the FCC or with their local exchange carriers, including our incumbent local exchange companies, to challenge the applicability of access charges.  Due to the increasing deployment of VoIP services and other technological changes, we believe these types of disputes and claims are likely to continue to increase.

 Unbundled Network Element Rules
     The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires incumbent local exchange companies to provide Unbundled Network Elements (UNEs) to competitive carriers, allowing such carriers entry into the local telecommunications market.  These unbundling requirements, and the duty to offer UNEs to competitors, imposed substantial costs on the incumbent telephone companies and made it easier for customers to shift their business to other carriers.  Competitive carriers continue to use UNEs to provide competing local services to customers in our operating areas.   
     Each of the subsidiaries through which we operate our local telephone businesses is an incumbent local exchange company.  The Telecommunications Act exempts rural telephone companies from certain of the more burdensome interconnection requirements.  However, the rural exemption will cease to apply to competing cable companies if and when the rural carrier introduces video services in a service area, in which case, a competing cable operator providing video programming and seeking to provide telecommunications services in the area may interconnect.  For our subsidiaries which provide video services in their major service areas, the rural exemption no longer applies to cable company competitors in those service areas.  Additionally, in Texas, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (“PUCT”) has removed the rural exemption for our Texas subsidiaries with respect to telecommunications services furnished by Sprint Communications, L.P. on behalf of cable companies.  Our ILEC subsidiaries still have the rural exemption in place, with the exception of Northern New England Telephone Operations and Telephone Operating Company of Vermont.  We believe the benefits of providing video services outweigh the loss of the rural exemptions to cable operators.
     Promotion of Universal Service
     In general, telecommunications service in rural areas is more costly to provide than service in urban areas.  The lower customer density means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring greater expenditures per customer to build and maintain.  By supporting the high cost of operations in rural markets, Universal Service Fund (“USF”) subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas.  Revenues from federal and certain states’ USFs totaled $83.4 million, $62.3 million and $48.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.       FCC Access Charge and Universal Service Reform Order
     In November 2011, the FCC released a comprehensive order on access charge and universal service reform (the “Order”).  The access charge portion of the Order systematically reduces minute-of-use-based interstate access, intrastate access and reciprocal compensation rates over a six to nine year period to an end state of bill-and-keep, in which each carrier recovers the costs of its network through charges to its own subscribers, rather than through ICC.  The reductions apply to terminating access rates and usage, with originating access to be addressed by the FCC in a later proceeding.  To help with the transition to bill-and-keep, the FCC created two mechanisms.  The first is an Access Recovery Mechanism (“ARM”) which is funded from the Connect America Fund (“CAF”), and the second is an Access Recovery Charge (“ARC”) which is recovered from end users.  The universal service portion of the Order redirects support from voice services to broadband services, and is now called the CAF.  
     The Order requires rate of return study areas associated with holding companies to be treated as price cap carriers for universal service funding.  For ICC purposes, these rate of return carriers fall under the rate of return ICC transition plan.  Price cap study areas fall under the price cap rules for both universal service reform and ICC reform.
     In 2012, CAF Phase I was implemented, which froze USF support to price cap carriers until the FCC implemented a broadband cost model to shift support from voice services to broadband services.  The Order also modified the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers.  The initial phase of ICC reform was effective on July 1, 2012, beginning the transition of our terminating switched access rates to bill-and-keep over a seven year period for price cap carriers and a nine year period for rate of return carriers, and as a result, our network access revenue decreased approximately $3.0 million, $2.8 million and $1.7 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
     In December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II funding for price cap carriers and the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding.  For companies that accept the CAF Phase II funding, there is a three year transition period in instances where their current CAF Phase I funding exceeds the CAF Phase II funding.  If CAF Phase II funding exceeds CAF Phase I funding, the transitional support is waived and CAF 

 
  12

 
Phase II funding begins immediately.  Companies are required to commit to a statewide build out requirement to 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream in funded locations. 
     We accepted the CAF Phase II funding in August 2015, which was effective as of January 1, 2015.  The annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million was replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020.  With the sale of our Iowa ILEC in 2016, this amount was further reduced to $11.5 million through 2020.  Subsequently, with the acquisition of FairPoint, this amount increased to $48.9 million through 2020.  With the sale of our Virginia ILEC in 2018, this amount was reduced to $48.1 million through 2020.  The acceptance of CAF Phase II funding at a level lower than the frozen CAF Phase I support results in CAF Phase II transitional funding over a three year period based on the difference between the CAF Phase I funding and the CAF Phase II funding at the rates of 75% in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year.  We accepted CAF Phase II support in all of our operating states except Colorado and Kansas where the offered CAF Phase II support was declined.  We continue to receive frozen CAF Phase I support in Colorado and Kansas until such time as the FCC CAF Phase II auction assigns support to another provider.  The FCC auction process for CAF Phase II funding occurred during the third quarter of 2018.  The winners of the auction have been announced and the impact to our future funding is expected to be determined in the second half of 2019. 
     The annual reporting requirements include (i) filings of annual certifications that the carrier is both meeting its public interest obligations and is offering comparable broadband rates and (ii) the filing of a Service Quality Improvement plan. The initial plan was required to be filed by July 1, 2016, with progress reports filed every year thereafter.  The plan must include, among other things, the total amount of CAF Phase II funding used to fund capital expenditures in the previous year and certification that the carrier is meeting the required interim deployment milestones.  The CAF Phase II build-out milestone for the end of 2018 was 60%.  This is measured separately by the Company’s operations in each state.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company met this milestone for all states where it operates.  
     The annual FCC price cap filing was made on June 18, 2018 and became effective on July 3, 2018.  This filing reflects incorporating the Consolidated and FairPoint holding companies, which changed the revenue threshold and amounts allocated to the price cap subsidiaries.  The changes allowed some properties to raise their access recovery charge rates and were offset by a decrease in CAF ICC support.  The net impact is an increase of $1.8 million in support funding for the July 2018 through June 2019 tariff period.
     Local Switching Support
     In 2015, FairPoint filed a petition (the “Petition”) with the FCC asking the FCC to direct National Exchange Carrier Association (“NECA”) to stop subtracting frozen Local Switching Support (“LSS”) from FairPoint’s ICC Eligible Recovery for FairPoint’s rate of return ILECs that participate in the NECA pooling process.  This issue is unique to rate of return affiliates of price cap carriers because such companies are considered price cap carriers for the FCC’s CAF funding, but remain rate of return for ICC purposes. Effective January 1, 2012, FairPoint rate of return ILECs were placed under the price cap CAF Phase I interim support mechanism, whereby the ILECs continued to receive frozen USF support for all forms of USF support received during 2011, including LSS.  The rate of return rules for ICC included LSS support in that mechanism as well; therefore, NECA subtracted the frozen LSS support from the ICC Eligible Recovery amounts in accordance with FCC rules prohibiting duplicate recovery.  When FairPoint accepted CAF Phase II support effective January 1, 2015, there was no longer any duplicate support and FairPoint requested NECA to stop subtracting LSS from FairPoint’s ICC Eligible Recovery.  NECA declined to make that change, which led to FairPoint filing the Petition with the FCC asking the FCC to direct NECA to comply with FCC rules on ICC Eligible Recovery for rate of return ILECs. This issue also applies to Consolidated’s operations in Minnesota, which are also rate of return ILECs associated with a price cap company.  The combined LSS support for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017 is approximately $12.3 million.  Our ongoing ICC Eligible Recovery support for 2018 increased by approximately $3.6 million, and thereafter, is expected to decline by 5% per year through 2021. On March 31, 2018, we obtained the required votes necessary for an approved order and on April 19, 2018, the FCC issued its order approving our Petition.  As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized subsidies revenue of $7.2 million and a contingent asset of $8.7 million as a pre-acquisition gain contingency for the FairPoint LSS revenue prior to the acquisition date.

 FCC Rules for Business Data Services 
      On April 20, 2017, the FCC adopted new rules for Business Data Services (“BDS”) which went into effect on August 1, 2017.  BDS services are high-speed data services provided on a point to point basis.  The rules apply to interstate BDS services in areas served by price cap carriers.  Under the new BDS rules, all packet-switched services and all transport services, channel terminations connecting wholesale customers to our networks and end user channel terminations in counties deemed competitive are competitive.  End user channel terminations for DS0, DS1 and DS3 services are non-competitive in counties deemed by the FCC to be non-competitive, but are eligible for Phase I price flexibility.  The FCC published a list of counties deemed competitive and non-competitive.  Geographic areas previously under Phase II price flexibility will not be rate regulated for any BDS services.  
     In our price cap operations, we can continue to offer competitive BDS services under tariff or we can remove the services from tariff.  All competitive services must be de-tariffed within three years of the effective date of the BDS rules.  We have complete price flexibility for BDS services deemed competitive.  As of October 23, 2018, the FCC issued an order giving rate of return carriers the option to elect a similar regulatory framework for their BDS services beginning in July 2019.  We are currently evaluating this election and will make a decision by March 1, 2019, as required by the FCC.
     BDS services are subject to vigorous competition.  We cannot determine the impact of the BDS rules on our revenues or operations.
     State Regulation
     We are subject to regulation by state governments in various states in which we operate.  State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate matters and other requirements. The following narrative is a summary of pending state specific regulatory matters.  We may have pending matters in other states not listed below, however, those matters are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.     California
     The California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) has the power, among other things, to establish rates, terms and conditions for intrastate service, to prescribe uniform systems of accounts and to regulate the mortgaging or disposition of public utility properties.
     In an ongoing proceeding relating to the New Regulatory Framework, the CPUC adopted Decision 06-08-030 in 2006, which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services, bundling of services, promotions and customer contracts.  This decision adopted a new regulatory framework, the Uniform Regulatory Framework (“URF”), which among other things (i) eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services, (ii) allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services, (iii) allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and (iv) eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation, including the calculation of shareable earnings.  In December 2010, the CPUC issued a ruling to initiate a new proceeding to assess whether, or to what extent, the level of competition in the telecommunications industry is sufficient to control prices for the four largest ILECs in the state.  Subsequently, the CPUC issued a ruling temporarily deferring the proceeding.  When the CPUC may open this proceeding is unclear and on hold at this time. The CPUC’s actions in this and future proceedings could lead to new rules and an increase in government regulation.  The Company will continue to monitor this matter.
     New Hampshire
     Effective August 10, 2012, the New Hampshire legislature enacted Chapter 177 (known as Senate Bill 48) (“SB 48”) in its Session Laws of 2012.  SB 48 created a new class of telecommunications carriers known as excepted local exchange carriers (“ELECs”) and our northern New England operations qualify as an ELEC in New Hampshire.  SB 48 essentially leveled the regulatory scheme imposed upon New Hampshire telecommunications carriers and states that the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (“NHPUC”) has no authority to impose or enforce any obligation on a specific ELEC that also is not applicable to all other ELECs in New Hampshire except with respect to wholesale obligations which arise from the Telecommunications Act, as well as certain obligations related to telephone poles and carrier of last resort responsibilities.  In New Hampshire, under SB 48, our exposure to annual service quality index penalties was eliminated 

 
  14

 
and we have pricing discretion with respect to existing and new retail telecommunications services other than basic local exchange service and certain services provided to customers who qualify for the federal lifeline discount.
     Texas
     Our Texas rural telephone companies are each certified by the PUCT to provide local telephone services in their respective territories.  In addition, our Texas long-distance and transport subsidiaries are registered with the PUCT as interexchange carriers.  The transport subsidiary has also obtained a service provider certificate of operating authority (“SPCOA”) to better assist the transport subsidiary with its operations in municipal areas.  Recently, to assist with expanding services offerings, Consolidated Communications Services, Inc. (“CCES”) also obtained a SPCOA from the PUCT.  While our Texas rural telephone company services are extensively regulated, our other services, such as long-distance and transport services, are not subject to any significant state regulation.
     Our Texas rural telephone companies operate as distinct companies from a regulatory standpoint.  Each is separately regulated by the PUCT in order to preserve universal service, protect public safety and welfare, ensure quality of service and protect consumers.  Each Texas rural telephone company must file and maintain tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for its intrastate services.
     Currently, both of our Texas rural telephone companies have immunity from adjustments to their rates, including their intrastate network access rates, because they elected “incentive regulation” under the Texas Public Utilities Regulatory Act (“PURA”).  In order to qualify for incentive regulation, our rural telephone companies agreed to fulfill certain infrastructure requirements.  In exchange, they are not subject to challenge by the PUCT regarding their rates, overall revenues, return on invested capital or net income.
     PURA prescribes two different forms of incentive regulation in Chapter 58 and Chapter 59.  Under either election, the rates, including network access rates, an incumbent telephone company may charge for basic local services generally cannot be increased from the amount(s) on the date of election without PUCT approval.  Even with PUCT approval, increases can only occur in very specific situations.  Pricing flexibility under Chapter 59 is extremely limited.  In contrast, Chapter 58 allows greater pricing flexibility on non-basic network services, customer-specific contracts and new services.
     Initially, both of our Texas rural telephone companies elected incentive regulation under Chapter 59 and fulfilled the applicable infrastructure requirements, but they changed their election status to Chapter 58 in 2003, which gives them some pricing flexibility for basic services, subject to PUCT approval.  The PUCT could impose additional infrastructure requirements or other restrictions in the future, which could limit the amount of cash that is available to be transferred from our rural telephone companies to the parent entities.
     In September 2005, the Texas legislature adopted significant additional telecommunications legislation.  Among other things, this legislation created a statewide video franchise for telecommunications carriers, established a framework to deregulate the retail telecommunications services offered by incumbent local telecommunications carriers, imposed concurrent requirements to reduce intrastate access charges and directed the PUCT to initiate a study of the Texas Universal Service Fund.  
     Texas Universal Service
     The Texas Universal Service Fund is administered by the NECA.  PURA directs the PUCT to adopt and enforce rules requiring local exchange carriers to contribute to a state universal service fund that helps telecommunications providers offer basic local telecommunications service at reasonable rates in high-cost rural areas.  The Texas Universal Service Fund is also used to reimburse telecommunications providers for revenues lost for providing lifeline service.  Our Texas rural telephone companies receive disbursements from this fund.  
     Our Texas ILECs have historically received support from two state funds, the small and rural incumbent local exchange company plan High Cost Fund (“HCF”) and the high cost assistance fund (“HCAF”).  The HCF is a line-based fund used to keep local rates low.  The rate is applied on all residential lines and up to five single business lines.  The amount we receive from the HCAF is a frozen monthly amount that was originally developed to offset high intrastate toll rates.
     In September 2011, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 980/House Bill No. 2603 which, among other things, mandated the PUCT to review the Universal Service Fund and issue recommendations by January 1, 2013 with the intent 

 
  15

 
to effectively reduce the size of the Universal Service Fund.  This would be accomplished by implementing an urban floor to offset state funding reductions with a phase-in period of four years.  The PUCT recommended that (i) frozen line counts be lifted effective September 1, 2013 and (ii) rural and urban local rate benchmarks be developed.  The large company fund review was completed in September 2012 and the PUCT addressed the small fund participants in Docket 41097 Rate Rebalancing (“Docket 41097”), as discussed below. 
     In June 2013, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 583 (“SB 583”).  The provisions of SB 583 were effective September 1, 2013 and froze HCF and HCAF support for the remainder of 2013.  As of January 1, 2014, our annual $1.4 million HCAF support was eliminated and the frozen HCF support returned to funding on a per line basis.  In July 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the PUCT on Docket 41097, which was approved by the PUCT in August 2013.  In accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018.  However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow.
     In addition, the PUCT is required to develop a needs test for post-2017 funding and has held workshops on various proposals.  The PUCT issued its recommendation to the Texas state commissioners in May 2014, which was approved in December 2014.  The needs test allows for a one-time disaggregation of line rates from a per line flat rate, then a competitive test must be met to receive funding.  The Company filed its submission for the needs test on December 28, 2016.  The PUCT issued docket 46699 on January 4, 2017 to review the filing and a decision was granted in the second quarter of 2017.  The order eliminated per line support for two of our exchanges resulting in a decline in annual revenues of approximately $0.4 million in 2018.  All other exchanges continue to receive per line support.
     New York
     With the acquisition of FairPoint, we assumed grants from the NY Broadband Program (the “NYBB”).  In 2015, New York established the $500 million NYBB to provide state grant funding to support projects that deliver high-speed Internet access to unserved and underserved areas with a goal of achieving statewide broadband access in New York by the end of 2018. 
      FairPoint received and accepted award letters in March 2017 for grant awards totaling $36.7 million from the NYBB Phase 2 grants.  These grants supported, in part, the extension and upgrading of high-speed broadband services to over 10,321 locations in our New York service territory in 2018.  We account for the Phase 2 reimbursements as a contribution in aid of construction given the nature of the arrangement.  During the second quarter of 2017, a bid for Phase 3 grants was submitted by FairPoint, the final phase of the NYBB grants.  On January 31, 2018, the state notified us that we were awarded a portion of our Phase 3 bid.  However, based on a reduction in the number of locations awarded under the bid, we did not accept the Phase 3 grant.    
     To be eligible for the grant, the network must be capable of delivering speeds of 100 Mbps or greater in unserved and underserved locations.  As a condition of the grant, we are required to offer the NYBB’s Required Pricing Tier as a service option to residential users for a period of five years from completion of construction of the network.  This pricing requirement will provide for broadband Internet service at minimum speeds of 25/4 Mbps (download/upload). 
     FairPoint Merger Requirements
     As part of our acquisition of FairPoint, we have regulatory commitments that vary by state, some of which require capital investments in our network over several years through 2020.  The requirements include improved data speeds and other service quality improvements in select locations primarily in our northern New England, New York and Illinois markets.  In New Hampshire and Vermont, we are required to invest 13% and 14%, respectively, of total state revenues in capital improvements per year for 2018, 2019 and 2020.  For our service territory in Maine, we are required to make capital expenditures of $16.4 million per year from 2018 through 2020.  In addition, we are required to invest an incremental $1.0 million per year in each of these three states for service quality improvements.  In New York, we are required to invest $4.0 million over three years to expand the broadband network to over 300 locations.  In Illinois, we were required to invest an additional $1.0 million by December 31, 2018 to increase broadband availability and speeds in areas served by the FairPoint Illinois ILECs.  As of December 31, 2018, we met all of the regulatory commitments for 2018.

 Local Government Authorizations
     In the various states we operate in, we operate under a structure in which each municipality or other regulatory agencies may impose various fees, such as for the privilege of originating and terminating messages and placing facilities within the municipality, for obtaining permits for street opening and construction, and/or for operating franchises to install and expand fiber optic facilities.

     Our cable television subsidiaries each require a state or local franchise or other authorization in order to provide cable service to customers.  Each of these subsidiaries is subject to regulation under a framework that exists in Title VI of the Communications Act.
     Under this framework, the responsibilities and obligations of franchising bodies and cable operators have been carefully defined.  The law addresses such issues as the use of local streets and rights-of-way; the carriage of public, educational and governmental channels; the provision of channel space for leased commercial access; the amount and payment of franchise fees; consumer protection and similar issues.  In addition, Federal laws place limits on the common ownership of cable systems and competing multichannel video distribution systems, and on the common ownership of cable systems and local telephone systems in the same geographic area.  Many provisions of the federal law have been implemented through FCC regulations.  The FCC has expanded its oversight and regulation of the cable television-related matters recently.  In some cases, it has acted to assure that new competitors in the cable television business are able to gain access to potential customers and can also obtain licenses to carry certain types of video programming.
     The Communications Act also authorizes the licensing and operation of open video systems (“OVS”).  An OVS is a form of multichannel video delivery that was initially intended to accommodate unaffiliated providers of video programming on the same network.  The OVS regulatory structure also offered a means for a single provider to serve less than an entire community.  Our Kansas City operations in Missouri utilize an OVS that allows us to operate in only a part of Kansas City.
     A number of state and local provisions also affect the operation of our cable systems.  The California legislature adopted the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 (“DIVCA”) to encourage further entrance of telephone companies and other new cable operators to compete against the large incumbent cable operators.  DIVCA changed preexisting California law to require new franchise applicants to obtain franchise authorizations on the state level.  In addition, DIVCA established a general set of state-defined terms and conditions to replace numerous terms and conditions that had applied uniquely in local municipalities, and it repealed a state law that had prohibited local governments from adopting terms for new competitive franchises that differed in any material way from the incumbent’s franchise even if competitive circumstances were very different.  Some portions of this law are also available to incumbent cable operators with existing local franchises who compete against us.
     A state franchising law has also been enacted in Kansas.  While these laws have reduced franchise burdens on our subsidiaries and have made it easier for them to seek out and enter new markets, they also have reduced the entry barriers for others who may want to enter our cable television markets.
     Federal law and regulation also affects numerous issues related to video programming and other content.
     Under federal law, certain local television broadcast stations (both commercial and non-commercial) can elect, every three years, to take advantage of rules that require a cable operator to distribute the station’s content to the cable system’s customers without charge, or to forego this “must-carry” obligation and to negotiate for carriage on an arm’s length contractual basis, which typically involves the payment of a fee by the cable operator, and sometimes involves other consideration as well. The current three year cycle began on January 1, 2018.  The Company has successfully negotiated agreements with all of the local television broadcast stations that would have been eligible for “must carry” treatment in each of its markets.  
     Federal law and regulations regulate access to certain programming content that is delivered by satellite.  The FCC has provisions in place that ban certain discriminatory practices and unfair acts, and include a presumption that the withholding

of regional sports programming by content affiliates of incumbent cable operators is presumptively unlawful.  The existing FCC complaint process for program access for both satellite and terrestrially-delivered content is governed on a case-by-case basis.  The FCC currently is considering adopting rules that could make it less burdensome for competing multichannel video programming providers who are denied access to cable-affiliated satellite programming on reasonable terms and conditions to pursue and meet evidentiary standards with respect to program access complaints.  This proceeding remains pending before the FCC. 
     The FCC adopted an order banning exclusive contracts between affiliates where the programming is sent via terrestrial media, and banning certain other unfair acts, making it clear that the withholding of regional sports programming and high definition television programming by content affiliates of incumbent cable operators would receive special attention.  Unlike the satellite provisions, the new rules will not expire. 
     The contractual relationships between cable operators and most providers of content who are not television broadcast stations generally are not subject to FCC oversight or other regulation.  The majority of providers of content to our subsidiaries, including content providers affiliated with incumbent cable operators such as Comcast, but who are not subject to any FCC or Department of Justice (“DOJ”) conditions, do so through arm’s length contracts where the parties have mutually agreed upon the terms of carriage and the applicable fees.
     The transition to digital television (“DTV”) has led the FCC to adopt and implement new rules designed to ease the shift.  These rules also can be expected to make broadcast content more accessible over the air to smartphones, personal computers and other non-television devices.  Local television broadcast stations will also be able to offer more content over their assigned digital spectrum after the DTV transition, including additional channels.
     The Company continues to monitor the emergence of video content options for customers that have become available over the Internet, and that may be made available for free, by individual subscription or in conjunction with a separate cable service agreement.  In some cases, this involves the ability to watch episodes of desirable network television programming and to procure additional content related to programs carried on linear cable channels.  These options have increased significantly and could lead cable television customers to terminate or reduce their level of services.  At this time, over-the-top (“OTT”) programming options cannot duplicate the nature or extent of desirable programming carried by cable systems, and the market is still comparatively nascent, but in light of changing technology and events such as the Comcast-NBC transaction, the OTT market will continue to grow and evolve rapidly.
     Cable operators depend, to some degree, upon their ability to utilize the poles (and conduit) of electric and telephone utilities.  The terms and conditions under which such attachments can be made were established in the federal Pole Attachment Act of 1978, as amended.  The Pole Attachment Act outlined the formula for calculating the fee to be charged for the use of utility poles, a formula that assesses fees based on the proportionate amount of space assigned for use and an allocation of certain qualified costs of the pole owner.  The FCC has put a structure in place for pole attachment regulation that has covered cable operators and other types of providers.  The FCC has adopted new rules that apply a single rate to all providers who use poles, whether they are cable operators, telecommunications providers, or Internet providers, even if they use the attachment to offer more than one service. These rules only affect attachments in states where the federal rules apply.  States have the option to opt out of the federal formula and to regulate pole attachments independently.  Of the states we operate in, California, Maine, Massachusetts New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Vermont and Washington have elected to separately regulate pole attachments and pole attachment rates.  All of the other states in which we operate in follow the FCC regulations and federal formula.  The FCC decision has been appealed, and the ultimate outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted.
     Cable operators are subject to longstanding cable copyright obligations where they pay copyright fees for some types of programming that are considered secondary retransmissions.  The copyright fees are updated from time to time, and are paid into a pool administered by the United States Copyright Office for distribution to qualifying recipients.
     The FCC has so far declined to require that cable operators allow unaffiliated Internet service providers to gain access to customers by using the network of the operator’s cable system. The FCC also has considered the benefits of a requirement that cable operators offer programming on their systems on an a la carte or themed basis, but to date has not adopted regulations requiring such action.  These matters may resurface in the future, particularly as the OTT market grows.  In light of the fact that programming is increasingly being made available through Internet connections, some cable operators have considered their own a la carte alternatives.  Content owners with linear channels continue to provide greater “on demand” programming and offerings that maintain the value of their linear channels for customers.

     The outcome of pending matters cannot be determined at this time but could lead to increased costs for the Company in connection with our provision of cable services and could affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve.
     Internet Services
     The provision of Internet access services is not significantly regulated by either the FCC or the state commissions.  The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has authority to regulate Internet Service Providers with respect to privacy and competitive practices.  During 2017, the FCC adopted an order eliminating its previous classification of Internet service as a telecommunications service regulated under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  This effectively limits the FCC’s authority over Internet Service Providers.  The FCC retained rules requiring Internet Service Providers to disclose practices associated with blocking, throttling and paid prioritization of Internet traffic.  The FCC order has been challenged in court and the outcome of the challenge cannot be determined at this time.  
     The outcome of pending matters before the FCC and the FTC and any potential congressional action cannot be determined at this time but could lead to increased costs for the Company in connection with our provision of Internet services, and could affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve.
