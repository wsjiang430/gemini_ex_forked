ITEM 1 | BUSINESS

General
Johnson Controls International plc, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, is a global diversified technology and multi industrial leader serving a wide range of customers in more than 150 countries. The Company creates intelligent buildings, efficient energy solutions and integrated infrastructure that work seamlessly together to deliver on the promise of smart cities and communities. The Company is committed to helping its customers win and creating greater value for all of its stakeholders through its strategic focus on buildings.
Johnson Controls was originally incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1885 as Johnson Electric Service Company to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. The Company was renamed to Johnson Controls, Inc. in 1974. In 2005, the Company acquired York International, a global supplier of heating, ventilating, air-conditioning ("HVAC") and refrigeration equipment and services. In 2014, the Company acquired Air Distribution Technologies, Inc., one of the largest independent providers of air distribution and ventilation products in North America. In 2015, the Company formed a joint venture with Hitachi to expand its building related product offerings. In 2016, Johnson Controls, Inc. and Tyco completed their combination (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, Tyco changed its name to “Johnson Controls International plc.”
On November 13, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with BCP Acquisitions LLC (“Purchaser”). The Purchaser is a newly-formed entity controlled by investment funds managed by Brookfield Capital Partners LLC. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions therein, the Company agreed to sell, and Purchaser agreed to acquire, the Company’s Power Solutions business for a purchase price of $13.2 billion. The transaction closed on April 30, 2019 with net cash proceeds of $11.6 billion after tax and transaction-related expenses. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company determined that its Power Solutions business met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as a result, Power Solutions' historical financial results are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were retrospectively reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale. 
The Company is a global market leader in engineering, developing, manufacturing and installing building products and systems around the world, including HVAC equipment, HVAC controls, energy-management systems, security systems, fire detection systems and fire suppression solutions. The Company further serves customers by providing technical services (in the HVAC, security and fire-protection space), energy-management consulting and data-driven solutions via its data-enabled business. Finally, the Company has a strong presence in the North American residential air conditioning and heating systems market and is a global market leader in industrial refrigeration products.
Products/Systems and Services
The Company sells its integrated control systems, security systems, fire-detection systems, equipment and services primarily through its extensive global network of sales and service offices, with operations in approximately 70 countries. Significant sales are also generated through global third-party channels, such as distributors of air-conditioning, security, fire-detection and commercial HVAC systems. The Company’s large base of current customers leads to significant repeat business for the retrofit and replacement markets. In addition, the new commercial construction market is also important. Trusted Buildings brands, such as YORK®, Hitachi Air Conditioning, Metasys®, Ansul, Ruskin®, Titus®, Frick®, PENN®, Sabroe®, Simplex® and Grinnell® give the Company the most diverse portfolio in the building technology industry.
In fiscal 2019, approximately 26% of its sales originated from its service offerings. 
Competition
The Company conducts its operations through thousands of individual contracts that are either negotiated or awarded on a competitive basis. Key factors in the award of contracts include system and service performance, quality, price, design, reputation, technology, application engineering capability and construction or project management expertise. Competitors for HVAC equipment, security, fire-detection, fire suppression and controls in the residential and non-residential marketplace include many regional, national and international providers; larger competitors include Honeywell International, Inc.; Siemens Building Technologies, an operating group of Siemens AG; Schneider Electric SA; Carrier Corporation, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation; Trane Incorporated, a subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand Public Limited Company; Daikin Industries, Ltd.; Lennox International, Inc.; GC Midea Holding Co, Ltd. and Gree Electric Appliances, Inc. In addition to HVAC equipment, the Company competes in a highly fragmented HVAC services market, which is dominated by local providers. The loss of any individual contract would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Backlog
The Company’s backlog is applicable to its sales of systems and services. At September 30, 2019, the backlog was $9.2 billion, of which $8.9 billion is attributable to the field business. The backlog amount outstanding at any given time is not necessarily indicative of the amount of revenue to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” and as a result is required to disclose remaining performance obligations. At September 30, 2019, remaining performance obligations were $14.4 billion, which is $5.2 billion higher than the Company's backlog of $9.2 billion. Differences between the Company’s remaining performance obligations and backlog are primarily due to:

• | Remaining performance obligations include large, multi-purpose contracts to construct hospitals, schools and other governmental buildings, which are services to be performed over the building's lifetime with initial contract terms of 25 to 35 years for the entire term of the contract versus backlog which includes only the lifecycle period of these contracts which approximates five years;


• | The Company has elected to exclude from remaining performance obligations certain contracts with customers with a term of one year or less or contracts that are cancelable without substantial penalty while these contracts are included within backlog; and


• | Remaining performance obligations include the full remaining term of service contracts with substantial termination penalties versus backlog which includes one year for all outstanding service contracts.

The Company will continue to report backlog as it believes it is a useful measure of evaluating the Company's operational performance and relationship to total orders. 
Raw Materials
Raw materials used by the businesses in connection with their operations, including steel, aluminum, brass, copper, polypropylene and certain flurochemicals used in fire suppression agents, were readily available during fiscal 2019, and the Company expects such availability to continue. In fiscal 2020, commodity prices could fluctuate throughout the year and could significantly affect the results of operations.
Intellectual Property
Generally, the Company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements.
The Company owns numerous U.S. and non-U.S. patents (and their respective counterparts), the more important of which cover those technologies and inventions embodied in current products or which are used in the manufacture of those products. While the Company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, no single patent, or group of patents, is critical to the success of the business. The Company, from time to time, grants licenses under its patents and technology and receives licenses under patents and technology of others.
The Company’s trademarks, certain of which are material to its business, are registered or otherwise legally protected in the U.S. and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of the Company are sold. The Company, from time to time, becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions.
Most works of authorship produced for the Company, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating the Company’s claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Laws addressing the protection of the environment (environmental laws) and workers’ safety and health (worker safety laws) govern the Company’s ongoing global operations. They generally provide for civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive and remedial relief, for noncompliance or require remediation of sites where Company-related materials have been released into the environment.
The Company has expended substantial resources globally, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance. Certain of the Company’s businesses are, or have been, engaged in the handling or use of substances that may impact workplace health and safety or the environment. The Company is committed to protecting its workers and the environment against the risks associated with these substances.
The Company’s operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings for noncompliance with environmental laws and worker safety laws or for the remediation of Company-related substances released into the environment. Such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance, abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, payment of penalties. See Note 22, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters.
Environmental Capital Expenditures
The Company’s ongoing environmental compliance program often results in capital expenditures. Environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditure decisions; however, expenditures in fiscal 2019 related solely to environmental compliance were not material. It is management’s opinion that the amount of any future capital expenditures related solely to environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results or competitive position in any one year. See Note 22, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters.
Government Regulation and Supervision
The Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., in areas such as: consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Company operates have licensing 
laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. The Company's security businesses currently rely extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals. Wireline and wireless telephone companies in the U.S. are regulated by the federal and state governments. In addition, government regulation of fire safety codes can impact the Company's fire businesses. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect the Company's worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company's business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, the Company employed approximately 104,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 39,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 65,000 were outside the United States. Approximately 22,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and the Company believes that its relations with the labor unions are generally good.
Seasonal Factors
Certain of the Company's sales are seasonal as the demand for residential air conditioning equipment generally increases in the summer months. This seasonality is mitigated by the other products and services provided by the Company that have no material seasonal effect.
Research and Development Expenditures
Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for research and development expenditures.
