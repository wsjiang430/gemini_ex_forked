Corporate History
 
Formation
 
We were initially a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 17, 2017 under the name I-AM Capital Acquisition Company. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Although we were not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a business combination, we focused on businesses with a connection to India. On November 20, 2018, we changed our name from I-AM Capital Acquisition Company to Smaaash Entertainment, Inc. On January 2, 2019, we changed our name from Smaaash Entertainment, Inc. to Simplicity Esports and Gaming Company.
 
We are authorized to issue 21,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 20,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of August 27, 2019, there were 7,753,975 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.
 
Founder Shares
 
On May 31, 2017, we issued 1,437,500 shares of Common Stock (the “Founder Shares”) to I-AM Capital Partners LLC, our sponsor (the “Sponsor”), in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000. Upon the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option on September 13, 2017, 137,500 Founder Shares were forfeited by the Sponsor, for a balance of 1,300,000 Founder Shares held by our Sponsor.
Initial Public Offering and Private Placement
 
On August 22, 2017, we sold 5,000,000 units at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit in our initial public offering (“IPO”) of public units (“Public Units”), generating gross proceeds of $50.0 million. Each Public Unit consisted of one share of our Common Stock (“Public Shares”), one right to receive one-tenth of one share our Common Stock upon consummation of an initial business combination (“Public Right”), and one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrants”). Each warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
 
Concurrently with the closing of the IPO on August 22, 2017, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 254,500 units (“Private Placement Units”) at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,545,000 in a private placement. The Private Placement Units (including their component securities) are not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the initial business combination and the warrants included in the Private Placement Units are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or their permitted transferees.
 
On August 22, 2017, we issued 50,000 shares of Common Stock to Maxim in connection with its services as underwriter for the IPO.
 
Contained in the underwriting agreement for the IPO was an over-allotment option allowing the underwriters to purchase from the Company up to an additional 750,000 Public Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) and, in addition, the Company received a commitment from the Sponsor to purchase up to an additional 26,250 Private Placement Units.
 
On September 13, 2017, the underwriters partially exercised their option and purchased 200,000 Over-Allotment Units, which were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,000,000.
 
On September 13, 2017, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 7,000 Private Placement Units (the “Over-Allotment Placement Units”), generating gross proceeds of $70,000.
 
On September 13, 2017, we issued Maxim an additional 2,000 shares of our Common Stock upon partial exercise of the over-allotment.
 
On October 9, 2017, we commenced trading our Public Shares of Common Stock, Public Rights, and Public Warrants on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “IAM,” “IAMXR” and “IAMXW,” respectively.
 
The Founder Shares are identical to the Public Shares and holders of Founder Shares have the same stockholder rights as the holders of our Public Shares (“Public Stockholders”) which include our initial stockholders, including the holders of our Founder Shares prior to the IPO (“initial stockholders”) and members of our management team, including our executive officers and directors (“management” and “management team”), to the extent our initial stockholders and/or members of our management team purchased Public Shares, provided that each initial stockholder’s and member of our management team’s status as a “public stockholder” shall only exist with respect to such Public Shares), except that the Founder Shares and the shares of Common Stock (“Private Placement Shares”) forming part of the Private Placement Units are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

Otherwise the payment should be made in cash only.
 
So long as any amount under the Note is outstanding, all cash proceeds received by the Company from any sales of its securities will be used to repay this Note.
 
Convertible Note Payable
 
On December 20, 2018, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Maxim Group LLC (the “Holder”). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Holder agreed to surrender and exchange the Note in the amount of $1.8 million which was issued to Maxim pursuant to the Settlement Agreement (discussed immediately above). In exchange, the Company issued to the Holder a Series A-1 Exchange Convertible Note in the principal amount of $500,000 (the “Series A-1 Note”) and a Series A-2 Exchange Convertible Note in the principal amount of $1,000,000 (the “Series A-2 Note,” and collectively with Series A-1 Note, the “Exchange Notes”).
 
The Series A-1 Note bears interest at 2.67% per annum, payable quarterly and has a maturity date of the earlier of the closing date of the Acquisition (as defined below) or June 20, 2020 (the “Maturity Date”). The Company may pay the interest in cash or at its sole discretion, in shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. However, the Company may only pay the interest in shares of its common stock if (i) all the equity conditions specified in the note (“Equity Conditions”) have been met (unless waived by the Holder in writing) during the 20 trading days immediately prior to the interest payment date (“Interest Notice Period”), (ii) the Company has provided proper notice pursuant to the terms of the note and (iii) the Company has delivered to the Holder’s account certain number of shares of its common stock to be applied against such interest payment prior to (but no more than five trading days before) the Interest Notice Period.

The Series A-1 Note is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock (“Conversion Shares”) at an initial conversion price of $1.93 per share, subject to adjustment for any stock dividends and splits, rights offerings, distributions, combinations or similar transactions. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, the conversion price will be automatically adjusted to equal the arithmetic average of the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s common stock in the five trading days prior to the closing date of the Acquisition. The Holder may convert the Series A-1 Note at any time, in whole or in part, provided that upon receipt of a notice of conversion from the Holder, the Company has the right to repay all or any portion of the Series A-1 Note included in the notice of conversion.
 
Additionally, the Series A-1 Note will automatically convert into shares of the Company’s common stock on the earlier of the Maturity Date or the closing date of the Acquisition provided that (i) no event of default then exists, and (ii) solely if such automatic conversion date is also the Maturity Date, each of the Equity Conditions have been met (unless waived in writing by the Holder) on each trading day during the 20 trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the automatic conversation date.
 
At any time prior to the Maturity Date, the Company may also elect to redeem some or all of the outstanding principal amount for cash in an amount (the “Optional Redemption Amount”) equal to the sum of (a) 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the note, (b) accrued but unpaid interest and (c) all liquidated damages and other amounts due in respect of the note (the “Optional Redemption”). The Company may only effect an Optional Redemption if each of the Equity Conditions have been met (unless waived in writing by the Holder) on each trading day during the period commencing on the date when the notice of the Optional Redemption is delivered to the date of the Optil Redemption and through and including the date payment of the Optional Redemption Amount is actually made in full.
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Series A-1 Note, including, without limitation, an Option Redemption, the Company may not prepay any portion of the principal amount of the note without the prior written consent of the Holder.
 
The Company is not permitted to convert any portion of the Series A-1 Note if doing so results in the Holder beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the outstanding common stock of the Company after giving effect to such conversion, provided that on 61 days’ prior written notice from the Holder to the Company, that percentage may increase to 9.99%. However, if there is an automatic conversion, and the conversion would result in the Company issuing a number of shares in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation, then any such shares in excess of the beneficial ownership limitation will be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time or times, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation, at which time or times the Holder will be issued such shares to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation.
 
The Series A-1 Note contains restrictive covenants which, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability to repay or repurchase any indebtedness, make distributions on or repurchase its common stock or enter into transactions with its affiliates.
 
The Series A-2 Note has terms substantially similar to those of the Series A-1 Note except that the Series A-2 Note has a maturity date of June 20, 2020 and an initial conversion price of $1.93 which will be automatically adjusted to the lower of (i) the conversion price then in effect and (ii) the greater of the arithmetic average of the VWAP of the Company’s common stock in the five trading days prior to the notice of conversion and $0.50.
 
As of December 31, 2018, upon the closing of the Acquisition, the Series A-1 Note automatically converted into 193,648 shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
Amendments to Forward Purchase Agreements and Warrants
 
On December 20, 2018, the Company, Polar, K2 and the Escrow Agent, entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which, among other things, the stock purchase agreements with Polar and K2 were amended to (x) reduce the purchase price per share payable by the Company at the closing of the Stock Sales from $11.23 per share to (1) first $6.00 per share up to 20% of the original number of Shares (as defined in the respective Purchase Agreement), (2) then $5.00 per remaining share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, (3) then $4.00 per remaining share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, (4) then $3.00 per remaining Share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, and (5) then $2.00 per remaining Share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, (y) to extend the outside date of the closing of the Stock Sales until January 18, 2019, and (z) to authorize the issuance of $3,542,700 and $1,590,600 from the Escrow Account to Polar and K2, respectively, as partial payment for the Shares prior to the final closing of the Stock Sales.

Acquisition of Simplicity Esports, LLC
 
On January 4, 2019, the Simplicity Owners received an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock at the closing of the Acquisition and an additional aggregate of 700,000 shares of common stock on January 7, 2019. The Simplicity Owners are entitled to receive an additional 2,000,000 shares upon the Company’s receipt of the approval of its stockholders to such issuance. This provision was removed as the stockholder approval was only necessary due to the Company’s stock being listed on NASDAQ. Upon completion of the Simplicity Esports LLC acquisition, the Company decided that moving off the NASDAQ was appropriate and, the 2,000,000 shares are included on the balance sheet as common stock issuable to Simplicity Owners at February 28, 2019.
 
In connection with the acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC, on January 2, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate Amendment”) with the Delaware Secretary of State to change the Company’s name from “Smaaash Entertainment, Inc.” to “Simplicity Esports and Gaming Company”. In addition, the Company changed the ticker symbols of its common stock and public warrants to “WINR” and “WINRW,” respectively, and commenced trading of its common stock and public warrants under such new ticker symbols on the OTCQB on January 10, 2019.
 
Nasdaq Delisting
 
On December 10, 2018, the Company received a written notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Division of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company has not complied with the requirements of IM-5101-2 of the listing rules of Nasdaq (the “Listing Rules”).
 
The Notice stated that after its Business Combination, the Company had not demonstrated that its common stock met Listing Rule 5505(b)(1) that requires a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15 million. Additionally, the Company has not provided evidence that its common stock has at least 300 round lot holders as required by Listing Rule 5505(a)(3) and that its warrant has at least 400 round lot holders as required by Listing Rule 5515(a)(4). Finally, the Company does not comply with Listing Rule 5515(a)(2) which requires that for initial listing of a warrant the underlying security must be listed on Nasdaq.
 
On January 7, 2019, the Company received a second written notice from Nasdaq informing it that the Company failed to comply with Listing Rule 5250(e)(2) which requires companies listed on Nasdaq to timely file notification forms for the Listing of Additional Shares (the “LAS Notification”).
 
The Company was required to submit the LAS Notification 15 days prior to the issuance of the securities, however, the Company filed the LAS Notification for the issuance of the Series A-1 Note and Series A-2 Note and for the share exchange under our Share Exchange Agreement after such 15-day periods. Nasdaq notified the Company that each of these matters serves as an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities and that the review panel will consider these matters in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on Nasdaq.
 
Management of Simplicity Esports and Gamily Company has decided that moving from The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) to the OTCQB is more appropriate for the Company at this time, while the Company builds out its planned network of retail esport centers.
 
On April 1, 2019, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that it would delist the Company’s common stock and public warrants. The Company’s common stock and public warrants were previously suspended from trading on Nasdaq, effective January 25, 2019.
 
On April 2, 2019, Nasdaq filed a Notification of Removal from Listing and/or Registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 on Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the Company’s common stock and public warrants. As a result, the Company’s common stock and public warrants were delisted from Nasdaq effective April 2, 2019.
 
The Company’s common stock and public warrants currently have been quoted on the OTCQB under the symbols “WINR” and “WINRW,” respectively.

Recent Developments
 
PLAYLive Nation Merger
 
On July 25, 2019, the Company entered an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Esports Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), PLAYLive Nation, Inc. (“PLAYLive”), Duncan Wood, Robert J. Steinberger, Eric J. Charneski, Jordan C. Jenson, and Alec T. Carpenter (collectively, Messrs. Wood, Steinberger, Charneski, Jenson and Carpenter are referred to herein as the “PLAYLive Stockholders”), and Mr. Wood in his capacity as representative of the Stockholders (the “Stockholder Representative”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of PLAYLive by way of a merger (the “PLAYLive Merger”) pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into PLAYLive, with PLAYLive surviving the Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for 750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Merger Consideration”). The PLAYLive Merger closed on July 30, 2019.
 
The name of the surviving corporation remained “PLAYLive Nation, Inc.,” the Certificate of Incorporation of the surviving corporation is the certificate of incorporation of PLAYLive, and the bylaws of the surviving corporation are the bylaws of PLAYLive. The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the PLAYLive Merger became the directors and officers, respectively, of PLAYLive.
 
At the effective time of the PLAYLive Merger, by virtue of the PLAYLive Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, PLAYLive or the holders of shares of PLAYLive common stock, each share of PLAYLive common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the PLAYLive Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement was cancelled and extinguished and was converted automatically into the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of PLAYLive common stock as provided in the Merger Agreement. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of PLAYLive. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares continues to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of PLAYLive.
 
Promptly following the effective time of the PLAYLive Merger, the Company made available for exchange in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement that portion of the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement in exchange for outstanding PLAYLive common stock, provided, however, that the Company deposited into escrow 75,000 shares of Company common stock out of the aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise issuable to the PLAYLive Stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement as partial security for the indemnification obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the PLAYLive Merger. The number of shares of Company common stock issued to each PLAYLive Stockholder in connection with the PLAYLive Merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of Company common stock that otherwise would have been received by such holder) were rounded up to the next whole share in lieu of such fractional share.
 
At the closing of the PLAYLive Merger, PLAYLive was required to have not less than $10,000 in cash net of issued but uncleared checks, ACHs, and drafts, on deposit in PLAYLive’s principal bank account (“Minimum Cash”). Within 60 days after the closing date, the Company may deliver a notice to the Stockholder Representative setting forth a description of any item which caused Minimum Cash to exceed or fall below $10,000 and the actual amount of Minimum Cash on deposit in PLAYLive’s principal bank account as of the closing (a “Minimum Cash Adjustment Notice”). If the actual amount of Minimum Cash as of the closing is more than $10,000, then the Company will pay to the Stockholder Representative (for distribution to the PLAYLive Stockholders), the amount by which Minimum Cash exceeds $10,000 provided, however, in no event shall the cash payment exceed an amount that will permit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to qualify for the intended tax treatment. If the actual amount of Minimum Cash as of the closing is less than $10,000, then the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the PLAYLive Stockholders) will pay to the Company the amount by which Minimum Cash is less than $10,000.
 
Concurrently with execution of the Merger Agreement, the PLAYLive Stockholders executed and delivered a restrictive covenant agreement as provided in the Merger Agreement. At closing, each of Messrs. Wood, Jenson, and Carpenter entered into an employment agreement with PLAYLive, and each of the PLAYLive Stockholders entered into a one-year lock-up agreement with the Company.
 
The PLAYLive Merger is intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the Merger Agreement is intended to be a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code and for the purpose of qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes.

Smaaash Private’s game offerings are complemented by its in-house food & beverage services.
 
Smaaash Private launched its flagship Smaaash Center in November 2012, at Kamala Mills in Lower Parel, Mumbai, with a proprietary cricket game (obtained by Smaaash Private under a perpetual license from its founder and the patent-holder, Shripal Morakhia, for a one-time fee) as anchor attraction. Over the last five years, Smaaash Private has transformed into a multi-center integrated games and entertainment company, with a wide suite of in-house developed AR and VR and other games, as well as food and beverage options at each of the Smaaash Centers. Among other marketing initiatives, from time to time, Smaaash Private ties up with local athletes, sports icons and celebrities, including cricket, football, basketball and ice hockey players, to customize its games and increase their appeal to its customers, including via brand ambassadorships and game options designed around specific sports personalities.
 
Smaaash Private launched its first international Smaaash Center in December 2016, at the Mall of America in Minnesota, USA. Its star attraction in its U.S. Smaaash Center is a multi-level go-karting track and games developed and launched specifically for this Smaaash Center, keeping in mind local preferences, such as its ice hockey-themed game called “What the Puck”, and Active Games such as Super Keeper, Hoop Shot and Extreme Drone Racing, among others.
 
In fiscal year 2018, Smaaash Private acquired PVR bluO and SVM’s bowling and gaming assets to expand its footprint across India. The acquisitions added 20 Smaaash Centers to Smaaash Private’s portfolio.
 
Following the January 2019 acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC, we determined to shift our current primary focus to the Simplicity Esports LLC business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate generating any material revenues from Smaaash in 2019. The Master Franchise Agreement, as amended, and the Master Distribution Agreement continue in full force and effect, however, and we may now or in the future pursue Smaaash business opportunities.
