Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Marizyme, Inc., a Nevada corporation formerly known as GBS Enterprises Incorporated (“GBS, or Company”), conducted its primary business through its minority-owned subsidiary, GBS Software AG (“GROUP”), a German-based public-company whose stock trades on the Frankfurt Exchange. By December 31, 2016, the Company sold its controlling interest in GROUP and other subsidiaries, keeping only a minority interest in GROUP.
 
On March 21, 2018, GBS formed a wholly-owned subsidiary named Marizyme, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and merged it with GBS effectively changing the Company’s name to Marizyme, Inc.
 
On May 4, 2018 we exchanged all of our shares of GROUP for the shares of the newly formed X-ASSETS, to effect a Type-D business restructuring. We distributed the shares of X-ASSETS to the existing MRZM stockholders on September 5, 2018. As a result, Marizyme has no ownership of X-Assets.
 
The Company’s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) is currently quoted on the OTC Markets’ Pink tier under the ticker symbol “MRZM.”
    Historically, we grew our operations by acquiring companies which have developed software and specialized services for the Lotus Notes and Domino market. These products and services may no longer remain in use. New technologies, especially in the areas of Cloud Computing and Mobile applications, have grown in popularity due to the potential cost savings and operational efficiencies they can offer. The associated software and consulting offerings were no longer needed. 
 
In 2015, following an in-depth market investigation, we prepared to subsequently dispose of all other major shareholdings by way of sale.
 
In 2016, we prepared for our further restructuring. As a result, we sold our full investment in GBS Pavone GmbH effective as of December 1, 2016. We also sold our stake in GBS India as of December 31, 2016 by way of a management buy-out. These actions transformed the Company into a single corporate entity with no subsidiaries and prepared the Company for a new business model.
 
In 2017, we expanded our discussions on establishing a new business model in the biotechnology and/or life sciences sector and on September 12, 2018 we acquired our first biotechnology assets.

Current Business Focus
 
Going forward, the Company is focusing on the life sciences business and currently has acquired its first biotechnology assets. Marizyme is also seeking additional biotechnology assets to acquire. 
 
On September 12, 2018, we consummated an asset acquisition with ACB Holding AB, Reg. No. 559119-5762, a Swedish corporation, to acquire all right, title and interest in their Krillase technology in exchange for 16.98 million unregistered shares of Common Stock. These shares were issued to certain individuals and entities set forth in the asset purchase agreement. Krillase is a naturally occurring enzyme extract that acts to break protein bonds and has potential applications in dental care, wound healing and thrombolysis. 
 
Krillase’s activity is unique. Unlike many other enzymes currently approved to be used as enzymatic products, Krillase is the only product based on a co-operative multi-enzyme system involving both endo- and exopeptidases. The proteolytic enzymes of Krillase are composed of eight natural enzymes acting in a synergetic manner. They include: (1) Three serine proteinases with trypsin-like activity (two endo/exopeptidases, one endopeptidase), (2) One serine proteinase with chymotrypsin-like activity, and (3) Four exopeptidases (two carboxypeptidases A and two carboxypeptidases B). 
 
Krill enzymes are also unique in that they are mutually protected against the degrading effect of each other and they act in a two-step fashion when breaking down proteinaceous substrates. First, endopeptidases attack peptide bonds of the infrastructural parts of the polypeptide chains. The resulting peptide fragments are subsequently cleaved by exopeptidases into small peptides and free amino acids. 
 
Marizyme currently has 4 product candidates derived from the protease enzyme platform acquired from ACB Holding AB. The first product candidate is MB101 which is targeted to be used to debride and heal human wounds. MB101 is a clinical stage candidate which was tested in 13 human clinical stage studies conducted by ACB Holding AB prior to this drug candidate’s acquisition by us. In these studies, which were designed as Phase II efficacy studies and conducted in Sweden, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the Netherlands, more than 500 patients were treated for wound debriding and healing. No clinical trials of MB101 have been conducted in the United States. The second product candidate is MB102 which is targeted for acute cerebral ischemic stroke in pediatric patients. It is derived from the same protease enzymes that MB101 is comprised of. MB102 is in preclinical stage of development. In June 2018, prior to our consummation of the asset acquisition, ACB Holding AB filed a Pre-IND for MB102 and received an FDA letter giving advice towards an Investigative Drug Application for MB102, which we expect to file in late 2019. MB103 is Marizyme’s third product candidate and is in preclinical development. It is derived from the same protease enzymes as MB101 and is targeted to treat acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, in human adults. The fourth and last product candidate is MB104 which is targeted to treat deep vein thrombosis. It is in early preclinical development and is derived from the same protease enzymes as MB101.

Krillase received medical device status in the European Union for debridement of deep partial and full-thickness wounds in hospitalized patients, on July 19, 2005. Marizyme is currently investigating if a medical device status is still accepted as the Medical Device Directive was updated in 2007.
 
Other than planning activities, Marizyme has not yet begun any active business activities with respect to the development, testing or marketing of any of the four product candidates that we purchased from ACB Holding AB. 
 
Changes in Corporate Governance 
 
On May 7, 2018, Joerg Ott resigned as the sole executive officer of the Company. Mr. Ott, Mr. John Moore and Mr. Mohammad Shihadah resigned as members of the Board of Directors and they simultaneously appointed Mr. Nicholas P. DeVito as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. 
 
Effective September 13, 2018, Mr. DeVito resigned from the Board of Directors and as our Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Juan Francisco Gutierrez was appointed to our Board of Directors and as the Company’s President and Secretary and Marcos Nicolaides was appointed as the Company’s Treasurer. On September 14, 2018, Mr. Michael Handley was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Director by Mr. Gutierrez.
 
On December 6, 2018, Mr. Gutierrez appointed Mr. Terry Brostowin as a Board member and Mr. James Sapirstein as Executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Gutierrez also resigned on December 7, 2018 for health reasons and Mr. Nicolaides resigned as Treasurer.
 
The current Board is comprised of Mr. Sapirstein, Mr. Brostowin and Mr. Handley.
 
Subsidiaries
 
At December 31, 2017, all former subsidiaries have been closed or sold. On May 4, 2018 we exchanged all of our shares of GROUP for the shares of the newly formed X-ASSETS, to effect a Type-D business restructuring. 
We distributed the shares of X-ASSETS to the existing MRZM stockholders on September 5, 2018. As a result, Marizyme has no ownership of X-Assets.
 
Intellectual Property
    We acquired patents and patent applications in biotechnology pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated September 12, 2018, between ACB Holding AB, Reg. No. 559119-5762, a Swedish corporation, and Marizyme, Inc. As a result of this asset acquisition, Marizyme acquired the following patent and patent applications:

We generally control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we sold products do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad were adequate or that competition will not independently develop similar technology.
 
Research and Development
    We expect to continue to develop our planned biotechnology related operations, including expanding research and development, funding clinical trials, purchasing of capital equipment, hiring new personnel, commercializing our products, and continuing activities as an operating public company. This plan, discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, will depend on our raising additional capital and there can be no assurances that we will be successful in this endeavor.
Government Regulation
 
The product candidates that we, or our collaborators, are attempting to acquire and develop require regulatory approval to advance through clinical development and to ultimately be marketed and sold and are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic and foreign government regulation.
Competition
 
The competitive landscape in the information technology (IT) market and the enterprise data center market is intense and changing. Heavy competition in this space caused our software businesses to decline substantially and as a result we closed those businesses and will be refocusing on future acquisitions in the life sciences space if they can be found. 
Competition
 
The competitive landscape in the information technology (IT) market and the enterprise data center market is intense and changing. Heavy competition in this space caused our software businesses to decline substantially and as a result, we closed those software businesses and have refocused on acquisitions in the life sciences space. 
 
The medical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to significant technological change and changes in practice. While we believe that our innovative technology, focus on treatment of acute care issues, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from many different sources with respect to Krillase and our product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Possible competitors may be medical practitioners, pharmaceutical and wound care companies, academic and medical institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
    In addition, we face pricing competition from current standard of care “SOC.” The current SOC for eschar removal in severe wounds is surgery, where debridement can be performed by tangential excision, dermabrasion or hydro jet, or non-surgical alternatives, such as applying topical medications to the eschar to facilitate the natural healing process. Consequently, we face competition from surgical procedures and the only FDA approved enzymatic topical agent such as Smith & Nephew Plc’s, Santyl, a collagenase-based product indicated for the debriding chronic dermal ulcers and severely burned area and MediWound’s NexoBrid European approved product. 
    Although we are in the preclinical phases for our product candidates for debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds, if one of our product candidates obtains approval in the future, we would compete with traditional surgery and existing non-surgical treatments. In chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds, we expect to face competition from other debriding agents and wound bed preparation techniques, such as topical medication, mechanical debridement and surgery. We also cannot confirm at this stage of development that our product candidates, if approved, will be superior or comparable to Santyl, the only FDA approved enzymatic therapy for chronic dermal ulcers.

Revenues
 
Based on current market demands for modern, Cloud-enabled and mobile-device capable business applications, revenues for our former software business have declined substantially causing us to reevaluate our future direction. We are focused on acquiring life sciences assets although no assurances can be provided that we will consummate additional transactions. 
 
In the past, we generated revenue from subscription and usage fees and related services, including support and strategic consulting services. The subscription period was typically based on a yearly or multi-year contract with our customers. Our portfolio also included a set of analysis tools known as Insights that identified all of the Lotus Notes applications within an organization and provided metrics about the uses and users of those applications. 
 
We also generated revenue with our analysis tools by charging a fee for the use of our technology and for the associated cost of the services to produce a report and set of recommendations for the customer. Additional revenues came from consulting services that resulted from helping our customers to implement those recommendations. 
 
We believe there is no longer significant revenue opportunity in licensing these tools or selling consulting services to customers.
 
We do not expect to realize revenues from the life-sciences space in the short term and no guarantees can be given as to when revenues might begin, if at all.
 
Employees
    As of March 6, 2019, the Company has one executive officer, Michael K. Handley (Chief Executive Officer). 
    General Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on March 20, 2007 as SWAV Enterprises Ltd. (“SWAV”). SWAV had a different management team and was in a different industry. 
    On September 6, 2010, SWAV’s name was changed to GBS Enterprises Incorporated. On October 14, 2010, the Company’s trading symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board was changed from SWAV to GBSX.
 
On March 21, 2018, GBS formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Marizyme, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and merged it with GBS Enterprises effectively renaming the company Marizyme, Inc. 
 
On January 5, 2018, we received a written consent by the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Company approving a 1-for-29 reverse-split of our outstanding Common Stock. On March 20, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to effectuate the split on March 30, 2018. We completed this reverse split in the OTC marketplace on July 27, 2018. 
 
On May 4, 2018 we exchanged all of our shares of GROUP for the shares of the newly formed X-ASSETS, to effect a Type-D business restructuring. 
 
On August 8, 2018, our Board of Directors approved by written consent in lieu of a meeting as permitted by NRS and the Company’s bylaws to separate X-Assets from the Company by distributing the shares of X-Assets Common Stock owned by the Company to the Marizyme stockholders of record as of the August 21, 2018, subject to FINRA approval. FINRA approved the spin-off on August 24, 2018. The shares of X-Assets were distributed to our stockholders on September 5, 2018.
