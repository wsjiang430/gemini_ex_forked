Introduction
 Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (the “Fund”), a separate series of Invesco DB US Dollar Index Trust (the “Trust”), was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on August 3, 2006. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the “Trust Agreement”). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
  Invesco Capital Management LLC (“Invesco”) has served as the managing owner (the “Managing Owner”), commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund since February 23, 2015. The Managing Owner holds 40 general shares (the “General Shares”) of the Fund. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st.
 The Fund establishes long positions in certain futures contracts (the “DX Contracts”), with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Long USD Currency Portfolio Index–Excess ReturnTM (the “Index”), over time. The Index was renamed effective January 17, 2017. Prior to January 17, 2017, the Index was known as the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX®) Futures Index-Excess ReturnTM. The Index, as renamed, is identical to the Index prior to its name change on January 17, 2017. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of the sum of the Fund’s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations (“Treasury Income”), dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) (“Money Market Income”) and dividends or distributions of capital gains from its holdings of T-Bill ETFs (as defined below) (“T-Bill ETF Income”) over the expenses of the Fund.  
 The Fund may invest directly in United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund may also gain exposure to United States Treasury Obligations through investments in exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) (affiliated or otherwise) that track indexes that measure the performance of United States Treasury Obligations with a maximum remaining maturity of up to 12 months (“T-Bill ETFs”). The Fund invests in United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and T-Bill ETFs (affiliated or otherwise), if any, for margin and/or cash management purposes.
 The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of Trade®), under the symbol “DX.” The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts are related to the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Index. The Index provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (each an “Index Currency,” and collectively, the “Index Currencies”), which comprise the Index—Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc.
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the “Shares”) only to certain eligible financial institutions (the “Authorized Participants”) in one or more blocks of 200,000 Shares (“Basket”). The Fund commenced investment operations on February 15, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC) on February 20, 2007 and, since November 25, 2008, has been listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”).
 Index Description
 The Managing Owner pays Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. (the “Index Sponsor”) a licensing fee and an index services fee for performing its duties.

 Neither the Managing Owner nor any affiliate of the Managing Owner has any rights to influence the selection of the futures contracts underlying the Index. The Managing Owner has entered into a license agreement with the Index Sponsor to use the Index.
 The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. or any subsidiary or affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. (collectively, “Deutsche Bank”). The Deutsche Bank Long USD Currency Portfolio Index—Excess ReturnTM (the “Index”) is the exclusive property of Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc.

 No purchaser, seller or holder of the Shares of this Fund, or any other person or entity, should use or refer to any Deutsche Bank trade name, trademark or service mark to sponsor, endorse, market or promote this Fund without first contacting Deutsche Bank to determine whether Deutsche Bank’s permission is required. Under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with Deutsche Bank without the written permission of Deutsche Bank. 
 The Index Sponsor may from time-to-time subcontract the provision of the calculation and other services described below to one or more third parties.
 The Index is composed of notional amounts of each Index Currency. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the Index reflect a geometric weighted average of the change in the Index Currencies’ exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar relative to March 1973. March 1973 was chosen as the base period of the Index because it represents a significant milestone in foreign exchange history when the world’s major trading nations allowed their currencies to float freely against each other.
 The following table reflects the index base weights (the “Index Base Weights”) of each Index Currency as of March 1973 with respect to the Index:
  
Index Currency | Index Base Weight (%) | 
---------------------------+-----------------------+-------
Euro | | 57.60 | %
Japanese Yen | | 13.60 | 
British Pound | | 11.90 | 
Canadian Dollar | | 9.10 | 
Swedish Krona | | 4.20 | 
Swiss Franc | | 3.60 | 
Closing Level at Inception | | 100.00 | %

 The Euro was included in the USDX® in 1999 and replaced the following currencies that were originally included in the USDX®: Belgian Franc, Dutch Guilder, German Mark, French Franc and Italian Lira.
 Please see http://www.invesco.com/ETFs with respect to the most recently available weighted composition of the Fund and the composition of the Index.
 Index Calculation
 The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in the first to expire DX Contracts relative to the value of the dollar as of December 31, 1986 (the “Base Date”), which expire in March, June, September and December. On the Base Date, the closing level was 100.00. Although the DX Contract started trading in 1985, the Base Date of December 31, 1986 was selected because reasonably reliable pricing data was not available prior to December 31, 1986. A quote of “105.50” means the U.S. dollar’s value has risen 5.50% since the Base Date relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX®.
 The Index Sponsor calculates the closing level of the Index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis. The excess return index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts. The total return is the sum of the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts plus the return of 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills. The closing levels of the Index have been calculated using historic exchange closing price data of the DX Contracts since the Base Date.
 2

The use of long positions on DX Contracts in the construction of the Deutsche Bank Long USD Currency Portfolio Index–Total ReturnTM (the “Long Index”) causes the Long Index to rise as a result of any downward price movement in the DX Contracts. In turn, this appreciation in the long DX Contracts reflects the fall of the U.S. dollar relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX®.
 Since the Base Date, the Index closing level has ranged on a daily basis from as high as 100.58 on January 5, 1987 to as low as 51.94 on April 29, 2011. Past Index levels are not necessarily indicative of future Index levels.
 Index Rolls and Rebalancing of the USDX®
 The underlying DX Contracts of the Index are rolled quarterly over three consecutive business days starting on the Wednesday prior to the applicable IMM Date (each an “Index Roll Day”). “IMM Date” means the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, a traditional settlement date in the International Money Market.
 DX Contracts are rolled on each Index Roll Day as follows:
  
• | On each Index Roll Day, 1/3 of the DX Contracts that will expire on the next IMM Date are bought back and positions in the DX Contracts that expire on the IMM Date following the next IMM Date are sold long.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On each Index Roll Day, new notional holdings are calculated for the old DX Contracts leaving the Index as well as the new DX Contracts entering the Index.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On all days that are not Index Roll Days, the notional holdings of the DX Contracts in the Index remain constant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are no regularly scheduled adjustments or rebalancing of the USDX®. The USDX® has only been adjusted once, when the Euro was introduced as the common currency for the European Union (EU) bloc of countries. Without any other adjustments, the combination of components and their respective weightings in the USDX® have yielded performance results similar to other commonly used US dollar indexes, whether those index methodologies are based on trade weights or capital flow weights.

 Regulation
 Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and trading on those exchanges. 
 The Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC also regulate the activities of “commodity trading advisors” and “commodity pool operators” and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons’ activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a commodity pool operator (such as the Managing Owner) to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator if the CFTC finds that the operator has violated the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations thereunder and in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Managing Owner’s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the Fund. The Commodity Exchange Act gives the CFTC similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors, such as the Managing Owner. If the registration of a managing owner as a commodity trading advisor were to be terminated, restricted or suspended, the managing owner would be unable, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, to render trading advice to the Fund. The Fund is not registered with the CFTC in any capacity.
 The Commodity Exchange Act requires all “futures commission merchants,” such as the Commodity Broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers’ funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC.
 The Commodity Exchange Act also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
 Shareholders are afforded certain rights for reparations under the Commodity Exchange Act. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award 
 5

with the CFTC for violation of the Commodity Exchange Act against a floor broker, futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, and their respective associated persons.
 Pursuant to authority in the Commodity Exchange Act, the NFA was formed and registered with the CFTC as a “registered futures association.” At the present time, the NFA is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for derivatives professionals. NFA members are subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, market integrity, and consumer protection. As the self-regulatory body of the derivatives industry, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of derivatives professionals and disciplines those professionals who do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, and swap dealers, among others, and their respective associated persons, as applicable, and floor brokers. The Commodity Broker and the Managing Owner are members of the NFA (the Fund is not required to become a member of the NFA).
 The CFTC has no authority to regulate trading on foreign futures exchanges and markets but permits direct access to such markets from the United States with respect to foreign boards of trade that are registered as such with the CFTC.
 Employees
 The Fund has no employees.
