--------+---------

Overview 
 Vicor Corporation designs, develops, manufactures, and markets modular power components and power systems for converting electrical power (expressed as watts, and represented by the symbol W). In 
 
1 


  electrically-powered devices utilizing alternating current (AC) voltage from a primary AC source (for example, a wall outlet), a power system converts AC voltage into the stable direct current (DC) voltage necessary to power subsystems and/or individual applications and devices (known as loads). In many electronic devices, this DC voltage may be further converted to one or more voltages (expressed as volts, and represented by the symbol V) and currents (expressed as amperes, and represented by the symbol I) required by a range of loads. In equipment utilizing DC voltage from a primary DC source (for example, a battery) or a secondary source (such as an AC-DC converter), the initial DC voltage similarly may require further conversion. Because numerous applications requiring different DC voltages, currents, and varied power ratings may exist within an electronically-powered device, and system power architectures themselves vary, we offer an extensive range of products and accessories in numerous application-specific configurations. We believe our product offering is among the most comprehensive in the market segments we serve. 
 Our website, www.vicorpower.com, sets forth detailed information describing our products, the applications for which they may be used, and our suite of design tools. The information contained on our website is not a part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K and shall not be deemed filed under the Exchange Act. 
 We are headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, where our manufacturing facility is located. Our subsidiaries, VI Chip Corporation, VICR Securities Corporation, and VLT, Inc., also are located in Andover, Massachusetts. Our domestic offices are located in Santa Clara, California, Lombard, Illinois, and Lincoln, Rhode Island. Our two Vicor Custom Power subsidiaries, Freedom Power Systems, Inc. and Northwest Power, Inc., are located in Cedar Park, Texas, and Milwaukie, Oregon, respectively. 
 We have established individual subsidiaries or branch offices outside of the United States, which we call Technical Support Centers (TSCs), to conduct preparatory and auxiliary services in support of the Company. Vicor Japan Company, Ltd. (VJCL), our 92.5%-owned Japanese subsidiary, which is engaged in sales and customer support activities exclusively for the sale of certain products customized by VJCL for the Japanese market, is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Vicor B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in the Netherlands, provides logistical and administrative support for a limited volume of orders placed directly with the Company by customers in the European Union. 
 In 2018, our subsidiary, Picor Corporation, was merged with and into the Company, and its operations and personnel were reassigned. We continue to occupy the former subsidiarys facility in Lincoln, Rhode Island. Also in 2018, we closed Granite Power Technologies, Inc., a Vicor Custom Power subsidiary located in Manchester, New Hampshire, transferring its operations and reassigning certain personnel. 
 Our subsidiaries and their legal domicile are set forth in Exhibit 21.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The activities of all of the above named entities are consolidated in the financial statements presented herein. 
 Although Picor Corporation has been merged with and into the Company, we continue to report our operating segments as the Brick Business Unit, VI Chip, and Picor, reflecting our historical organizational segmentation and managements operational oversight. See Note 17  Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein for certain financial information associated with the operations and manufacturing activities of our reported operating segments. 
 The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1981. Shares of our Common Stock were listed on the NASDAQ National Market System in April 1990 under the ticker symbol VICR, and we completed an initial public offering of our shares in May 1991. 
 Our Strategy 
 Since the Company was founded, our competitive position has been maintained by innovations in product design and achievements in product performance, largely enabled by our focus on the research and development 
 
2 


  of advanced technologies and processes, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry, materials, and packaging. Many of our products incorporate patented or proprietary implementations of high-frequency switching topologies, which enable the design of power system solutions more efficient and much smaller than conventional alternatives. Our strategy emphasizes demonstrable product differentiation and a value proposition based on competitively superior solution performance, advantageous design flexibility, and a compelling total cost of ownership (TCO). 
 Power system performance is primarily based on conversion efficiency (i.e., the ratio of output power (i.e., watts) to input power) and power density (i.e., the amount of output power divided by the volume of the power system). Higher efficiency and density contribute to superior thermal performance, as the by-product of power conversion and distribution is heat, which must be dissipated in order to assure the performance of the power system solution itself and the overall system to which it is delivering power. Power system performance also is based on the electrical characteristics of the power system (and their effect on and compatibility with the customers application). Important electrical characteristics include transient responsiveness (i.e., the behavior of a power system to a voltage change) and noise profile (i.e., the level of electromagnetic interference created by power conversion). We believe the superior performance of our power systems is the most important element of our differentiation strategy. 
 Our strategy complements performance superiority with design flexibility (i.e., ease of use), as our products can be utilized individually or combined, given their level of integration, to create power system solutions specific to a customers precise needs. We articulate this positioning through our Power Component Design Methodology, an element of our differentiation strategy, which is our approach to providing our customers the modular products, design tools, and engineering support to enable the rapid design of advanced power system solutions and, thereby, accelerate their own product development cycles. Our value proposition is supported by a compelling TCO, representing the cost of acquiring and operating a power system over its useful life, driven by competitive product pricing and more efficient use of power. 
 Our earliest market focus was on telecommunications infrastructure, which uses a standard DC distribution voltage of 48V, the highest nominal distribution voltage that meets Safety Extra-Low Voltage (SELV) standard requirements while leaving sufficient margin for over-voltage protection circuits. While we offer products addressing other voltage standards (e.g., 28V for military applications) and a broad range of customer voltage requirements, we consider our core competencies to be associated with 48V distribution, which offers numerous inherent cost and performance advantages over lower distribution voltages. 
 Our strategy, competitive positioning, and product offerings, all based on highly differentiated product performance, have anticipated the evolution of system power architectures and customer performance requirements. Reflecting this, we categorize our products as either Advanced or Brick (referred to in prior reports we filed with the SEC as Legacy), generally based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which the products are appropriate. The Advanced Products category consists of our more recently introduced products, which are used to implement our proprietary Factorized Power ArchitectureTM (FPA), an innovative power distribution architecture enabling flexible, rapid power system design using individual components optimized to perform a specific conversion stage (i.e., function). The Brick Products category largely consists of integrated power systems (i.e., bricks), incorporating multiple conversion stages, used in conventional distributed power systems architectures (e.g., Centralized Power Architecture (CPA), Distributed Power Architecture (DPA), and Intermediate Bus Architecture (IBA)). 
 Given the growth profiles and performance requirements of the market segments served with Advanced Products and Brick Products, our strategy involves a transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in Advanced Products design and manufacturing, targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix, high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in mature market segments we serve with Brick Products with a high-mix, low-volume operational model.

 Our Products 
 Reflecting our Power Component Design Methodology, we offer a comprehensive range of modular building blocks enabling design of a power system specific to a customers precise needs. Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which the products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either Advanced Products or Brick Products. We also sell a range of electrical and mechanical accessories for use with our products. 
Advanced Products 
 We continue to invest in the research and development of power system technologies and product concepts addressing two accelerating trends, the first toward higher required conversion efficiencies, and the second toward more and diverse on-board voltages, higher performance demands of complex loads, and, in particular, higher current requirements of those loads. These trends are most visible in the microprocessor-based applications we target with Advanced Products, for which energy consumption, energy efficiency, processor performance, and computing density are critical priorities. Recognizing the performance and scale limitations of conventional power distribution architectures and products, we introduced FPA and a range of enabling products incorporating our latest advances in switching topologies, materials, and packaging. 
 FPA, which is focused on, but not limited to, 48V distribution solutions, increases power system conversion efficiency, density, and power delivery performance by factorizing (i.e., separating) the power conversion process into individual components, free of the design limitations and performance and scaling trade-offs associated with conventional power distribution architectures requiring additional conversion stages and higher component count. FPA implementation allows for a factorized bus voltage to be distributed efficiently to the point-of-load, at which the voltage is converted to the required lower voltage and higher current. In contrast to the 12V IBA distribution commonly used in computing, for the same power requirements, factorized 48V distribution reduces the number of conversion stages required, thereby reducing component count and conserving space, reduces system distribution losses, and delivers improved thermal performance, thereby reducing system cooling challenges. Such direct conversion also improves system responsiveness. As power requirements increase, the differentiated advantages of FPA increase, as our factorized power system solutions deliver unmatched system conversion efficiencies, power densities, thermal profiles, and application performance. 
 Our FPA implementations with supercomputer and hyperscale datacenter customers involve our PRM® (Pre-Regulator Module), to create a non-isolated, factorized 48V bus voltage at relatively low current, and our VTM® (Voltage Transformation Module), a current multiplier delivering the required high current to the central processing unit (CPU). A typical 48V server motherboard implementation of FPA, utilizing a PRM-VTM configuration to power a CPU requiring less than 200W, would typically deliver 1.8V and 95A average current, with far fewer components and far less required motherboard space than competitive, multi-stage solutions with lower system conversion efficiency. 
 In 2017, we introduced our next generation of power system solution, Power-on-Package, which was specifically developed to meet the computational performance requirements of artificial intelligence (AI). The microprocessors typically used in AI, particularly in more computationally demanding machine learning applications, are graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Both GPUs and ASICs, in contrast to CPUs, are designed for parallel processing throughput, not execution of complex instruction sets. As such, higher levels of average and peak current are required to achieve this throughput. Our Power-on-Package solution, a re-integration of the functions of our PRM-VTM configuration, consists of one Modular Current Driver© (MCD), providing high-bandwidth, low-noise regulation, and two Modular Current Multipliers© (MCMs), providing high performance current multiplication. Power-on-Package delivers unprecedented current levels to GPUs and ASICs, in part due to the placement of the MCMs directly on the substrate onto which the processor is mounted, thereby minimizing distribution losses associated with such high current. A typical Power-on-Package configuration powering a GPU requiring 350W 
 
4 


  would deliver 0.7V and 500A average current and up to 1,000A peak current, with unmatched power density, which is a critical requirement for small, area-constrained AI accelerator boards. We are unaware of any competitive solution offering such power system performance, as competitive solutions achieve increased power through additional, multi-phase conversion stages, which do not meet the space and thermal limitations of AI accelerators. 
 Our patented and proprietary technologies also enable a range of Advanced Products applicable to other market segments and power distribution architectures other than FPA. Within computing, these market segments include voltage distribution in server racks and across datacenter infrastructure. We also offer Advanced Product power system solutions for aerospace and aviation (e.g., for use in satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles); defense electronics (e.g., for use in airborne, seaborne, or field radar); industrial automation, instrumentation, and test equipment (e.g., for use in robotics and semiconductor testing); solid state lighting (e.g., for use large scale signage); telecommunications and networking infrastructure (e.g., for use in pole-mounted small-cell base stations); and vehicles (e.g., in autonomous driving applications, electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles). 
 Advanced Products are offered in various package formats across functional families. 
 Annual revenue associated with the sale of Advanced Products, representing the sum of third-party revenue of our VI Chip and Picor operating segments, was approximately 35.9%, 33.4%, and 24.4% of the Companys consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We anticipate the percentage of periodic revenue associated with the sale of Advanced Products will continue to increase, given our strategic and organizational focus and the relatively higher expected growth of the market segments we serve. 
 Brick Products 
 Brick-format converters provide the integrated transformation, regulation, isolation, filtering, and/or input protection necessary to power and protect loads, across a range of conventional power distribution architectures. We offer a wide range of brick-format DC-DC converters, as well as complementary components providing AC line rectification, input filtering, power factor correction, and transient protection. Wide ranges of input voltages, output voltages, and output power are offered, allowing end users to select components appropriate to their individual applications. The products differ in dimensions, temperature grades, maximum power ratings, performance characteristics, pin configuration, and, in certain cases, characteristics specific to the targeted market. 
 We also integrate these converters and components into complete power systems representing standard or custom AC-DC and DC-DC solutions for our customers power needs. We refer to such standard products as our Configurable product line, while our two Vicor Custom Power subsidiaries design, sell, and service custom power system solutions. 
 We market our standard Brick Products emphasizing mass customization, using highly automated, efficient, domestic manufacturing to serve customers with product design and performance requirements, across a wide range of worldwide market segments, which could not be met by high-volume oriented competitors. We focus on distributed power implementations, for which our brick-format products are well-suited, in market segments such as aerospace and defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (e.g., rail). Our customers range from independent manufacturers of highly specialized electronic devices to larger original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their contract manufacturers. Some of our Brick Product lines have been in production for over three decades, reflecting the long-established relationships we have with many customers and the long-standing suitability of our products to demanding applications. 
 Annual revenue associated with the sale of Brick Products, representing the sum of third-party revenue of the Brick Business Unit operating segment, inclusive of such sales of our Vicor Custom Power and VJCL 
 
5 


  subsidiaries, was approximately 64.1%, 66.6%, and 75.6% of the Companys consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 Competition 
 We believe our sustainable competitive advantages are: the differentiation of our Advanced Products superior performance and power densities, enabled by our patented and proprietary technologies; the advantageous design flexibility enabled by our Power Component Design Methodology; and a compelling TCO. We seek to position ourselves with customers across all market segments served in a manner that reduces our vulnerability to commoditization. However, the competitive characteristics of market segments we serve with our transitional strategy may vary. Across all market segments we serve, competition generally is based on product performance, design flexibility (i.e., ease of use), product price, and product availability. 
 Despite significant consolidation of our competitors in the markets we serve with Brick Products, the growth of large-scale, low-cost foreign competitors in the commoditized segments of those markets, and increased application overlap with vendors of solutions based on semiconductors and discrete components in the markets we serve with Advanced Products, the total global merchant (i.e., non-captive) market for AC-DC and DC-DC power conversion solutions remains fragmented. The markets we serve, among which some overlap exists for our Advanced Product and Brick Product categories, are made up of many large, diversified manufacturers, as well as many smaller manufacturers focused on specialized products or narrowly defined market segments or geographies. The markets we serve with Advanced Products, typically on a direct basis, are generally characterized by relatively extended and highly competitive design cycles, product life cycles of generally less than three years, and many competitors that are far larger vendors of integrated circuits and discrete components, often using price concessions to offset performance limitations. The market segments we serve with Brick Products, typically through sales representatives and distribution partners, are generally characterized by relatively short design cycles, relatively long (i.e., greater than three years) product life cycles, and, given the maturity of many markets and applications, degrees of commoditization and price competition. 
 Although numerous third party industry studies estimate the total global merchant market for AC-DC and DC-DC switching power supplies to exceed $20 billion of annual revenue, representing approximately two-thirds of the total annual consumption of switching power supplies (i.e., the sum of merchant and captive volumes consumed), the Company competes in smaller, well-defined commercial and military market segments and niches within those segments. We believe, based on these third party estimates, AC-DC power supplies represent more than 85% of the total merchant market, reflecting a wide range of battery charging applications, primarily in the consumer, mobile device, and office computing segments (commodity segments in which we currently do not compete, together representing more than 50% of the total merchant market). These third party industry studies set forth estimates of varying levels of annual, dollar-based, nominal revenue growth across the merchant market segments in which we compete. These studies indicate most of the market segments we serve with Advanced Products have experienced high single-digit and low double-digit growth over the past three years. These studies also indicate most of the market segments we serve with Brick Products have experienced low to middle single-digit growth over the past three years. 
 Based on our own assessment of the market segments in which we do compete, we estimate the Companys total addressable market opportunity within the AC-DC portion of the merchant market may be approximately $1 billion annually. However, because this market is particularly commoditized and customer applications generally do not require the superior performance of our solutions, we pursue narrowly defined niches for which our highly differentiated front-end products, notably the PFM© and RFM©, are well-suited and competitively superior, thereby reducing our served addressable market opportunity. Should we successfully penetrate these potentially high growth niches, we believe that our served addressable market opportunity in AC-DC should expand. We estimate our total addressable market opportunity within the DC-DC portion of the merchant market may exceed $3 billion annually. We estimate our served addressable market to exceed $1 billion annually, with a relatively high dollar and unit volume growth forecast for the market segments and niches we are pursuing with Advanced Products. 
 
6 


 Despite our minor share in the overall merchant market and the competitive presence of numerous, far larger vendors in the market segments and niches we serve with both Advanced Products and Brick Products, we believe we maintain an advantageous competitive position in those market segments and niches. Notably, we believe we have the largest share of 48V distribution opportunities within the segments of the computing market we serve. However, numerous competitors across these market segments and niches have significantly greater engineering, financial, manufacturing, and marketing and sales resources, as well as longer operating histories and longer customer relationships than we do. 
 Customers and Backlog 
 The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Product lines, we serve customers concentrated in voltage distribution in server racks and across datacenter infrastructure of the computing market, although we also target applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, industrial automation, instrumentation, test equipment, solid state lighting, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment). With our Brick Product lines, we serve customers concentrated in aerospace and defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (e.g., rail). With our strategic emphasis on larger, high-volume customers, we expect to experience a greater concentration of sales among relatively fewer customers. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Companys order backlog was approximately $102,963,000, compared to $73,054,000 as of December 31, 2017. Backlog, as presented here, consists of orders for products for which shipment is scheduled within the following 12 months, subject to our scheduling and cancellation policies. 
 The lead times between receipt and acceptance of an order and our shipment of the product remained historically long through 2018, although overall conditions across the global electronics supply chain stabilized, allowing the Company to shorten production lead times for certain products in the second half of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we were quoting to customers average lead times of 14 weeks, consistent with the lead times quoted as of December 31, 2017, although during 2018 we quoted lead times as high as 20 weeks for certain products. We expect supply availability for certain materials and components to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we may further increase inventory levels for these components and raw materials, as necessary. Accordingly, we may not be able to reduce delivery lead times across all product lines for the foreseeable future. 
 A portion of our revenue in any quarter is, and will continue to be, derived from orders booked and shipped in the same quarter, referred to as turns volume. However, over the past two years, quarterly turns volume has steadily declined, reflecting lengthening lead times due to industry-wide supply chain uncertainties and a corresponding lengthening of customers planning horizons. An additional influence on turns volume has been our transition to larger OEM customers, which typically schedule large volumes for delivery over up to three coming quarters. While turns volume averaged approximately 41% of quarterly revenue for 2016, this quarterly average fell to 36% for 2017 and to 20% for 2018. 
 Marketing and Sales 
 We reach and serve customers through several channels: a direct sales force; a network of independent sales representative organizations in North America and South America; independent, authorized non-stocking distributors in Europe and Asia; and three authorized stocking distributors world-wide, Digi-Key Corporation, Future Electronics Incorporated, and Mouser Electronics, Inc. These channels are supported by regional TSCs, each offering application engineering and sales support for our channel partners. Domestic TSCs are located in: Andover, Massachusetts; Lombard, Illinois; and Santa Clara, California. International TSCs are located in: Beijing, China; Hong Kong, China; Shanghai, China; Shenzhen, China; Munich, Germany; Bangalore, India; 
 
7 


  Milan, Italy; Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Taipei, Taiwan (Republic of China); and Camberley, United Kingdom. Customers do not place purchase orders with TSCs, but do so directly with the Company or with our distributors. In Japan, customers place purchase orders with authorized distributors or, for certain products, VJCL. 
 We generally sell our products on the basis of our standard terms and conditions, and we most commonly warrant our products for a period of two years. Effective January 1, 2017, we extended the warranty period to three years for a range of H Grade, M Grade, and MI Family DC-DC products sold after that date. In a limited number of circumstances, we have entered into supply contracts with certain high-volume customers calling for extended warranty terms. With our distribution partners, we also enter into contracts providing for our product warranties to transfer to the end customer upon final sale of our product(s) by the distributor. 
 Because of the technically complex nature of our products and the applications they address, we maintain an extensive staff of Field Applications Engineers to support our own sales and customer support activities, as well as those of our channel partners. Field Application Engineers, based in our TSCs, provide direct technical support worldwide by reviewing new applications and technical matters with our channel partners in support of existing and potential customers. Product Line Engineers, located in our Andover headquarters, support Field Application Engineers assigned to all of our TSCs. 
 Our direct sales force focuses on higher-volume opportunities involving Advanced Products with global OEMs (and the Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and contract manufacturers serving these OEMs). Because of the high level of product differentiation and the increasing complexity and challenges of customer requirements, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, extended design cycles before production orders are received. 
 We also reach customers through the electronic commerce capabilities of our website, www.vicorpower.com. Registered, qualified customers in the United States, Canada, and certain European countries are able to purchase selected products online. We expanded these capabilities during 2018 to allow for higher-volume purchases, and we intend in 2019 to expand the geographic regions reached via our website. 
 Our web-based resources are an important element of our efforts to interact with and support customers. Within our website, PowerBenchTM is a workspace of tools and references allowing engineers to select, architect, and implement power systems using our products. During 2018, we continued to enhance our highly differentiated WhiteboardTM tool, which allows users to configure and analyze their own power system designs or those from an extensive library of designs addressing a wide range of applications. Users can modify the operating condition for each component of their design to match the intended application and perform efficiency and loss analysis of individual components and the full power system. We continue to enhance and expand the range and capabilities of engineering tools we make available online to customers and prospective customers. 
 As stated, our strategy involves maintaining high levels of customer engagement and support for design and engineering, which has resulted in significant expansion of our sales and application engineering infrastructure over historical levels, notably across Asia. We incurred approximately $42,533,000, $40,438,000, and $37,967,000 in marketing and sales expenses in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing approximately 14.6%, 17.7%, and 19.0% of revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 Manufacturing, Quality Assurance, and Supply Chain Management 
 Our 230,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility is located in Andover, Massachusetts, where we are headquartered. In this facility, we manufacture Brick Products, with the exception of custom products produced by our Vicor Custom Power and VJCL subsidiaries, and Advanced Products, with the exception of products designed and sourced by our Picor operating segment, which, given its fabless model, are manufactured, packaged, and tested by third party wafer foundries and packaging contractors in the United States and Asia. 
 
8 


 Our primary manufacturing processes consist of assembly of electronic components onto printed circuit boards; automatic testing of components; wave, reflow and infrared soldering of assembled components; encapsulation or over-molding of converter subassemblies and assemblies; final environmental stress screening of certain products; and product inspection and testing using automated equipment. These processes are largely automated, but their labor components require relatively high levels of skill and training. 
 We continue to make investments in automated manufacturing equipment, particularly for expansion of production capacity for Advanced Products. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we began the installation of equipment that, when fully qualified and operational, currently anticipated in the first quarter of 2019, is expected to increase our Advanced Products capacity by approximately 35%. Also in the fourth quarter of 2018, we began detailed development of plans to expand our existing manufacturing floor space by approximately 85,000 usable square feet. We plan to break ground on this addition to our existing plant in 2019 and take occupancy in 2020. The planned addition of multiple manufacturing lines in this additional space, across 2020 and 2021, is expected to increase our Advanced Products capacity by an additional 100%. 
 Our plans for the additional capacity do not include certain processes necessary for the manufacture of our SM-ChiP© line of surface-mounted converters. As previously disclosed, in December 2017 we began collaborating with a highly sophisticated contractor capable of meeting our near-term volume expectations with acceptable quality and cost. Through 2018 we expanded our relationship with this contractor, refining process steps and investing in specialized equipment for use by the contractor. As such, we have revised our schedule for taking such processes in-house, and expect to meet our forecast needs for SM-ChiP production with this contractor for the foreseeable future. 
 Product quality and reliability are critical to our success and, as such, we emphasize quality and reliability in our design and manufacturing activities. We follow industry best practices in manufacturing and are compliant with ISO 9001 certification standards (as set forth by the International Organization for Standardization). Our quality assurance practices include rigorous testing and, as necessary, burn-in and temperature cycling (i.e., extended operation of a product to confirm performance) of our products using automated equipment. Incoming components, assemblies, and other parts are subjected to several levels of inspection procedures, and we maintain robust data on our raw material inventories in order to support our quality assurance procedures. 
 Components and materials used in our products are purchased from a variety of domestic and international vendors. The global electronics supply chain stabilized in 2018, but lead times for delivery of certain raw materials required for the manufacturing of our products remain extended. Most of these raw materials are available from multiple sources, whether directly from suppliers or indirectly through distributors, and during 2018 we continued to opportunistically expand certain raw material inventories to offset the uncertainties associated with availability and lead times. 
 Our Picor operating segment, given its fabless model, relies on a limited number of wafer foundries and providers of packaging and test services. Our proprietary switching controllers were designed by and are sourced through Picor, which relies on these wafer foundries and service providers for supply continuity and sufficiency of these critical semiconductor devices. Similarly, many of the proprietary semiconductors we use, for which we have either a manufacturing license or ownership of the designs, are sourced from third parties through Picor. 
 To date, we have not experienced delays or reduced raw material availability as a result of trade disputes between the United States and China, including the imposition earlier this year of import tariffs under the provisions of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. § 2411) (Section 301 Tariffs) on certain Chinese goods imported into the United States. We have not incurred a material amount of tariff charges, either directly or indirectly, on our purchases of raw materials. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our competitive positioning has been, and will continue to be, supported by our long-standing commitment to research and development of power conversion technologies, advanced packaging and manufacturing, and 
 
9 


  innovative approaches to solving customer problems. Our research and development activities have resulted in important domestic and foreign patents protecting our products and enabling technologies, as well as proprietary trade secrets associated with our use of certain components and materials of our own design and proprietary manufacturing, packaging, and testing processes. We incurred approximately $44,286,000, $44,924,000, and $41,848,000 in research and development expenses in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing approximately 15.2%, 19.7%, and 20.9% of revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 We believe our intellectual property affords advantages by building fundamental and multilayered barriers to competitive encroachment upon key features and performance benefits of our principal product families. Our patents cover the fundamental switching topologies used to achieve the performance attributes of our converter product lines; converter array architectures; product packaging design; product construction; high frequency magnetic structures; and automated equipment and methods for circuit and product assembly. 
 As of December 31, 2018, in the United States, we have been issued 106 total patents. These patents have expirations scheduled between 2019 and 2037. We also have a number of patent applications pending in the United States and certain countries of Europe and Asia, including applications that would extend the life of current patents. We have vigorously protected our rights under these patents and will continue to do so. Although we believe patents are an effective way of protecting our technology, there can be no assurances our patents will prove to be enforceable in any given jurisdiction. 
 In addition to generating revenue from product sales, we seek to license our intellectual property. In granting licenses, we generally retain the right to use our patented technologies and manufacture and sell our products in all licensed geographic areas and fields of use. Licenses are granted and administered through our wholly-owned subsidiary, VLT, Inc., which is the assignee for our patents that may be subject to licensing. Revenues from licensing arrangements have not exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 976 full time employees and 31 part time employees. The number of part time employees varies throughout any year, largely based on the number of production shifts we may require at a particular time, as well as the number of college and graduate students participating in short term co-op programs. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Although there is strong demand for qualified personnel, we have not to date experienced meaningful difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient engineering and technical personnel to meet our needs (see Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors).
