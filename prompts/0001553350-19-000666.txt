GENERAL

Anvi Global Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 15, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of February 28. We formed the Company to commence operations in the business of selling crepes; however, we abandoned that business when control of the Company was sold by Tatiana Fumioka, on May 6, 2014. As a result, we are now controlled by Rama Mohan R. Busa, the principal shareholder and sole officer and director.

On May 24, 2018, as reported in a Form 8-K filed that same day, we entered into a Memorandum Of Business Association (MOA) with Team Universal Infratech Pvt. Ltd (TUI), pursuant to which TUI, a 12-year old Indian infrastructure development company based in Hyderabad, agreed to enter into a Joint Venture (the JV) with the Registrant, to execute the projects TUI is currently holding (as mentioned below), and also which may include TUIs future projects which are in the pipeline. The Registrant and TUI have agreed and proposed to create a legally valid joint venture entity (JV), with the Registrant having majority control of the JV stock and control of all operations of the specified projects which are executed pursuant to the JV.

The basic terms of the MOA are as follows:

TUI was awarded and currently holds the contract by the Airport Authority of India, an Indian Government organization, to construct a 400 meter (approximately 440 yards) long and 120 meter (approximately 130 yards) wide apron for aircraft and related pavement, at the CCC International Airport in Lucknow, India (the First Project).

TUI was also awarded and currently holds the contract by the National Highway authority of India, an Indian Government organization to construct NH-24, a 4-lane bypass starting from km 479.500 of NH 24 and terminating at km 17.600 of MDR- 77C (bypass chainage from km 64.900/64.380 to km 79.516/79.000 total length 14.618 kilometersapproximately 9.14 miles) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, India under NHDP Phase-VII on EPC Mode.

The total cost of the proposed projects is estimated at $58 million, and the investment for the successful completion of the project(s) is estimated to be $12+ Million.

TUI and Registrant propose to jointly execute the specified projects under a legally constituted (JV). TUI, with its expertise and experience in the field, will be responsible for operations by providing technology, technical teams, deployment of equipment and skilled manpower. The Registrant is responsible to provide the capital expenditures and operating expenses required from now on, which is estimated to be approximately $6.00 Million for successful completion of the specified projects.

TUI has already invested its share, which is approximately $6+ millions, through various heads-like acquisitions of the project(s), including the open tender process by the respective government bodies, earnest money deposits, performance guarantees, bank guarantees, deployment of equipment, technical teams, preparation of camp office, etc.

The Registrants responsibility is to raise approximately $6 Million in two phases: $3 million within sixty days and the remaining $3 Million within 120 days from the date of this MOA. However, on February 14, 2019, the date by which the Registrant is required to raise these funds was extended by mutual agreement for nine months, to November 14, 2019. To date, the Registrant has not raised any of the funds required by the MOA.

Assuming that the Registrant secures the required funding within the above time frames, which it intends to do in a debt offering, TUI will transfer the specified projects pursuant to subcontracts with the JV, to be legally created by both parties at that time, and the Registrant will then own small majority of the JV.

Assuming that the Registrant raises the required funds within the specified time, the Registrant believes that it will realize revenues from Joint Venture to be legally created by both parties in which Registrant has majority stock and through which specified projects are executed and revenues are realized.

The MOA with TUI also includes future projects in the pipeline being awarded to TUI, for which the financial requirements are being estimated.

The Registrant is now concentrating its efforts toward raising the debt financing required to fund the specified Projects, and is engaged in discussions with a few prospective investors. The Registrant is scheduled to meet with members of the TU team in June, 2019, for further proceedings.

The Registrants affiliated privately-owned company Anvi Global, Inc. (ANVI Private) has been actively pursuing mining opportunities in Zimbabwe. The Registrant has not entered into any definitive agreements regarding assets in Zimbabwe, as the Registrant still needs to assess the risks involved with doing business in that country, including possible sanctions which could be placed on the Registrant by the United States. 

Notwithstanding the risks, as part of the mining operations in African region, Registrant has received a sales advance of $137,910.00 in two deposits of $102,170 on 04-18-2019 and $35,740 on 05-29-2019 towards the supply of chromium ore from the unaffiliated South African-based company. It is intended that the agreement with the unaffiliated South African company will be signed, and the proposed sale of chromium ore will be completed, only if and when the regulatory hurdles have been resolved. 

Registrant has advanced $87,000 respectively as $50,000 on 04-3-2019, $10,000 on 06-03-2019, and $27,000 on 06-04-2019 to Anvi Private, towards the operating expenses involved in procurement and logistics of supplying the ore to the unaffiliated South African company from which Registrant has received sales advance.
