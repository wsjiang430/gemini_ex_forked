ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview



 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, developing our portfolio of proprietary Humaneered® anti-inflammatory immunology and immuno-oncology monoclonal antibodies. Our proprietary, patented Humaneered technology platform is a method for converting existing antibodies (typically murine) into engineered, high-affinity human antibodies designed for therapeutic use, particularly with acute and chronic conditions. We have developed or in-licensed targets or research antibodies, typically from academic institutions, and then applied our Humaneered technology to optimize them. Our lead product candidate, lenzilumab, and our other product candidate, ifabotuzumab (“iFab”), are Humaneered monoclonal antibodies. Our Humaneered antibodies are closer to human antibodies than chimeric or conventionally humanized antibodies and have a high affinity for their target. In addition, we believe our Humaneered antibodies offer further important advantages, such as high potency, a slow off-rate and a lower likelihood to induce an inappropriate immune response or infusion related reaction.



Pursuant to our previously reported strategic realignment plan, we are developing our lead product candidate, lenzilumab (“LENZ®”). Lenzilumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been demonstrated to neutralize human GM-CSF, a cytokine that we believe leads to the overproduction of monocytes which are thought to be responsible for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (“CMML”), a rare blood cancer and may be of critical importance in acute graft versus host disease (“aGvHD”) associated with bone marrow transplants. Our strategic realignment plans include accelerating the development of LENZ in CMML, for which the PREACH-M study is underway, and continuing our plans for the RATinG study in aGvHD, as these studies are majority funded by our partners. A leading network of centers, The Mayo Clinics, is currently progressing with an IIT of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapies. We are also developing iFab, an EpAh-3 targeted monoclonal antibody, currently in Phase 1 development, as part of an antibody drug conjugate (“ADC”), for certain solid tumors. 



Recent Developments



Our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund our operations for the remainder of 2023. Accordingly, as previously disclosed, we have been pursuing strategic alternatives and seeking to raise additional capital and settle or otherwise resolve payment disputes and other ongoing arbitration and litigation.



We have executed a non-binding letter of intent and are engaged in exclusive negotiations relating to a proposed business combination with a privately held biopharmaceutical company (the “Partner Company”). The proposed terms for the business combination contemplate a tax-free stock-for-stock merger, as a result of which we would issue shares of our capital stock to stockholders of the Partner Company which are expected to represent roughly two times the number of our currently outstanding shares of common stock.



We cannot assure you that we and the Partner Company will enter into a definitive agreement for the proposed transaction, and the final form and terms of any such transaction may be materially different from the terms described above. Our ability to enter into a definitive agreement is subject to conditions, including that we have received binding commitments for investment of additional capital that will be necessary to fund the operations of the combined company going forward and enable the combined company to maintain a listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another national securities exchange, as well as customary matters such as approval of the terms of the definitive agreement by the Partner Company’s board of directors and stockholders. Certain of these conditions will be out of our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that we will effect the proposed business combination and related financing transactions. If we are unable to complete the proposed transactions or identify and complete another strategic or financing transaction in the first half of 2023, we may elect or be required to pursue a reorganization or seek other protection under the federal bankruptcy code.



See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 22 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks surrounding the proposed transaction and our company.



Our Pipeline



Our product candidates are in the clinical stage of development and require substantial time, resources, research and development, and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Our pipeline is depicted below:

2022 Developments 



In July 2022, topline results from the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines-5 (“ACTIV-5”) and Big Effect Trial, in the “B” arm of the trial (“BET-B”), referred to as the ACTIV-5/BET-B trial, were released. The study was sponsored and funded by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and evaluated lenzilumab in combination with remdesivir, compared to placebo and remdesivir, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The topline results showed the trial did not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint, although the topline results did indicate that lenzilumab demonstrated a positive trend in mortality. A global group of leading institutions and research networks has indicated interest in including lenzilumab in their large-scale, multinational studies of COVID-19, pending an uptick in ICU admissions. Tocilizumab and baricitinib demonstrated mortality benefit following inclusion in REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY, despite having failed to do so in smaller studies. 



We are executing the strategic realignment plan to deemphasize the deployment of certain resources for the development of lenzilumab for COVID-19 and currently do not plan to pursue regulatory pathways unless further data from ACTIV-5/BET-B or a future large-scale study merit such an approach. The Named Patient program in select European Countries has been terminated. With the exception of the one lenzilumab batch in process, we have discontinued the manufacturing of lenzilumab and are consolidating the remaining inventory of lenzilumab bulk drug substance and drug product in a central location for potential future use.

Through partners in Australia, we initiated a study of lenzilumab in cancer patients with COVID-19. The trial, known as C-SMART was a multi-center, four arm trial, which aimed to evaluate several different immune modulating drugs for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the cancer population. The investigational product is in the process of being destroyed, due to COVID-19 being deprioritized by us and the Australian Government.



In May 2022, our partners in South Korea dosed the final healthy volunteer of the 20 required for their Phase 1 bridging study. This study was conducted to explore the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (“PK”) properties of lenzilumab and compare it between Koreans and Caucasians. The clinical study report has been completed and the degree of exposure was observed to be higher in Koreans than in Caucasians. Lenzilumab was safe and well tolerated in both Koreans and Caucasians. 



Lenzilumab in CMML and Related Hematological Cancers



Scientific Rationale



We believe that lenzilumab holds promise in CMML, a rare form of hematologic cancer with a three-year overall survival rate of 20% and median overall survival of 20 months. Standard therapies yield a complete response rate (“CR”) plus partial response rate (“PR”) in the 10-17% range. CMML is a clonal stem cell disorder of which monocytosis is a key feature. Clonal cytogenic abnormalities are commonly seen in CMML patients. RAS mutations, which make leukemic cells hyperresponsive to GM-CSF, are seen in approximately 50% of CMML patients and are the anticipated target patient population for lenzilumab. CMML has features of myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”), including abnormal, dysplastic bone marrow cells; cytopenia; transfusion dependence; and of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including overproduction of white blood cells, organomegaly (e.g., splenomegaly and hepatomegaly) and extramedullary disease. Independent publications have demonstrated the key role of GM-CSF and RAS pathway mutations in this and other cancers, including JMML, MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and AML.1,2,3



Our Development Program



In a Phase 1 study conducted by Mayo Clinic, three of six patients with NRAS/KRAS/CBL mutations demonstrated a clinical response to lenzilumab by the MDS/MPN International Working Group criteria. This study identified the Maximum Tolerated Dose (“MTD”) or recommended Phase 2 dose of lenzilumab, and assessed lenzilumab’s safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity. Final results of this study were presented at the 2019 ASH Annual Meeting and published in blood.



Building on this successful Phase 1 study in CMML, we are running a Phase 2 study in combination with azacitidine in newly diagnosed high-risk CMML patients who express NRAS/KRAS/CBL mutations which are known to be hypersensitive to GM-CSF and therefore may lend themselves to responsiveness to lenzilumab treatment. The Phase 2 study, known as “PREcision Approach to Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia” or “PREACH-M”, is being conducted in partnership with the South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute (“SAHMRI”) and the University of Adelaide. The study is currently enrolling at sites in Australia with additional enrollment anticipated at sites in New Zealand. As of March 16, 2023,  13 lenzilumab-treated patients have been enrolled in the study of a total of 15 patients and followed for multiple cycles, with what are believed to be encouraging results. An abstract for the PREACH-M trial has been accepted to the American Association for Cancer Research with a poster presentation scheduled for April 17, 2023.4 We are providing lenzilumab for this study and the majority of the study costs are being borne by the partner and funded by a grant from the Medical Research Futures Fund, a research fund set up by the Australian Government.



As a treatment for a rare disease, lenzilumab may qualify for certain regulatory and commercial benefits that may accelerate development and approval. We are assessing regulatory pathways that may enable early results to support a regulatory submission and potential approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, which could be expanded through Project Orbis, an international regulatory agency collaboration, to the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, we are evaluating approaches to FDA directly.

A clinical protocol has been developed for a study in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (“JMML”) an ultra-orphan and devastating condition affecting young children.



Our Commercial Opportunity



The incidence of new CMML patients in the US, UK, and Australia is about 1,700 patients annually.5 RAS mutations, which drive GM-CSF hyperresponsiveness, are also seen in additional myeloid hematological malignancies including JMML, myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) and acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”), totaling approximately 4,000 new cases annually in the US. We believe success with CMML may provide proof of principle for targeting RAS pathway mutations in myeloid leukemias with lenzilumab and allow us to develop, and if successful, commercialize lenzilumab ourselves or through a partner, in these additional patient populations. About 15 to 20% of CMML cases progress to AML. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 1,100 individuals in the US are newly diagnosed annually with CMML, with the majority of these new patients being age 60 or older. These patients are typically unsuitable for stem cell transplants.



For FDA approval, a confirmatory study in the US may be required and we plan to seek regulatory guidance from the agency with interim results from PREACH-M.



Pricing and reimbursement for rare diseases are traditionally higher than treatments for more common diseases. There have been no new therapeutic agents for patients with high-risk CMML in 30 years.6

Lenzilumab in Acute GvHD



Scientific Rationale



Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy (“HSCT”), a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers, involves transferring stem cells from a healthy donor to the patient. HSCT has demonstrated effectiveness in treating these cancers. Allogeneic HSCT typically involves multiple steps:

● | Collecting blood from a healthy donor;
--+---------------------------------------


● | Processing the donor’s blood to remove the stem cells before returning the rest of the donor’s blood back to the donor;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pre-conditioning the patient with high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Infusing the donor’s stem cells into the patient to allow for the production of new blood cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Although a potentially life-saving treatment for patients suffering from hematological cancers, between 40-60% of patients receiving HSCT treatments experience acute or chronic GvHD, which together carries a 50% mortality rate. After being transplanted into the patient, donor-derived T cells are responsible for mediating the beneficial graft versus leukemia (“GvL”) effect. In many cases, however, donor-derived T cells that remain within the graft itself have also been linked to destruction of healthy tissue in the patient (the host), with particular risk of destroying cells in the patient’s skin, gut, and liver, resulting in aGvHD. Although depleting donor grafts of T cells can prevent or reduce the risk of aGvHD, this results in a reduced GvL effect, thereby having a detrimental impact on the efficacy of the allogeneic HSCT treatment itself and leading to increased relapse rates.



Despite new therapies, there remains a significant unmet medical need for an agent that can uncouple the beneficial GvL effect from harmful aGvHD. In December 2022, the FDA approved Orencia (abatacept) from Bristol Myers Squibb for the prevention of aGvHD and in 2019 Jakafi (ruxolitinib) from Incyte Corporation was approved for steroid-refractory aGvHD. Other treatments include pre-conditioning regimens for HSCT treatments that can vary significantly by treatment centers, including by unapproved, or “off-label,” use of agents that have been approved by FDA for other uses only.



We believe that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has the potential to prevent or treat GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer. The technology was featured in a November 2018 research article published in Science Translational Medicine, where the authors demonstrated in a murine model of GvHD, that donor T cell-derived GM-CSF drives GvHD through activation, expansion, and trafficking of myeloid cells but has no effect on the GvL response. Neutralization of GM-CSF (either using a neutralizing antibody or through GM-CSF gene knock-out) was able to uncouple the myeloid-mediated immunopathology resulting in GvHD from the T cell-mediated control of leukemic cells. This discovery provides a mechanistic proof-of-concept for neutralizing GM-CSF to prevent GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Corroborating data related to the critical effect GM-CSF has on GvHD development in HSCT was published in blood advances in October 2019 by Gartlan et al.



Our Development Program



We believe that GM-CSF neutralization using lenzilumab has the potential to make allogeneic HSCT safer and more effective. Similar to GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage with CAR-T therapy, GM-CSF neutralization has demonstrated potential to attenuate acute GvHD while maintaining the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. We believe lenzilumab has potential to prevent or reduce aGvHD in allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer as a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers.



We are currently evaluating lenzilumab for the early treatment of aGvHD in patients undergoing bone marrow transplants in a Phase 2/3 potentially registrational trial, known as the “RATinG” study. The study is being conducted by the IMPACT Partnership, a collection of 22 stem cell transplant centers located in the United Kingdom. We anticipate the first patient dosing in this study to occur in the second quarter of 2023  . We are providing lenzilumab for the study including the cost of import, labeling and distribution of the study drug, and support for certain laboratory tests related to the study, but the majority of the study costs will be borne by the IMPACT Partnership. The goal of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab in reducing non-relapse mortality at six months.



Our Commercial Opportunity



The overall number of allogeneic HSCT treatments continues to increase annually in the US and abroad. According to the Center for International Blood & Bone Marrow Transplant Research (“CIBMTR”), in 2019, approximately 10,000 allogeneic HSCT treatments were expected to be performed in the US, with similar trends expected in Europe (Phelan, et al Current use and outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: CIBMTR US summary slides 2020). The cost of managing these patients in the first year is estimated at approximately $400,000.

Lenzilumab in CAR-T



Scientific Rationale



FDA-approved CAR-T therapies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using targeted immuno-cellular engineering to cause a patient’s own T-cells to fight certain cancers that have not responded to standard therapies. T-cells are often called the “workhorses” of the immune system because of their role in coordinating the immune response and killing cells infected by pathogens and cancer cells. As depicted below, each of the FDA-approved CAR-T therapies are currently a one-time treatment that involves multiple steps:

● | Harvesting white blood cells from the patient’s blood, also known as apheresis;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Engineering T-cells within this population to express cancer-specific receptors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing and purifying the number of genetically re-engineered T-cells; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Infusing the functional cancer-specific T-cells back into the patient to allow for expansion and targeting the cancer cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




As of the date of this filing, six CAR-T therapies have been approved by FDA: Gilead/Kite’s Yescarta, and Tecartus, Novartis’s Kymriah, Johnson & Johnson’s Carvykti, Bristol Myers Squibb’s Breyanzi and Abecma, which seek to treat forms of B-cell and plasma cell cancers such as various types of NHL, including DLBCL, Follicular Lymphoma (“FL”) Mantle Cell Lymphoma (“MCL”), adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”), and multiple myeloma. Although patients suffering from these aggressive cancers frequently undergo multiple treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapy including stem cell transplants, the five-year survival rate has been severely limited and patients who do not respond to, or have relapsed following at least two courses of standard treatment, have no other treatment options and a very poor outcome. According to multiple sources, specifically US governmental sources, including the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (“SEER”) program of the National Cancer Institute, which is one source of epidemiologic information on the incidence and survival rates of cancer in the US, we estimate the US incidence of DLBCL to be approximately 24,000 patients annually, FL to be approximately 16,000 patients annually, ALL to be approximately 7,000 patients annually and MCL to be approximately 4,000 patients annually.



The FDA-approved CAR-T therapies have significant limitations. Despite the exciting prospects for treating patients with limited options, significant and potentially life-threatening side-effects are associated with CAR-T therapy, including Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity (“ICANS”) and CRS. While there may be individual differences between CAR-T therapy products, the overall toxicity profile is generally consistent with that reported for Yescarta and Tecartus, and it is known that various development-stage BCMA and other CAR-T therapies are hampered by the emergence of ICANS, CRS and other serious and potentially fatal side-effects. In addition, durable efficacy is an area that could be improved upon.



Both ICANS and CRS are caused by a large-scale release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by the CAR-T therapy and remain significant unmet needs. Because ICANS and CRS can be life-threatening and have proven fatal in many instances, and because each product bears a “Boxed Warning” from FDA (the strictest FDA warning label intended to alert patients and providers about serious and life-threatening risks associated with a particular drug), patients seeking to benefit from CAR-T therapy, generally may only do so if the treatment center is in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) program required by FDA.



REMS is a drug safety program that FDA requires certain medications with serious safety concerns to adhere to strict on-going monitoring and reporting and is intended to assist and train certified treatment centers on the management of these serious side-effects. We believe the REMS requirement may have adversely impacted both market uptake and usage to date.



According to the original package inserts for Yescarta and Tecartus, 81% (NHL), 81% (MCL), 87% (ALL) of patients treated in the clinical trial setting experienced ICANS (with up to 35% of cases being severe, or grade >3). The package insert for Yescarta was later updated to include the use of prophylactic corticosteroids across all approved indications. The update was based on the safety update from Cohort 6 of the ZUMA-1 study which showed that in 39 patients, prophylactic or early use of corticosteroids resulted in neurological events (Grade ≥3) in 13% of patients and 0% of the patients had CRS (Grade ≥3). These original rates may be more prevalent in practice. Moreover, based on feedback from leading treatment centers in the US, approximately 30% to 40% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy require admission to the ICU and in some cases require an extended stay, with multiple interventions, including ventilator support and other supportive measures, to be urgently administered to manage these side-effects. Some patients can suffer seizures, coma, brain swelling, heart arrhythmias, organ failure and serious and life-threatening clotting disorders, not only causing more complex and potentially fatal medical consequences, but significantly adding to the cost of patient care. These can be particularly challenging and concerning issues, especially in younger patients.



Our Development Program



We believe lenzilumab has the potential to improve the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapy and that the use of lenzilumab may minimize or eradicate the incidence, frequency, duration and/or severity of ICANS and/or CRS that frequently appear in CAR-T patients. In addition, lenzilumab may lead to an improvement in durable efficacy.

10
--





Accordingly, we have identified lenzilumab as a potential companion treatment alongside certain CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapies. GM-CSF neutralization may enhance CAR-T proliferation and effector functions and potentially confer additional benefits in terms of durable efficacy and healthcare resource utilization. Preclinical data generated in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, which was published in blood, a premier journal in hematology, indicates that the use of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy may also enhance the proliferation and improve the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This may also result in durable, or longer term, responses in CAR-T therapies.



Lenzilumab has been studied in a multi-center Phase 1b trial as a sequenced therapy with Yescarta to prevent CRS and ICANS in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) (NCT04314843), for which we announced positive results in April 2021. Pursuant to our strategic realignment plan, the previously planned Company-sponsored study of lenzilumab with certain CAR-T therapies, known as SHIELD, has been terminated. A leading network of centers, The Mayo Clinics, is currently progressing with an IIT of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapies.



Our Commercial Opportunity



Revenues from the sales of approved CAR-T therapies were valued at approximately $2.19 billion in 2022. We estimate globally over 15,000 patients have been treated with CAR-T therapies. Analysts predict that Yescarta only will reach peak sales in excess of $1.5 billion as additional patients become eligible for treatment. We believe lenzilumab has the ability to transform CAR-T therapy and potentially a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic cell transplantation. There is a direct correlation between the efficacy of CAR-T therapy and the incidence of life-threatening toxicities, including ICANS and CRS.



We believe that our GM-CSF pathway science, assets and expertise create two technology platforms to assist in the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies:




● | Lenzilumab has the potential to be used in combination with any FDA-approved or development stage T-cell therapy, including CAR-T therapy, as well as in combination with other cell therapies such as allogeneic HSCT such as bone marrow transplants, to make these treatments safer and more effective.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition, our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that may inherently avoid any efficacy/toxicity linkage, thereby potentially preserving the benefits of the CAR-T therapy while reducing or altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ifabotuzumab



Ifabotuzumab is a Humaneered monoclonal antibody, formerly referred to as KB004, which targets the EphA3 receptor, and in which the antibody carbohydrate chains lack fucose, thereby enhancing the targeted cell-killing activity of the antibody. We believe that ifabotuzumab as part of an antibody drug conjugate has the potential for treating solid tumors. In 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research (“LICR”) pursuant to which LICR granted certain exclusive rights to the ifabotuzumab prototype (referred to as IIIA4) as well as EphA3 intellectual property.



Ifabotuzumab binds to EphA3, which plays an important role in cell positioning and tissue organization during fetal development but is not thought to be expressed nor play a significant role in healthy adults. EphA3 is a tyrosine kinase receptor, aberrantly expressed on the tumor vasculature and tumor stroma in several solid tumors including melanoma, breast cancer, small and non-small cell lung cancer (“SCLC” and “NSCLC”), colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, renal cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”), and prostate cancer, making it an attractive target for a range of cancers. Publications related to certain cancers have indicated that EphA3 tumor cell expression correlates with cancer growth and a poor prognosis. EphA3 appears to be critically involved in maintaining tumor cells in a less differentiated state by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. EphA3 knockdown or depletion of EphA3-positive tumor cells may reduce tumorigenic potential to a degree comparable to treatment with a therapeutic radiolabeled EphA3-specific monoclonal antibody. We believe EphA3 is a functional, targetable receptor in solid tumors. A study published in December 2018 in ‘Cancers’ showed that an antibody drug conjugate (“ADC”) comprising IIIA4 (a predecessor monoclonal antibody and prototype for ifabotuzumab) showed significant survival benefit in mice with GBM.



Anti-EphA3 treatment has shown encouraging preclinical results in multiple experiment types, including patient primary tumor cell assays, colony forming assays, and xenograft mouse models. Upon binding to EphA3, ifabotuzumab causes cell killing to occur either through antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity or through direct apoptosis, and in the case of tumor neovasculature, through cell rounding and blood vessel disruption. Given the expression pattern of EphA3 in multiple tumor types, ifabotuzumab may have the potential to kill cancer cells and the tumor stem cell microenvironment, providing for long-term responses while sparing normal cells.



On April 10, 2021, we presented top-line results from the Phase 1 safety and bioimaging trial of ifabotuzumab in patients with GBM at the American Association for Cancer Research 2021 Annual Meeting. The Phase 1 study primarily sought to determine the safety and recommended Phase 2 dose of ifabotuzumab in patients with GBM, the most frequent and lethal primary brain neoplasm, with 5-year survival rates of 10%. There were no dose-limiting toxicities observed and all adverse events were readily manageable. Additional studies are being planned to evaluate ifabotuzumab as an ADC in patients with solid tumors, such as, colon, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. These studies include the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute which plans to conduct a Phase 1b dose-escalation and imaging study in non-CNS solid tumors that is scheduled to begin in 2023.

HGEN005



HGEN005 is a Humaneered monoclonal antibody, formerly referred to as KB005, which selectively targets the eosinophil receptor EMR1. HGEN005 is being explored as a potential treatment for a range of eosinophilic diseases including eosinophilic leukemia both as an optimized naked antibody and as the backbone for a novel CAR-T construct.



A major limitation of current eosinophil-targeted therapies is incomplete depletion of tissue eosinophils and/or lack of cell selectivity. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. If too many eosinophils are produced in the body, chronic inflammation and tissue and organ damage may result. The origin and development of eosinophilic disorders is mostly due to eosinophils infiltrating tissue. EMR1 is expressed exclusively on eosinophils, making it an ideal target for the treatment of eosinophilic disorders. Regardless of the eosinophilic disorder, mature eosinophils express EMR1 in tissue, blood and bone marrow in patients with eosinophilia. We believe that because of its high selectivity, HGEN005 has significant potential to treat serious eosinophil diseases.



In preclinical work, HGEN005’s anti-EMR1 activity resulted in dramatically enhanced Natural Killer (“NK”) of eosinophils from normal and eosinophilic donors and also induced a rapid and sustained depletion of eosinophils in a non-human primate model without any clinically significant adverse events. The development of HGEN005 is on hold while we focus on lenzilumab and ifabotuzumab.



Intellectual Property



Intellectual property is an important part of our strategy and has been a key focus area for Humanigen. We have and continue to file aggressively on our own inventions and in-license intellectual property and technology as it relates to our therapeutic interests. We believe that we are a leader in the field of GM-CSF neutralization in particular, and in targeting EphA3.

On July 24, 2020, we entered into a clinical trial agreement (the “Clinical Trial Agreement”) with NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health, which is part of the United States Government Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Agreement, lenzilumab was evaluated in the NIAID-sponsored ACTIV-5/ BET in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The ACTIV-5/BET-B study protocol was modified to include baseline CRP below 150 mg/L (the CRP subgroup) as the primary analysis population. The topline results showed the trial did not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint, although the topline results did indicate that lenzilumab demonstrated a positive trend in mortality. Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Agreement, NIAID served as sponsor and was responsible for supervising and overseeing ACTIV-5/BET-B. We provided lenzilumab to NIAID without charge and in quantities to ensure a sufficient supply of lenzilumab.

 The Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research



In 2004, we entered into a license agreement with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (“LICR”) pursuant to which LICR granted to us an exclusive license for intellectual property rights and materials related to chimeric anti-GM-CSF antibodies that formed the basis for lenzilumab. Under the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license to develop antibodies related to LICR’s antibodies against GM-CSF. We are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and sell lenzilumab. We pay LICR a quarterly license fee and are obligated to pay to LICR a royalty from 1.5% to 3% of net sales of licensed products, subject to certain potential offsets and deductions. Our royalty obligation applies on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, and will begin on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a given country and end on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent covering a licensed product in a given country (which in the US is currently expected in 2029 for the composition of matter and 2038 for methods of use in CAR-T) or 10 years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in the country. We must also pay to LICR a certain percentage of sublicensing revenue received by us. Payments made to LICR under this license for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.1 million.
Other License Agreements



LICR and ifabotuzumab



In 2006, we entered into a license agreement with LICR pursuant to which LICR granted to us certain exclusive rights to the ifabotuzumab prototype (IIIA4) which targets EphA3 and EphA3-related intellectual property. Under the agreement, we obtained rights to develop and commercialize products made through use of licensed patents and any improvements thereto, including human or Humaneered antibodies that bind to or modulate EphA3. We paid LICR an upfront option fee of $0.05 million and a further $0.05 million upon our exercise of the option for the exclusive license outlined above. We are responsible for contingent milestone payments of less than $2.5 million and royalties of 3% of net sales subject to certain potential offsets and deductions. In addition, we are obligated to pay to LICR a percentage of certain payments we receive from any sublicensee in consideration for a sublicense. Our royalty obligation exists on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, which will begin on the first commercial sale and end on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent covering such licensed product in such country, which in the US is currently expected in 2031, or 10 years from first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country.



BioWa and Lonza



In 2010, we entered into a license agreement with BioWa, Inc. (“BioWa”), and Lonza Sales AG (“Lonza”) pursuant to which BioWa and Lonza granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain know-how and patents related to antibody expression and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity enhancing technology using BioWa and Lonza’s Potelligent® CHOK1SV technology. This technology is used to enhance the cell killing capabilities of antibodies and is currently used by us in connection with our development of ifabotuzumab. Under this agreement, we owe annual license fees, milestone payments in connection with certain regulatory and sales milestones and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products developed under the agreement. The agreement expires upon the expiration of royalty payment obligations under the agreement, is terminable at will by us upon written notice, is terminable by BioWa and Lonza if we challenge or otherwise oppose any licensed patents under the agreement and is terminable by either party upon the occurrence of an uncured material breach or insolvency.



Patents and Trade Secrets



We use a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protections to protect our product candidates and platforms. We will be able to protect our product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or to the extent our technology is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Intellectual property is an important part of our strategy. We have and continue to file aggressively on our own inventions and in-licensed intellectual property and technology as it relates to our therapeutic interests. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patent rights for and to extend the life of patents covering lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab, HGEN005, our Humaneered technology, and our GM-CSF gene-editing CAR-T platform technologies, to preserve trade secrets and proprietary know how, and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We actively seek patent protection, if available, in the US and select foreign countries for the technology we develop. We have 140 registered patents, including 16 registered in the US and 124 registered in foreign countries. Of the 140 registered patents, 101 are owned by us, 29 are owned jointly with a third party and 10 are exclusively licensed from a third party. We also have 86 patent applications pending globally, of which 46 are owned by us, 13 are owned jointly with a third party and 27 are exclusively licensed from a third party.

Using our Humaneered technology, we have developed and own two composition of matter US patents covering lenzilumab and related anti-GM-CSF antibodies that provide patent protection through April 2029, a granted composition of matter patent in 15 European countries and certain foreign countries, and have four US patents, one foreign patent, and 14 additional pending patent applications in the US, 55 foreign patent applications, and three PCT international patent application covering various methods of treatment, including in the CAR-T space covering a broad and comprehensive range of approaches to neutralizing GM-CSF, including the use of GM-CSF k/o CAR-T cells, which, if granted, are expected to confer protection to at least September 2039.



We developed and own an issued US composition of matter patent covering ifabotuzumab and related anti-EphA3 antibodies, which is currently expected to expire in 2031, and own 22 foreign patents to anti-EphA3 antibodies and therapeutic uses, in addition to owning three US patents and jointly owning one US patent to therapeutic methods using anti-EphA3 antibodies, two European patents validated in 22 countries, and five foreign patents owned jointly with a third party covering methods of treatment with anti-EphA3 antibodies. The one US and 40 foreign patents to our Humaneered technology cover methods of producing human antibodies that are very specific for target antigens using only a small region from mouse antibodies.



Manufacturing and Raw Materials



We outsource all development activities, including the development of formulation prototypes. We do not have, nor do we plan to have, any manufacturing facilities. Instead, we have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the manufacture of bulk drug substance (“BDS”) and fill, finish, labeling, packaging and distribution work for our product candidates. We believe our outsourcing approach allows us to maintain a leaner staff and a more flexible infrastructure, allowing us to focus our expertise on developing our products.



In 2020 and the first half of 2021, we were aggressive in pursuing manufacturing slots for lenzilumab in contemplation of its potential commercialization under an EUA in the US or an equivalent authorization in the UK and EU. Please refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for a further discussion of the costs we incurred in these efforts. Our production efforts were less successful than we had anticipated, as we experienced shortages of raw materials and critical components necessary for our manufacturing processes, delays in production and availability of manufacturing slots and failures in production at the BDS and DP level resulting in lower than anticipated yields. Further, certain of our CMOs had difficulties in producing BDS within specifications or were unable to produce BDS on a timely basis due to challenges in the supply of materials used in the production process. We have amended, and in some cases canceled, certain of these CMO agreements. More recently, we have settled our disputes with two of our CMOs. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on these settlement agreements.



In connection with our realignment to deemphasize the deployment of certain resources for the development of lenzilumab for COVID-19, with the exception of one lenzilumab batch in process, we have discontinued the manufacturing of lenzilumab and are consolidating the remaining inventory of lenzilumab bulk drug substance and drug product in a central location for potential future use. We believe we have sufficient drug product for our currently planned clinical trials.



Sales and Marketing



We intend to outsource our sales and marketing infrastructure necessary to market and sell our products, if authorized or approved. As our drug candidates progress, we may also seek strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties including those with existing infrastructure and with government bodies.
Competition



We compete in an industry characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, a changing regulatory and legislative landscape and a strong emphasis on the benefits of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivities. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, other biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. We compete with these parties to develop a potential treatment for hematologic cancers, and to develop potential biologic therapies to make allogeneic HSCT and CAR-T therapy safer and more effective, in addition to recruiting highly qualified personnel. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with established therapies, with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors, including competitors relying to a large extent on our drug approvals or on our biologics approvals, or with generic copies of our product approved by FDA, as bio-similars, referencing our drug products. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing, sales and human resources capabilities than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.



Competition for the treatment of solid tumors varies by tumor type. Surgery and/or radiation treatment is typically the first-line therapy, followed by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used as front-line treatment in the case of inoperable tumors and targeted therapies may be used as second-line therapy for specific solid tumors that exhibit certain mutations. There are currently no known therapies that target EpAh3 antigen.

Lenzilumab and CMML competition



CMML is currently treated via stem cell transplant, surgery or chemotherapy, typically azacytidine or decitabine. According to clinicaltrials.gov, there are a limited number of studies exclusively studying CMML. Most studies that include CMML also include other oncological conditions. Two Phase 2 open-label studies are focused exclusively on CMML, exploring the use of cobimetinib (Genentech, Inc.) and ruxolitinib (Incyte Corporation) with each study enrolling 29 patients.



Lenzilumab and aGvHD competition



The current standard of care for aGvHD is systemic steroids and for steroid refractory disease, ruxolitinib. Abatacept is approved for prevention of aGvHD in combination with MTX and CNI.



Lenzilumab and CAR-T-related toxicities competition



Medicines used to manage ICANS and CRS, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, have not adequately controlled the side-effects, and steroids may have a detrimental impact on the efficacy of the CAR-T therapy itself while tocilizumab may increase the risk of CAR-T therapy induced ICANS and is correlated with an increased risk of infections, including severe infections. Further, these medicines have not undergone prospective clinical trials for use in this patient population. Tocilizumab is not approved for prevention of CRS, nor is it approved for either prevention or treatment of ICANS.

 

Government Regulation 



Drug Development and Approval in the US



As a biopharmaceutical company operating in the US, we are subject to extensive regulation by FDA and by other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. FDA regulates biological products such as our product candidates under the US Federal Food and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. These laws and regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for preclinical and clinical testing, development, approval, labeling, manufacture, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products and product candidates. Under the PHSA, in most circumstances an FDA-approved BLA is required to market a biological product, or biologic, in the US Biologics receive 12 years market exclusivity from first licensure. 
Emergency Use Authorization



FDA’s EUA authority allows the agency to facilitate greater availability and use of medical countermeasures, including biologics, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has declared that circumstances exist that justify such authorization. Under such circumstances, companies may request an EUA to permit the marketing and use of a product before that product has received FDA approval, or to permit the otherwise unapproved use of an approved product. FDA may only issue an EUA if it concludes that: the chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent referred to in the HHS Secretary’s public health emergency declaration is capable of causing a serious or life-threatening disease; the product at issue “may be effective” to prevent, diagnose, or treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions that can be caused by that agent or to mitigate a disease or condition caused by an FDA-regulated product used to diagnose, treat, or prevent a disease or condition caused by that agent; and that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The EUA “may be effective” standard requires a lower level of evidence than the “effectiveness” standard required for a BLA.



An EUA is not a permanent marketing authorization. Rather, an EUA may be terminated once the Secretary of HHS declares that the public health emergency is terminated; when a product that is marketed under an EUA obtains full marketing approval (for example, under a BLA); or when circumstances change (such as, for example, new data emerge that change the risk-benefit calculation). As a practical matter, where the HHS Secretary declares an end to the public health emergency that gave rise to FDA’s EUA authority, the Secretary must provide advance notice that allows for disposition of an unapproved product. As of late January 2022, the Biden Administration has indicated it intends to let the coronavirus public health emergency expire in May 2023. If and when this public health emergency is terminated, the EUA landscape will change. Products currently marketed under a COVID-related EUA will eventually lose their marketing eligibility, although HHS will provide advance notice and is likely to allow time for the disposition of unapproved products and/or their transition to a different status.

Applications Relying on the Applicant’s Clinical Data



The approval process for a BLA under the PHSA requires the conduct of extensive studies and the submission of large amounts of data by the applicant. The biologic development process for these applications will generally include the following phases:
Preclinical Testing. Before testing any new biologic in human subjects in the US, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations and the US Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.



IND Application. Human clinical trials in the US cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to FDA as part of the IND application, and FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the product in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless FDA raises concerns, the IND application becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.



Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials. GCP requirements are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected.



Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is submitted to FDA as part of the IND application. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), at the institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the US. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND application may be submitted in support of a BLA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and FDA is able to validate the data. A study sponsor is required to publicly post certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results on the government website clinicaltrials.gov.



Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another and, notably, in the CAR-T setting, FDA has granted approval to all six currently marketed CAR-T therapies (Gilead/Kite’s Yescarta, and Tecartus, Novartis’ Kymriah, Johnson & Johnson’s Carvykti, and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Breyanzi and Abecma) based on Phase 2 data and to tocilizumab without any prospective data in the CAR-T setting:




∙ | Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational product to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase I clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the product, the side-effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∙ | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∙ | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the product’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen, or with the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


∙ | FDA does not always require every approved therapy to complete Phase 1 through 3 studies to secure approval. Approval through expedited routes is at the discretion of FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The sponsoring company, FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval.



BLA Submission and Review



After completing clinical testing of an investigational biologic product, a sponsor must prepare and submit a BLA for review and approval by FDA. A BLA is a comprehensive, multi-volume application that must include, among other things, sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling. When a BLA is submitted, FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, FDA may refuse to accept the application for filing and may request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information and review of the application is delayed.





16
--





FDA performance goals, which are target dates and other aspirational measures of agency performance to which the agency, Congressional representatives, and industry agree through negotiations that occur every five years, generally provide for action on BLA applications within 10 months of submission or 10 months from acceptance for filing for an original BLA. FDA is not expected to meet those target dates for all applications, however, and the deadline may be extended in certain circumstances, such as when the applicant submits new data late in the review period. In practice, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. In some circumstances, FDA can expedite the review of new biologics deemed to qualify for priority review, such as those intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. In those cases, the targeted action date is six months from submission, or for biologics constituting original biological products, six months from the date that FDA accepts the application for filing.



As part of its review, FDA may refer a BLA to an advisory committee for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Although FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations. FDA may also determine that a REMS program is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and that the product can therefore be approved. A REMS program may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the product, depending on what FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the product. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug or biological product in relevant pediatric populations, unless the requirement is waived or deferred. Receiving orphan drug designation from FDA is one situation where such a requirement may be waived.



After review of a BLA, FDA may determine that the product cannot be approved, or may determine that it can only be approved if the applicant cures deficiencies in the application, in which case the agency endeavors to provide the applicant with a complete list of the deficiencies in correspondence known as a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). A CRL may request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, FDA may decide that the BLA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets them. Additionally, as a condition of approval, FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as “Phase IV” studies or “post-marketing requirements.” Obtaining regulatory approval often takes several years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.



Post-approval modifications to the drug or biologic product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials. The proposed changes would need to be submitted in a new or supplemental BLA, which would then require FDA approval.



Regulatory Exclusivities



Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act



In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”) was enacted, creating an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, reference biological products licensed under a BLA. The BPCIA also provides innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products 12 years of exclusive use from first licensure before biosimilar versions can be licensed in the US. This means that FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar version of a reference biological product until 12 years after the date of first licensure of the reference biological product (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results reported to FDA), although a biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date of first licensure of the reference biological product. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant must provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval of the biosimilar product, although the interpretation of those procedures has been subject to litigation and appears to continue to evolve. The BPCIA also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to be determined by FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product.



FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA in 2015, and the agency continues to refine the procedures and standards it will apply in implementing this approval pathway. FDA has released guidance documents interpreting specific aspects of the BPCIA in the years since. We would expect lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005, as biologics, to each receive at least 12 years exclusivity from first licensure if they are approved.

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity



Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA must contain data adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, FDA, and FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.



For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-Phase I meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.



FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after licensing of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”). Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.



The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits a BLA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the BLA if the biologic is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary potency to inform pediatric labeling for the product. Deferrals and waivers as described above are also available.



Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the US and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by a further six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which FDA cannot license another application.



Orphan Drug Designation



The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of therapeutic products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Rare diseases and conditions generally are those affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the US, but also include diseases or conditions affecting more than 200,000 individuals in the US if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the US a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the US of such product.



If a sponsor demonstrates that a therapeutic product, including a biological product, is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, and meets certain other criteria, FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. FDA may grant multiple orphan designations to different companies developing the same product for the same indication, until the one company is the first to be able to secure successful approval for that product. The first product approved with an orphan drug designated indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity from the date of approval for that indication. During that period, FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. FDA can also revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet patient needs.



A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation is also granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, FDA will typically coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval based on more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population.

Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions



FDA has implemented a number of expedited programs to help ensure that therapies for serious or life-threatening conditions, and for which there is unmet medical need, are approved and available to patients as soon as it can be concluded that the therapies’ benefits justify their risks. Among these programs are the following:
Fast Track Designation



FDA may designate a product for fast-track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where non-clinical or clinical data demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical need for such a disease or condition. A product can also receive fast track review if it receives breakthrough therapy designation.



For fast-track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with FDA and FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast-track product’s application before the application is complete, also referred to as a ‘rolling review’. This rolling review may be available if FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast-track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. Furthermore, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast-track application does not begin until the last section of the complete application is submitted. Finally, the fast-track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.



Breakthrough Therapy Designation



A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of fast-track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design efficient clinical trials.
Accelerated Approval



Under the accelerated approval pathway, FDA may approve a drug or biologic based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit; qualifying products must target a serious or life-threatening illness and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
Priority Review



FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. FDA generally determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and will shorten FDA’s goal for acting on a marketing application from the standard targeted ten months to a target of six months review.



Created in 2012 under the FDASIA and extended with the 21st Century Cures Act in 2016, FDA is authorized under section 529 of the FDCA to grant a PRV to BLA sponsors receiving FDA approval for a product to treat a rare pediatric disease, defined as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, and where more than 50% of the patients affected are aged from birth to 18 years. We believe that our product candidates which may assist with the treatment of rare pediatric cancers or other rare pediatric diseases may qualify for a PRV under this program, depending on the indication.

The PRV program allows the voucher holder to obtain priority review for a product application that would otherwise not receive priority review, shortening FDA’s target review period to a targeted six months following acceptance of filing of an NDA or BLA, or four months shorter than the standard review period. The voucher may be used by the sponsor who receives it, or it may be sold to another sponsor for use in that sponsor’s own marketing application. The sponsor who uses the voucher is required to pay additional user fees on top of the standard user fee for reviewing an NDA or BLA.



We anticipate submitting applications for one or more of these expedited programs and the targeted therapeutic indications.



Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation



Recently, through the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), Congress also established another expedited program, called a RMAT designation. The Cures Act directs FDA to facilitate an efficient development program for and expedite review of RMATs. To qualify for this program, the product must be a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or a combination of such products, and not a product solely regulated as a human cell and tissue product. The product must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the product has the potential to address an unmet need for such disease or condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval.



Post-Licensing Regulation



Once a BLA is approved and a product marketed, a sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-licensing regulatory requirements as well as any post-licensing requirements that FDA may have imposed as part of the licensing process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to FDA, provide updated safety and potency or efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing processes are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.



In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCA”), which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.



Drug Development and Approval in Australia, the European Union and United Kingdom



In order to market a drug product outside of the United States, a company must comply with a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical studies, product approval, and commercial sale and distribution of the product. Regardless of whether a company obtains FDA approval for the product, it must obtain any necessary approvals from foreign regulatory authorities prior to commencing clinical trials or marketing the product in the relevant countries. The approval process and regulatory requirements vary significantly across jurisdictions, and the time to approval and marketing may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
European Union 



The process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. As in the United States, the EU also has a standard marketing authorization approval process and a conditional authorization process that can be used to bring medicine to the market more quickly during a public health emergency.



As in the US, companies may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe receive economic and marketing benefits, including up to 11 years of exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.

In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) with EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a deferral or waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity.



European Union – Conditional Marketing Authorization



The EMA may grant a conditional marketing authorization for medicines that address unmet needs, on the basis of less comprehensive clinical data than normally required, where the benefit of immediate availability of the medicine outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Drugs for human use, including orphan drugs, are eligible for conditional marketing authorization if they are intended to treat, prevent, or diagnose serious debilitating or life-threatening diseases, if: (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive; (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical study data; (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled; and (4) the benefit to the public health of the immediate availability on the market of the product outweighs the risk inherent in the need for additional data. Conditional marketing authorization, which may specify additional requirements regarding completion of ongoing or new studies and collection of pharmacovigilance data, is valid for one year, and may be renewed annually if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions. 
The United Kingdom



Since the exit of the UK from the European Union, Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) is no longer covered by EU procedures for the grant of marketing authorizations and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market drugs (Northern Ireland is covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). It will be necessary for applicants to make a separate application to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") for a UK marketing authorization.



MHRA has introduced a national conditional marketing authorization scheme for new drugs in Great Britain. This scheme has the same eligibility criteria as the EU scheme and is intended for drugs that fulfill an unmet medical need, such as drugs for serious and life-threatening diseases where no satisfactory treatment methods are available or where the product offers a major therapeutic advantage.



Gaining orphan drug designation in Great Britain following Brexit is based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain (rather than in the EU). It is, therefore, possible that conditions that are currently designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain will no longer be and that conditions that are not currently designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in Great Britain. Unlike in the EU, applications for orphan drug designation in Great Britain are reviewed in parallel with the corresponding marketing authorization application.



Australia



The Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) governs the review and approval of medicinal products for human use in Australia, and the processes and requirements for such. Generally, the requirements are similar to those in the US, UK and Europe. There are three regulatory product approval pathways; standard, priority, and provisional. The priority review pathway offers an expedited review potential for products that treat, prevent or diagnose a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition. The goal for priority review is to decrease overall time to approval by 3 months. Both standard and priority review pathways require full and complete electronic Common Technical Document (“eCTD”) submissions. The provisional approval pathway allows for submission of preliminary or limited clinical data in cases whereby data demonstrates the medicine is likely to provide a significant improvement in efficacy or safety for a serious condition, and there is a substantiated plan to provide more comprehensive data within at least 6 years. TGA also offers Orphan Drug Designations which are associated with certain financial incentives for serious conditions in limited populations.
Employees and Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2022, we employed six full-time employees, and no part-time employees, the majority of whom work remotely in various locations throughout the United States and the world. In addition, we contract with several part-time independent consultants performing manufacturing, supply chain, quality assurance and control, regulatory and clinical development, intellectual property, public relations, and finance and accounting functions. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
