ITEM 1. Business.



Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Item 1 to “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Verde Clean Fuels refer to Intermediate and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing and Verde Clean Fuels and its subsidiaries following the Closing.



Overview



During the year ended December 31, 2022 and prior to the Business Combination, CENAQ was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. For more information on the Business Combination, see the section entitled “Explanatory Note” elsewhere in this Report.



Following the Business Combination, Verde Clean Fuels is a renewable energy company specializing in the conversion of synthesis gas, or syngas, derived from diverse feedstocks, such as biomass, municipal solid waste (“MSW”) and mixed plastics, as well as natural gas (including synthetic natural gas) and other feedstocks, into liquid hydrocarbons that can be used as gasoline through an innovative and proprietary liquid fuels technology, the STG+® process. Through our STG+® process, we convert syngas into Reformulated Blend-stock for Oxygenate Blending (“RBOB”) gasoline. We are focused on the development of technology and commercial facilities aimed at turning waste and other bio-feedstocks into a usable stream of syngas which is then transformed into a single finished fuel, such as gasoline, without any additional refining steps. The availability of biogenic MSW and the economic and environmental drivers that divert these materials from landfills will enable us to utilize these waste streams to produce renewable gasoline from modular production facilities with expected capacity to produce between approximately seven million to 30 million gallons of renewable gasoline per year.



We are redefining liquid fuels technology through our proprietary and innovative STG+® process to deliver scalable and cost-effective renewable gasoline. We acquired our STG+® technology from Primus Green Energy (“Primus”), a company established in 2007 that developed the patented STG+® technology to convert syngas into gasoline or methanol. Since acquiring the technology, we have adapted the application of our STG+® technology to focus on the renewable energy industry. This adaptation requires a third-party gasification system to produce acceptable synthesis gas from these renewable feedstocks. Our proprietary STG+® system converts the syngas into gasoline.



We have made significant progress towards commercializing the first STG+® based commercial production facility in the United States. Our first commercial production facility, which we expect to be operational by the first half of 2025, will be in Maricopa, Arizona. In the first phase we expect this facility to produce approximately 7 million gallons of renewable gasoline in the first full year of operations. In the second phase, which we expect to be operational in 2026, we anticipate producing approximately 30 million gallons per year of renewable gasoline. Additionally, we have several additional renewable gasoline projects, and flare mitigating natural gas to gasoline project, in various early stages of development.



Over $110 million has been invested in our technology, including our demonstration facility in New Jersey, which has completed over 10,500 hours of operation producing gasoline or methanol. Our demonstration facility represents the scalable nature of our operational modular commercial design which has fully integrated reactors and recycle lines and is designed with key variables, like gas velocity and catalyst bed length, at a 1-to-1 scale with our commercial design. We have also participated in carbon lifecycle studies to validate the CI score and reduced lifecycle emissions of our renewable gasoline as well as fuel, blending and engine testing to validate the specification and performance of our gasoline product. We believe our renewable gasoline exhibits a significant lifecycle carbon emissions reduction compared to traditional petroleum-based gasoline. As a result, we believe our gasoline produced from renewable feedstock, such as biomass, will qualify under the federal renewable fuel standard (“RFS”) program for the D3 renewable identification number (“RIN”) (a carbon credit), which can have significant value. Similarly, gasoline produced from our process may also qualify for various state carbon programs, including California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”). Unlike many other gas-to-liquids technologies, not only can our STG+® process produce renewable gasoline from syngas, but we expect it will be able to be applied at other production facilities to produce other end products including methanol. In addition to our initial focus on the production of renewable gasoline, there is opportunity to continue to develop additional process technology to produce middle distillates including sustainable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not derived revenue from its principal business activities. The Company is managed as an integrated business and consequently, there is only one reportable segment. However, as with other government programs, the use requirements of the RFS program and other similar state-level programs are subject to change, which could materially harm our ability to operate profitably.

Our Growth Strategy



We intend to grow our business by leveraging our competitive advantages in the design and implementation of small-scale modular facilities that can be situated in proximity to renewable feedstock sources. We believe we have a number of avenues to achieve our growth objectives:
Construction and Development of Commercial Production Facilities



A critical step in our success will be the successful construction and operation of the first commercial production facility using our STG+® technology. In April 2022, we commenced a pre-FEED study for our first commercial production facility in Maricopa, Arizona, and we are actively engaged in activities associated with securing the location, feedstock, utility interconnections and front-end gasification for our first commercial facility. We believe our commercialization activities are being completed at a pace that can support initial commercial production of renewable gasoline as early as the first half of 2025.



We plan to grow our business by building and operating a portfolio of commercial production facilities. Currently, we have three additional production facilities planned and four potential production facility development opportunities identified. We also expect there to be expansion opportunities at the approximately 700 landfills across the United States that intake sufficient volumes of MSW to supply one of our facilities as well as numerous additional locations using other renewable feedstocks. We believe the number of identified and planned potential production facilities bode well for our potential future success. We plan to commence pre-FEED studies on these three additional production facilities in 2023 and complete two of the facilities in 2025 and the remaining facility in 2026. We expect the total capital expenditures for these additional production facilities to be approximately $900 million, and we expect to fund these projects with equity and project-related debt.



Expansion of Commercial Operations and Customer Base



We also expect to achieve growth through the expansion of our in-process projects as the facilities are expanded or otherwise begin to produce renewable gasoline. We also intend to license our technology in places where we do not anticipate deploying our own capital. Additionally, we intend to expand internationally to regions interested in our middle distillates process, like the United Kingdom, and may enter relationships with other businesses to expand our operations and to create service networks to support our production and delivery of renewable gasoline.
Establishing and Maintaining Relationships with Key Strategic Partners



We have established, maintained and managed strategic relationships with Waste Management, InEnTec and EcoStrat, who devote the resources to promote mutually beneficial business relationships and grow our business. To expand our business, we will continue to identify and evaluate development and partnership opportunities and other suitable and scalable business relationships.
Developing and Advancing Technology



Just as we refocused the use and application of our STG+® technology from using natural gas as a feedstock to using renewable biomass, MSW and other feedstocks, our R&D team is continuously researching and developing ways to improve our technology and meet our customers’ energy needs. Using our innovative technology platform and robust intellectual property portfolio, we are well-positioned to continue making technology advancements over time. Additionally, we intend to develop or acquire additional intellectual property, such as processes for sustainable diesel and aviation fuel, as well as other complementary technologies.
Formation, Business Combination and Related Transactions



Intermediate was formed in July 2020 in connection with its acquisition of our demonstration facility, laboratory, office space and intellectual property, including our patented STG+® process technology from Primus. In connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, Holdings contributed to OpCo 100% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Intermediate in exchange for 22,500,000 Class C OpCo Units and 22,500,000 shares of Class C Common Stock of Verde Clean Fuels. In connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, we completed a private placement of 3,200,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for gross proceeds of $32.0 million.



Verde Clean Fuels has retained its “up-C” structure, whereby all of the equity interests in Intermediate are directly held by OpCo and the Company’s sole assets are its equity interests in OpCo.





2







The up-C structure allows Holdings to retain its equity ownership through Opco, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of Class C Opco Units, and provides potential future tax benefits for Verde Clean Fuels when the holders of Class C Opco Units ultimately exchange their Class C Opco Units and shares of the Company’s Class C Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock in the Company. The Company is the sole managing member of Opco. As such, the Company consolidates Opco, and the unitholders that hold economic interests directly in Opco are presented as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s financial statements.



Holders of Class C Opco Units, other than Verde Clean Fuels, have the right (a “redemption right”), subject to certain limitations, to exchange all or a portion of its Class C Opco Units and a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock for, at Opco’s election, (i) shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, or (ii) a equivalent amount of cash.



CENAQ Sponsor and Holdings are each subject to a lock-up period that expires on the earlier of (A) six months following Closing or (B) subsequent to Closing, (x) if the last sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) consecutive trading day period commencing at least seventy-five (75) days after Closing or (y) the date on which Verde Clean Fuels completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of Verde Clean Fuels’ stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A Common Stock for cash, securities or other property.



Our Facilities and Projects



We own a demonstration facility and office space in Hillsborough, New Jersey. Our first commercial production facility, which we expect to be operational by the first half of 2025, will be in Maricopa, Arizona.
Our Intellectual Property and Technology



As of December 31, 2022, Intermediate had been issued 28 patents globally, including 8 patents in the U.S., and had 3 pending patent applications globally. These patents, filed across 14 jurisdictions, including the U.S., protect key aspects of our technology, including the STG+® process, our proprietary method for converting syngas into gasoline. We believe our intellectual property rights are important assets for our success, providing a significant competitive advantage, and we aggressively protect these rights to maintain our competitive advantage in the market. Our U.S. patents expire on dates ranging from 2032 through 2039. We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new technology and inventions, and we are prepared to file additional patent applications when we determine it would benefit our business to do so.



We own or have adequate rights to use the intellectual property associated with the STG+® technology. Approximately 17 patents or patent applications in our patent portfolio support and protect our ability to produce commodity-grade gasoline from syngas, 14 patents or patent applications relate to the specific fuel composition produced by our proprietary systems and certain claims of our patents relate potential future enhancements to our technology. We manage our patent portfolio to maximize the lifecycle of protecting our intellectual property and various components and aspects of our system are protected by patents that will expire at staggered times.



Strategic Relationships



InEnTec Inc.



We have selected InEnTec as a strategic partner for the buildout of our first commercial production facility in Maricopa, Arizona, which we expect to be operational by the first half of 2025. InEnTec will provide gasification services in connection with the project. We anticipate that InEnTec will be an integral member in the success of our first commercial production facility as production of renewable gasoline is dependent upon the combination of InEnTec’s existing third-party gasification technology with our STG+® process. InEnTec is also an important strategic relationship of ours because, as an active product developer, InEnTec has a portfolio of projects in which we may have an opportunity to participate in the future.
Waste Management, Inc.



Waste Management is a strategic partner for the buildout of our first planned commercial production facility in Maricopa, Arizona. Under our current plans, Waste Management would provide site and feedstock logistics in connection with the project, which we expect to require approximately 150,000 tons of feedstock per year for the first phase.

Other Important Relationships



EcoStrat is a service provider we use to assist us in finding locations for our commercial production facilities, as well as securing volume commitments once our commercial production facilities are completed and operations have commenced.



IHI E&C International Corporation (“IHI”) is our primary contractor for front-end engineering and design services (“FEED”) and is expected to perform Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) services. We are a party to agreements with IHI and/or its subcontractors for the various aspects of FEED and EPC services needs.



Koch Modular Process Systems, LLC (“KMPS”) is an important subcontractor of IHI and provides technical information to IHI and/or its subcontractors for FEED execution.



Market Opportunity



Demand for Renewable Gasoline



Energy markets are undergoing dramatic changes as they shift from fossil fuels to carbon-reduced and carbon-free sources. A series of technological, economic, regulatory, social and investor pressures are leading the drive to decarbonize energy and other sectors, such as transportation.



According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (the “EIA”) “2022 Annual Energy Outlook” and “U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 2020,” gasoline accounts for more than 20% of the U.S.’s energy-related Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”) emissions and overall, transportation represents approximately 37% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions (or 1,903 million tons of CO2). Within the 37% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions that is caused by the transportation sector, in 2019, gasoline represented approximately 56% of the total transportation emissions (or 1,086 million tons of CO2) and produced over twice as much emissions than diesel, which produced approximately 468 million tons of CO2) and over four times more emissions than aviation fuel, which produced approximately 261 million tons of CO2). Uptake on competing emissions-reduction technologies, such as electric vehicles, is growing, but, according to BloombergNEF, is only expected to reach 24% of the projected 2035 total vehicle fleet in the U.S. As a result, the EIA predicts 2035 gasoline demand to be at 92-102% of 2022 levels. According to the EIA’s “2022 Annual Energy Outlook,” petroleum and natural gas are projected to remain as the most-consumed source of energy in the U.S. through 2050, and motor gasoline is projected to be the most commonly-used transportation fuel despite electric vehicles gaining market share.



Renewable gasoline reduces lifecycle emissions by over 60% compared to traditional fossil fuel-based gasoline based on GREET-style CI analysis. Further, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) “National Overview: Facts and Figures on Materials, Wastes and Recycling and Landfill Methane Outreach Program,” approximately 292 million tons of MSW is generated annually, which consists of about 60% cellulosic material that can be utilized as feedstock, which can create an estimated 25 billion gallons of renewable gasoline based on the assumption that one ton of MSW can generate 140 gallons of renewable gasoline using our STG+® process. Achieving production of 25 billion gallons of renewable gasoline could meet approximately 19% of estimated 2022 gasoline demand of 132 billion gallons according to the EIA. Renewable gasoline can be utilized within the existing 268 million internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles in the U.S. without vehicle modification. Additionally, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores’ “The US Petroleum Industry Statistics Definitions,” there are over 145 thousand gas stations nationwide. Our renewable gasoline will be able to utilize essentially all of the existing fossil fuel gasoline distribution and retailing infrastructure, making our renewable gasoline a drop-in solution that does not require a change in consumer behavior.



Based on the Fuel Institute’s “Life Cycle Analysis Comparison, 2022,” a single conventional ICE vehicle is accountable for 66 tons of CO2 over a 200,000-mile life, which includes 5 tons of CO2 generated from the manufacturing process, 12 tons of CO2 generated from the production and processing of the oil and gasoline fuel used in the vehicle and 48 tons of CO2 generated from vehicle emissions. Intermediate estimates that an ICE vehicle utilizing renewable gasoline would be accountable for 28 tons of CO2 over a 200,000-mile life, which includes five tons of CO2 generated from the manufacturing process, negative 25 tons of CO2 from the production of the renewable gasoline fuel used in the vehicle and 48 tons of CO2 generated from vehicle emissions. As a result, an ICE vehicle running on renewable gasoline is projected to emit approximately 57% less CO2 than the same vehicle running on traditional hydrocarbon-based gasoline.

Competition



Our traditional competitors in the renewable fuel market include companies in the incumbent petroleum-based industry, as well as those in the emerging renewable fuels industry and others selling carbon credits as a commodity. Our direct competitors are limited. There are only two other companies of which we are aware that also have their own technology to convert syngas into renewable gasoline: ExxonMobil Corporation (“Exxon”) and Haldor Topsoe (“Topsoe”). Although Exxon’s chemistry process is similar to Intermediate’s, Exxon has historically focused on larger scale projects and markets. Topsoe, though larger than Intermediate, only licenses its technology and processes to others and does not produce renewable liquid hydrocarbons.



We believe our technology, scale, and development capabilities are the competitive strengths that differentiate us from our competition. Utilizing biomass through a gasifier to produce syngas, our proprietary STG+® process can efficiently and economically convert syngas to gasoline. Intermediate plans to design its facilities to use modular construction and to operate at a scale that makes the use of renewable feedstocks viable. We believe that when using biomass as a feedstock, our ability to design facilities on a smaller scale gives us a competitive advantage, because we are able to deploy equipment to the feedstock rather than being required to build a large central facility. The economies of scale that may benefit a larger facility we believe are lost with the increased logistics and materials handling costs that come with the larger supply radius required to feed a large-scale facility. Intermediate’s process remains in a vapor phase throughout resulting in a lower piece-count and, therefore, lower capital cost.



Research & Development



Primus invested over $110 million in developing and patenting its technology and conducted over 10,500 hours of testing at our Hillsborough, New Jersey demonstration facility. Since we acquired Primus’ assets, our team has invested approximately $5 million to design the chemical processes and systems required to produce an acceptable synthesis gas from renewable feedstocks and plans to invest $3 million to engage a new FEED study, which is expected to take approximately eight months to complete. Any future FEED studies we intend to commence we anticipate will focus on the conversion of waste, biomass and other biogenic-feedstocks for future facilities we believe could require an estimated $100 to $200 million of additional capital expenditures per facility and take 18 to 24 months to construct. Our R&D team is also in the process of developing additional process technology to produce middle distillates, including diesel.
Raw Materials and Suppliers



We plan to use renewable feedstocks, such as biomass and MSW, as well as natural gas (including synthetic natural gas) and other feedstocks to produce our renewable gasoline. We plan on contracting with various suppliers for renewable feedstocks, and intend to work with other commercial waste companies, agricultural industry participants and landowners to source our renewable feedstocks and maintain an established supply of product inputs. Additionally, to lower feedstock costs and maximize the ease of access to sufficient feedstock volumes for commercial production, we intend to develop future commercial production facilities in locations near biomass and MSW, natural gas or other feedstock sources. We do not expect to be dependent on sole source or limited source suppliers for any of our raw materials or chemicals. Additionally, we expect to rely on various suppliers for the catalysts we use in our STG+® process. We do not expect to be dependent on a sole source for our supply of catalysts.
Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2022, we had five full-time employees, engaged six consultants on a part-time basis and one consultant on a full-time basis. Our workforce is mostly concentrated in the Texas and New Jersey regions. We have a seasoned leadership team with over 100 years of cumulative experience in the renewables or a functionally equivalent industry. Our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets, and is focused on expanding our diversity, enhancing capability development and succession planning. Accordingly, we regularly review employee development and succession plans for each of our functions to identify and develop our pipeline of talent. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing.
Customers



With RBOB as our product, we are able to sell to a broad range of potential counterparties including refiners and importers of gasoline, distributors, blenders, retailers and trading organizations, among others. We intend to enter into offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties with terms that are acceptable to lenders and us as support for our project financing.



Renewable gasoline. We transitioned into the renewable energy industry after applying our STG+® technology to focus on renewable inputs, expanding our potential customer base beyond the natural gas sector and traditional gasoline consumers in this space. Our potential customers will generally include companies obligated to purchase physical volumes of renewable fuel under the RFS program, such as refiners, blenders, fuel distributors and retailers and marketers, as well as trading shops.



Carbon credits. Expanding the application of our STG+® technology will also expand how we can create revenue. The value of our operations will include carbon credits derived from converting waste and other bio-feedstocks into a single, finished fuel, which can have significant value. For example, certain gasoline produced from renewable feedstock, such as biomass, qualifies under the RFS for the D3 RIN (a carbon credit). Similarly, we expect that gasoline produced in this fashion will also qualify for various state carbon programs including California’s LCFS. We anticipate that we will produce 1.5 RINs per gallon of gasoline, which can be sold alongside each gallon of renewable gasoline as a separate commodity to customers who can sell the RINs later or sole into forward or futures markets.



However, as with other government programs the use requirements of the RFS program and similar state-level programs are subject to change, which could materially harm our ability to operate profitably.

Regulatory Environment



Demand for renewable fuel has grown significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue to grow due in part to federal requirements for cellulosic biofuel volume obligations through programs such as the RFS program, which was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “Energy Act”), which amended the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and expanded through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “EISA”). The EISA requires the use of specific volumes of biofuel in the U.S. and is aimed at (i) increasing energy security by reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and establishing domestic green fuel related industries and (ii) improving the environment through the reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Under the RFS program, transportation fuel sold in the U.S. must contain a certain minimum volume of renewable fuel. See “Business — Regulatory Mandates and Governmental Funding” for more information. However, as stated above, the RFS program is subject to change, including by modification or repeal by Congressional action or action by the EPA or the EPA administrator. Similarly, state-level programs like California’s LCFS are also subject to change.
Social and Environmental Preferences and Investor Pressures



The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and rising temperature and the increased health and socio-economic stability of at-risk populations, have emphasized the need to reduce greenhouse gases and move toward reduced carbon energy solutions. Because of this, environmentally-conscious policies, initiatives and businesses are growing in value and preference.



ESG investing has accelerated as institutional investors shift their portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets. This shift in investor sentiment has caused many large integrated energy companies to set decarbonization strategies and diversify into different forms of carbon-free and carbon-reduced energy.



Governmental Regulations



Our future operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations governing environmental protection and human health and safety. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly, and noncompliance can result in substantial penalties. Laws and regulations that may have an impact on our business include:

● | The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (or “CERCLA”) and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of the site where the release occurred, past owners and operators of the site, and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Responsible parties under CERCLA may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Additionally, it is not uncommon for third parties to assert claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (or “RCRA”), is the principal federal statute governing the management of wastes, including the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a generator or transporter of hazardous waste or an owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility. We anticipate that many wastes generated by our manufacturing facility or process will be governed by RCRA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal Water Pollution Control Act (also referred to as the “Clean Water Act”) imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is possible that additional restrictions may be imposed in the future. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for discharges of oil and other pollutants and imposes liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. Comparable state statutes impose liability and authorize penalties in the case of an unauthorized discharge of petroleum or its derivatives or other pollutants into state waters.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The CAA and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including facilities involved in manufacturing biofuels. New facilities are generally required to obtain permits before operations can commence, and new or existing facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures to install air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal Endangered Species Act, the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and similar federal and state wildlife protection laws prohibit or restrict activities that could adversely impact protected plant and animal species or habitats. Construction of facilities could be prohibited or delayed in areas where such protected species or habitats may be located, or mitigation may be required to accommodate such activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new clean hydrogen production tax credit, a new credit for sustainable aviation fuel, credits for the production and purchase of electric vehicles, expanding eligibility for and increasing the value of the carbon capture and sequestration credit, extending the biodiesel, renewable diesel and alternative fuels tax credit, funding biofuel refueling infrastructure and additional funding for working lands conservation programs for farmers. The IR Act could have many potential impacts on our business that we are continuing to evaluate, including new opportunities to access production tax credits, carbon sequestration credits, and other benefits, which could result in changes in the configuration of the plant, and could slightly delay commercial operation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may be required to obtain certain permits to construct and operate our facilities, including those related to air emissions, solid and hazardous waste management and water quality. These permits can be difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Our ability to obtain these permits could be impacted by opposition from various stakeholders. Once operational, our facilities will also need to maintain compliance with these permits.



In additional to compliance with environmental regulations, we expect that our future operations will be subject to federal RFS program regulations. The EPA administers the RFS program with volume requirements for several categories of renewable fuels. The EPA calculates a blending standard annually based on estimates of gasoline usage from the EIA. Different quotas and blending requirements are determined for cellulosic biofuels, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuels and total renewable fuel. RINs are used to ensure that the prescribed levels of blending are met. The Energy Act’s RFS regulations establish rules for fuel supplied and administer the RIN system for compliance, trading credits and rules for waivers. We anticipate that our renewable gasoline and other future products will benefit from the RFS program. However, as stated above, the use requirements of the RFS program or state programs could change, which may impact our products and harm our ability to operate profitably. See “Business— Regulatory Mandates and Government Funding” for more information.



Regulatory Mandates and Government Funding



Strong increases in the federal requirement of cellulosic biofuel volume obligations position us to benefit as a producer of renewable gasoline.



The RFS program was created under the Energy Act, which amended the CAA. The EISA further amended the CAA by expanding the RFS program. The EPA implements the RFS program under the guidance of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy.



The RFS program is a federal policy that requires a certain volume of renewable fuel to replace or reduce the quantity of petroleum-based transportation fuel, heating oil or aviation fuel. The four renewable fuel categories under the RFS are:




● | biomass-based diesel; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cellulosic biofuel; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | advanced biofuel; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | total renewable fuel. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe our renewable gasoline will qualify under the cellulosic biofuel category, which qualifies for D3 RINs.



The 2007 enactment of EISA significantly increased the size of the program and included key changes, including:




● | boosting the long-term goals to 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extending yearly volume requirements out to 2022; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adding explicit definitions for renewable fuels to qualify (e.g., renewable biomass, GHG emissions); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creating grandfathering allowances for volumes from certain existing facilities; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | including specific types of waiver authorities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The CAA provides the EPA with the authority to adjust cellulosic, advanced and total volumes set by Congress as part of the annual rule process.



The statute also contains a general waiver authority that allows the Administrator to waive the RFS volumes, in whole or in part, based on a determination that implementation of the program is causing severe economic or environmental harm, or based on inadequate domestic supply.



For a fuel to qualify as a renewable fuel under the RFS program, the EPA must determine that the fuel qualifies under the statute and regulations. Among other requirements, fuels must achieve a reduction in GHG emissions as compared to a 2005 petroleum baseline.

The EPA has approved fuel pathways under the RFS program under all four categories of renewable fuel. Advanced pathways already approved include ethanol made from sugarcane, jet fuel made from camelina, cellulosic ethanol made from corn stover, compressed natural gas from municipal wastewater treatment facility digesters and others. Additional requirements of the RFS program include:




● | biomass-based diesel must meet a 50% lifecycle GHG reduction; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cellulosic biofuel must be produced from cellulose, hemicellulose or lignin and must meet a 60% lifecycle GHG reduction; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advanced biofuel can be produced from qualifying renewable biomass (except corn starch) and must meet a 50% GHG reduction; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | renewable (or conventional) fuel typically refers to ethanol derived from corn starch and must meet a 20% lifecycle GHG reduction threshold.

Lifecycle GHG reduction comparisons are based on a 2005 petroleum baseline as mandated by EISA. Biofuel facilities (domestic and foreign) that were producing fuel prior to enactment of EISA in 2007 are “grandfathered” under the statute, meaning these facilities are not required to meet the GHG reductions.



The EPA continues to review and approve new pathways, including for fuels made with advanced technologies or with new feedstocks. Certain biofuels, such as our renewable gasoline, are similar enough to gasoline or diesel that they do not have to be blended, but can be simply “dropped in” to existing petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in biofuels directly replace petroleum-based fuels and hold particular promise for the future.



Obligated Parties under the RFS program are refiners or importers of gasoline or diesel fuel. Compliance is achieved by blending renewable fuels into transportation fuel, or by obtaining credits, RINs, to meet an EPA-specified Renewable Volume Obligation (“RVO”).



The EPA calculates and establishes RVOs every year through rulemaking, based on the CAA volume requirements and projections of gasoline and diesel production for the coming year. The standards are converted into a percentage and Obligated Parties must demonstrate compliance annually.



Each fuel type is assigned a “D-code” — a code that identifies the renewable fuel type — based on the feedstock used, fuel type produced, energy inputs and GHG reduction thresholds, among other requirements. The four categories of renewable fuel have the following assigned D-codes:




● | Cellulosic biofuel is assigned a D-code of 3 (e.g., cellulosic biofuel) or D-code of 7 (cellulosic diesel); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Biomass-based diesel is assigned a D-code of 4; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advanced biofuel is assigned a D-code of 5; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Renewable fuel (non-advanced/conventional biofuel) is assigned a D-code of 6 (grandfathered fuels are also assigned a D-code of 6); and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The production of our renewable gasoline is expected to qualify for a D-code of 3. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Obligated Parties use RINs to demonstrate compliance with the standard. These parties must obtain sufficient RINs for each category in order to demonstrate compliance with the annual standard. Some of the regulations regarding RINs include the following:




● | RINs are generated when a producer makes a gallon of renewable fuel. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At the end of the compliance year, Obligated Parties use RINs to demonstrate compliance. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | RINs can be traded between parties. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obligated Parties can buy gallons of renewable fuel with RINs attached. They can also buy RINs on the open market. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obligated Parties can carry over unused RINs between compliance years. They may carry a compliance deficit into the next year. This deficit must be made up the following year.

The RFS program’s four renewable fuel standards are nested within each other. This means the fuel with a higher GHG reduction threshold can be used to meet the standards for a lower GHG reduction threshold. For example, fuels or RINs for advanced biofuel (i.e., cellulosic, biodiesel or sugarcane ethanol) can be used to meet the total renewable fuel standards (i.e., corn ethanol).



For cellulosic standards, an additional flexibility is provided. Cellulosic waiver credits (“CWCs”) are offered by the Energy Act at a price determined by a formula in the statute. Obligated Parties have the option of purchasing CWCs plus an advanced RIN in lieu of blending cellulosic biofuel or obtaining a cellulosic RIN.



On November 15, 2021, the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and JOBS Act was signed into law that includes $65 billion in funding for power and grid investments. This includes investments in grid reliability and resiliency as well as clean energy technologies such as carbon capture, hydrogen and advanced nuclear, including small modular reactors. Additionally, on December 8, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order mandating all electricity procured by the government be 100% carbon pollution-free by 2030, including at least 50% from around-the-clock dispatchable generation sources. The order also requires that federally owned buildings produce no net emissions by 2045 and that each federal agency achieve 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035.



At the international level, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, which resulted in an agreement intended to nationally determine their contributions and set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. In November 2019, plans were formally announced for the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement with an effective exit date in November 2020. In February 2021, the current administration announced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with a new “nationally determined contribution” for U.S. GHG emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, in 2021, President Biden publicly announced the Global Methane Pledge, a pact that aims to reduce global methane emissions at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Since its formal launch at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, over 100 countries have joined the pledge.
