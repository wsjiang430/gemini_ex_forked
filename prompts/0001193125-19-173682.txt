Introduction
------------

 We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company with limited liability (meaning that our shareholders have no liability, as members of our company, for the liabilities of our company over and above the amount already paid for their shares) and formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements with, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. On March 15, 2019, we issued a press release announcing that we have executed a non-binding Letter of Intent to merge with DermTech, Inc. (DermTech), a Delaware corporation and a leading moleculargenomics company, with an initial focus on skin cancer, that develops and markets novel non-invasive diagnostic tests. On May 22, 2019 and May 23, 2019, we entered into separate subscription agreements (each, a Subscription Agreement) with new health care focused institutional investors as well as certain existing investors in DermTech (each, a Subscriber), pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase an aggregate of 6,153,847 shares (the PIPE Shares) of our common stock for a purchase price of $3.25 per share, in a private placement in which we will raise an aggregate of approximately $20,000,000, less certain offering related expenses payable by us (the Private Placement). The PIPE Shares are identical to the shares of common stock that will be held by our public stockholders at the time of the closing of the Merger, as defined below. The closing of the sale of PIPE Shares will be contingent upon, among other things, the substantially concurrent consummation of the Merger. On May 29, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with DermTech and DT Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary company of the Company incorporated in Delaware (Merger Sub), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into DermTech (the Merger), with DermTech surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon the closing of the Merger, all of DermTechs outstanding common stock and preferred stock will be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares of the Company less the total number of shares of our common stock that can be acquired or received pursuant to certain options, restricted stock units and warrants of DermTech, as set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
 On June 23, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering of 14,375,000 units (including 1,875,000 units sold pursuant to the underwriters exercising their over-allotment option), with each unit consisting of one ordinary share, one warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per whole share and one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. Each warrant will become exercisable on the completion of our business combination. The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 The units in our initial public offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $143,750,000. Cowen Investments acted as the sole book running manager and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. acted as co-manager of the offering. The securities sold in the offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-218093), or our registration statement. The SEC declared our registration statement effective on June 19, 2017. 
 We paid a total of $2,875,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions and $514,467 for other costs and expenses related to our initial public offering. In addition, the underwriters agreed to defer $5,031,250 in underwriting discounts and commissions, and up to this amount will be payable upon consummation of the business combination. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $5,031,250 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be released from the trust account upon consummation of the business combination, if consummated) and the estimated offering expenses, the total net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was $145,973,033, of which $145,187,500 (or $10.10 per unit sold in our initial public offering) was placed in the trust account. 
 On March 21, 2019, at the special meeting of shareholders, our shareholders approved an amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination to September 23, 2019. In connection with the extension, an aggregate of 13,187,468 ordinary shares was redeemed for an aggregate payment of approximately $136.9 million out of our trust account. 
 Business Strategy 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 
5 


 Opportunities for organic growth and add-on acquisitions. We will seek targets that we believe we can grow both organically and through acquisitions. We intend to leverage the industry experience and financial acumen of our management team to identify additional operational improvement opportunities for the target business. In addition, we believe that we can utilize our extensive networks to source proprietary opportunities and execute transactions that will help the business or businesses we acquire grow through further acquisitions if appropriate or beneficial. 
 Offers an unrecognized value proposition. We will conduct due diligence with respect to potential business combination targets, with a goal of uncovering value that has been unrecognized and would allow us to invest in companies and buy assets at prices that we believe to be below intrinsic value. In the case of turnaround opportunities, we expect to only acquire companies where we can utilize our operating experience, industry networks and capital to implement a turnaround plan that addresses key aspects of underperformance. The ideal turnaround candidates are those that may require a recapitalization, improvements in working capital management, operational improvements that result in margin expansion, or those that could benefit from the application of new technology that could improve productivity or result in new business orders. 
 History of, or potential for, free cash flow generation. We will seek one or more businesses or assets that have a history of, or potential for, strong, stable free cash flow generation, with predictable and recurring revenue streams. 
 Experienced and motivated management team. We will seek one or more businesses or assets that have strong, experienced management teams or those that provide a platform for us to assemble an effective and experienced management team. We will focus on management teams with a track record of driving revenue growth, enhancing profitability and creating value for their shareholders. 
 Underperforming potential peak operational and/or financial performance capabilities. We believe that given our management teams experience with value-oriented investing, we are well-positioned to identify targets where additional capital investment and effective sponsorship will result in improvements in operational and/or financial performance. 
 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our sponsor and management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us. In addition, although we intend to focus on identifying business combination candidates in the healthcare services and manufacturing industries, we will consider a business combination candidate outside of these industries if we determine that such candidate offers an attractive opportunity for our company.

You should not rely on the historical record of our management teams performance as indicative of our future performance. None of our officers or directors has had experience with any blank check companies in the past.

 Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets 
 Our management team and our sponsor have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships. This network has been developed through their experience in sourcing, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; reputation for integrity and fair dealing with sellers, capital providers and target management teams; and experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. This network has provided our management team and our sponsor with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team and our sponsor will provide us with an important source of business combination opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, private equity firms, consultants, accounting firms and business enterprises. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm, or independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. 
 Our officers and directors have agreed not to become involved with another publicly listed blank check company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), prior to us announcing an agreement to acquire our initial business combination, or the expiration of the period for us to announce and/or complete our initial business combination. 
 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection with our initial business combination. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire substantially all of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than substantially all of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses even if the acquisitions of the target businesses are not closed simultaneously. Although we have no commitments as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, in connection with an initial business combination, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. Furthermore, we may issue a substantial number of additional ordinary or preferred shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan upon or after consummation of our initial business combination, including in connection with the Private Placement.

 Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we must complete our initial business combination by September 23, 2019. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate our initial business combination within such time period. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by September 23, 2019, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004, or the Companies Act. 
 Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter voluntary liquidation which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the companys creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution. 
 Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and private units if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 However, if our initial shareholders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by September 23, 2019. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account or interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets. 
 Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.10, plus interest (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses). 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out

  of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.10 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. Other than as described above, none of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.10 per share and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.10 per share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to funds not held in the trust account and the interest income earned on the balance of the trust account (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses) with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act, 2003 of the British Virgin Islands, or the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the Company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the companys liabilities exceeds its assets, or the Company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a voidable transaction for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as unfair preferences or transactions at an undervalue. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part. 
 Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them. 
 Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of a redemption of the public shares prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by September 23, 2019, (ii) if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate or (iii) if they redeem their shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 23, 2019 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

 Employees 
 We have two executive officers, neither of whom is paid a salary by us. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have registered our units, ordinary shares, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our Annual Report on Form 10-K contains consolidated financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. Our filings are available to the public via the Internet at the SECs website located at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document that we file with the SEC at the SECs public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. For more information, please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
We will provide shareholders with audited consolidated financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These consolidated financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary consolidated financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. 
 We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion or our total revenues exceed $1.07 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
