Item 1. Business
The Company
 We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1986 and opened our first retail store in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on October 9, 1986. Since then, we have become a leading provider of business services and supplies, products and technology solutions through our fully integrated business-to-business (“B2B”) distribution platform of 1,361 retail stores, online presence, and dedicated sales professionals and technicians to retail consumers and small, medium and enterprise businesses, all supported by our world-class supply chain facilities and delivery operations. Through our banner brands Office Depot®, OfficeMax®, CompuCom® and Grand & Toy®, we offer our customers the tools and resources they need to focus on their passion of starting, growing and running their businesses. 
 Our long-term strategy to deliver customer-focused value through our integrated B2B distribution platform is founded on three strategic pillars:

At December 29, 2018, our operations are organized into three reportable segments (or “Divisions”): Business Solutions Division, which we also refer to as BSD, Retail Division and the CompuCom Division. The CompuCom Division was formed after the acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. (“CompuCom”) on November 8, 2017. Additional information regarding our Divisions and operations in geographic areas is presented in Part II — Item 7. “MD&A” and in Note 5. “Segment Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part IV — Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report.

Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol ODP.

Acquisitions
 
Over the last two years, we have been undergoing a strategic transformation to pivot Office Depot into an integrated B2B distribution platform, with the objective of expanding our product offerings to include value-added services for our customers and capture greater market share. As part of this transformation, we acquired CompuCom in 2017, as further described herein, and an enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider in 2018. The latter gives us access to a platform for selling or providing Internet of Things (“IoT”) related hardware and projects to the education market. IoT refers to the connection of intelligent systems and devices to allow them to automatically share information so that systems and devices work intelligently together to develop and enhance solutions and reduce human intervention. 
 
To strengthen our core operations, over the last two years we have also expanded the reach of our distribution network by identifying and acquiring profitable regional office supply distribution businesses serving small and mid-market customers in geographic areas that were previously underserved by our network. This has allowed, and will continue to allow, for an effective and accretive means to expand our distribution reach, target new business customers and grow our offerings beyond traditional office supplies.
 The operating results of these companies are combined with our operating results subsequent to their purchase dates. The operating results of the acquired businesses are included in the Business Solutions Division, whereas the operating results of CompuCom and the enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider are included in the CompuCom Division. Refer to Note 2. “Acquisitions” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Fiscal Year
 Our fiscal year results are based on a 52- or 53-week calendar ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2018 had 52 weeks and ended on December 29, 2018. Fiscal year 2017 had 52 weeks and ended on December 30, 2017. Fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks and ended on December 31, 2016. Certain subsidiaries, including CompuCom, operate on a calendar year basis; however, the reporting difference did not have a material impact on 2018 and the other periods presented.
Business Solutions Division
 Our Business Solutions Division provides its customers with nationally branded and our private branded office supply and adjacency products and services in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. Our customers are served through a dedicated sales force, catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our Internet websites. Adjacency products primarily include cleaning and breakroom supplies, technology and furniture and our service offerings are comprised of copy and print services, product subscriptions, and managed print and fulfillment services. 
 The Business Solutions Division is comprised of two main sales channels: contract and direct. 
 Our contract sales channel serves business customers including small, medium, and enterprise businesses as well as schools and local, state and national governmental agencies. We also enter into agreements with consortiums to sell to entities across many industries, including government and non-profit entities, in non-exclusive buying arrangements. 
 Our direct sales channel primarily serves small to medium-sized customers. Direct customers can order products through our Internet website, from our catalogs, or by phone. Website functionality provides customers the convenience of using the loyalty program and offers suggestions by product ratings, pricing, and brand, among other features. Customer orders are fulfilled through our common supply chain. See “Supply Chain” section below for additional information on our supply chain network.
 Beginning 2017, we have implemented several initiatives to strengthen the core of our Business Solutions Division, including the following:
  
• | expanding through strategic acquisitions that increase selling resources in the field, stretch our geographical reach, grow our small and medium customer segments, and increase our sales in the aforementioned adjacency categories
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | focus on demand-generation via a shift to digital marketing and investment in our eCommerce presence
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | realignment of our sales organization aimed at improving customer acquisition and retention trends
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adding dedicated selling and operational resources to drive sales in our adjacency categories
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | partnering with key vendors to add new products to our assortment of offerings
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | capturing cross-selling opportunities with CompuCom

Retail Division
 The Retail Division markets a broad assortment of merchandise through our chain of retail stores throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The retail stores operate under both the Office Depot or OfficeMax brands, though systems, processes and offerings have converged. We currently offer products in three categories: supplies, technology, and furniture and other. See “Merchandising and Services” section below for additional information on our product categories. In addition, our Retail Division offers a range of business-related services targeted to small businesses, technology support services as well as printing, copying, mailing and shipping services. In addition, the print needs for retail and business customers are also facilitated through our regional print production centers.
 
At the end of 2018, the Retail Division operated 1,361 retail stores which includes locations temporarily closed for remodeling. We have a broad representation across North America with the largest concentration of our retail stores in Texas, California, and Florida. Most of our retail stores are located in leased facilities that currently average over 20,000 square feet. Beginning 2016, we have redesigned the layout of 106 stores to enhance our in-store experience through a curated assortment of products, better product adjacencies, easier navigation and signage, and increased space dedicated to expanded service offerings. To better serve our customers any way they choose to shop, we have a Buy Online-Pickup in Store offering in all locations and offer same-day store delivery in selected markets. Sales under these programs are serviced by store employees and fulfilled with store inventory and therefore are reported in the Retail Division results. 
 
In May 2018, we introduced Workonomy™, a variety of business services married with “human touch” expertise to small and medium-sized businesses. The new Workonomy offering provides customers with enhanced tools and services as well as access to remote and in-person advisors and technical support, including tech services kiosks across 200 retail stores. Our Workonomy solutions also include payroll support, bookkeeping, storage and shredding, shipping and printing, and workspace planning and assembly services. We offer Workonomy business services on our eCommerce platform, in store, and through a dedicated sales team. In 2018, we also launched our first ever Workonomy integrated co-working space within one of our retail locations in Los Gatos, California. 
 In 2016, we announced the results of a comprehensive business review (the “Comprehensive Business Review”), which included the closure of up to 300 stores in North America over a three-year period, and the reduction of operating and general and administrative expenses through efficiencies and organizational optimization. Under the Comprehensive Business Review, we closed a total of 154 stores (19 in 2018, 63 in 2017 and 72 
in 2016). We expect to close approximately 50 additional stores through the end of the program in 2019.
 CompuCom Division
 The CompuCom Division was formed after our acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. on November 8, 2017. CompuCom provides information technology (“IT”) outsourcing services and products to enterprise organizations in the United States and Canada, and offers a broad range of solutions including end user computing support, managed IT services, data center monitoring and management, service desk, network infrastructure, IT workforce solutions, mobile device management and cloud services. 
 CompuCom’s unique capabilities allow us to enhance our service offerings and attract new customers. The minimal overlap between CompuCom’s customer base and the customer base of our Business Solutions and Retail Divisions allows us to capture cross-selling opportunities by offering a full suite of products and services. We are leveraging our approximately 6,000 highly certified CompuCom technicians to serve our extensive small, medium-sized, and large enterprise business customers who require technical support. 
 Supply Chain
 We operate a network of distribution centers (or “DCs”) and crossdock facilities across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada, including two DCs which support the operations of CompuCom. Our DCs fulfill customer orders while crossdocks are smaller flow-through facilities where merchandise is sorted for distribution and shipped to fulfill the inventory needs of our retail locations. Our supply chain operations are also supported by a dedicated fleet of over 1,000 transportation vehicles. With our network of DCs, crossdocks, and vehicles, we are capable of providing next-day delivery services for approximately 98.5% of the population in the United States. 
 
We continue to invest in our supply chain network, focusing on further enhancing our capabilities, increasing efficiency and lowering our costs. For example, we have grown our private fleet of transportation vehicles and introduced automated technology and robotics into our DCs and crossdock facilities. We have also installed new software that optimizes our network and allows us greater insight to our supply chain costs, providing us the ability to make better decisions and improve profitability. These investments position us to pursue opportunities beyond our traditional business, including utilizing our supply chain as a logistics service for third parties, including customers.

Excluding the two DCs supporting the CompuCom operations, DC and crossdock facilities’ costs, such as real estate, technology, labor, depreciation and inventory are allocated to the Retail and Business Solutions Divisions based on the relative services provided. For the two DCs supporting the CompuCom operations, these costs are included within the CompuCom Division.
 We believe that inventory held in our DCs is at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated customer needs. Certain purchases are sent directly from the manufacturer to our customers or retail stores. Some supply chain facilities and some retail locations also house sales offices, showrooms, and administrative offices supporting our contract sales channel.
 As of December 29, 2018, we operated a total of 56 DCs and crossdock facilities in the United States and Canada. Refer to Item 2. “Properties” for further information.
 Out-bound delivery and inbound direct import operations are currently provided by third-party carriers along with our own vehicles.
 Merchandising and Services
 Our merchandising and services strategy is to meet our customers’ needs by offering a broad selection of nationally branded office supply and adjacency products, as well as our own private branded products and services. The selection of our private branded products has increased in breadth and level of sophistication over time. We currently offer products under such labels, including Office Depot®, OfficeMax®, Foray®, Ativa®, TUL®, Realspace®, WorkPro®, Brenton Studio®, Highmark®, and Grand & Toy®.
 
We generally classify our product offerings into three categories: (1) supplies, (2) technology, and (3) furniture and other. The supplies category includes products such as paper, writing instruments, office supplies, and cleaning and breakroom supplies. The technology category includes products such as toner and ink, printers, computers, tablets and accessories, and electronic storage. The furniture and other category includes products such as desks, seating, and luggage. 
 
We classify our service offerings into two categories: (1) technology and (2) copy, print, and other. The technology category includes the technology service offerings provided through our CompuCom Division, such as end user computing support, managed IT services, data center monitoring and management, service desk, network infrastructure, IT workforce solutions, mobile device management and cloud services, as well as technology service offerings provided in our retail stores, such as equipment installation and repair. The copy, print, and other category includes offerings such as printing of business cards, banners, documents and promotional products, copying and photo services, managed print and fulfillment services, product and service subscriptions, and sales of third party software, gift cards, warranties, remote support as well as rental income on operating lease arrangements where the Company conveys to its customers the right to use devices and other equipment for a stated period.
 Total Company sales by offering were as follows:
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
---------------------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Major products and services categories | | | | | | | | 
Products | | | | | | | | 
Supplies | | 42.7 | % | | 45.0 | % | 46.1 | %
Technology** | | 31.5 | % | | 34.7 | % | 35.8 | %
Furniture and other | | 10.4 | % | | 11.3 | % | 10.0 | %
Services | | | | | | | | 
Technology** | | 7.9 | % | | 1.5 | % | 0.6 | %
Copy, print, and other | | 7.5 | % | | 7.5 | % | 7.5 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 ** 2017 includes technology product and services sales of CompuCom subsequent to the acquisition date of November 8, 2017.
 We buy substantially all of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, industry wholesalers, and other primary suppliers, and includes direct sourcing of our private branded products from domestic and offshore sources. We enter into arrangements with vendors that can lower our unit product costs if certain volume thresholds or other criteria are met. For additional discussion regarding these arrangements, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies” in Part II — Item 7. “MD&A.”

We operate separate merchandising functions in the United States and Canada. Each function is responsible for selecting, purchasing, managing the product life cycle of our inventory, and managing pricing primarily for retail and direct selling channels. Organizationally, they are aligned under the same Corporate leadership. In recent years, we have increasingly used global offerings across the regions to further reduce our product cost while maintaining product quality.
 We operate a global sourcing office in Shenzhen, China, which allows us to better manage our product sourcing, logistics and quality assurance. This office consolidates our purchasing power with Asian factories and, in turn, helps us to increase the scope of our own branded offerings.
 Sales and Marketing
 We regularly assess consumer shopping behaviors in order to refine our strategy and identify the desired product assortment, shopping environment and purchasing methods. Identifying the most desirable and effective way to reach our customers and allowing them to shop through whichever channel they prefer will continue to be a priority. These efforts have impacted the extent, format and vehicles we use to advertise to and reach customers, our web page design, promotions and product offerings.
 Our marketing programs are designed to attract and retain customers, drive frequency of customer visits, and increase customer spend in our stores and websites. We regularly advertise in major newspapers in most of our North American markets. We advertise through local and national radio, network and cable television advertising campaigns, and direct marketing efforts, such as the internet and social networking. We have shifted a meaningful amount of our marketing efforts in recent periods to digital programs that enhance personalized offerings and promote customer satisfaction.
 Our customer loyalty and other incentive programs provide our customers with rewards that can be applied towards future purchases or other incentives. These programs enable us to effectively market to our customers and may change as customer preferences shift.
 We perform periodic competitive pricing analyses to monitor each market, and prices are adjusted as necessary to further our competitive positioning. We generally target our pricing to be competitive with other resellers of office products and providers of business services and technology solutions.
 Our customer acquisition efforts regularly shift to vehicles and formats found to be most productive for reaching the targeted class of customer. We acquire customers through e-mail and social media campaigns, online affiliate connections, on-premises sales calls, outbound sales calls, and catalogs, among others
. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated sales or receivables in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

 Additionally, we believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single
 customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
 Seasonality
 Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality, with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter, following the “back-to-business” sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the “back-to-school” sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter for the Retail and Business Solutions Divisions. The CompuCom Division generally does not experience notable seasonality. Certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles. Business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods.
Intellectual Property
 We currently operate under the brand names Office Depot®, OfficeMax®, CompuCom®, Grand & Toy®, as well as others. We hold trademark registrations domestically and worldwide and have numerous other applications pending worldwide for the names “Office Depot,” “OfficeMax,” “Workonomy”, “TUL,” “Ativa,” “Foray,” “Realspace,” “WorkPro,” “Brenton Studio,” “Highmark” and others. As with all domestic trademarks, our trademark registrations in the United States are for a ten-year period and are renewable prior to their respective expirations, as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We also hold issued patents and pending patent applications domestically for certain private brand products, such as shredders, office chairs and writing instruments.

Industry and Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our Business Solutions and Retail Divisions compete with office supply stores, wholesale clubs, discount stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers, food and drug stores, computer and electronics superstores and direct marketing companies. These companies compete with us in substantially all of our current markets. Increased competition in the office products markets, together with increased advertising, and internet-based search tools, has heightened price awareness among end-users. Such heightened price awareness has led to sales and margin pressure on our sales of office products and has negatively impacted our results. In addition to price, we also compete based on customer service, the quality and extent of product selection and convenience. Other office supply retail companies market similarly to us in terms of store format, pricing strategy, product selection and product availability in the markets where we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources, which provide them with greater purchasing power, increased financial flexibility and more capital resources for expansion and improvement, which may enable them to compete more effectively. We anticipate that in the future we will continue to face high levels of competition from these companies.
 We believe our robust field sales forces, dedicated customer service associates and the efficiency and convenience for our customers from our combined contract and direct sales distribution channels position our Business Solutions Division well to compete with other business-to-business office products distributors.
 We believe our Retail Division competes favorably against competitors based on convenience, location, the quality of our customer service, our store layouts, the range and depth of our merchandise offering and our pricing.
 The CompuCom Division operates in an environment that is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting client needs and expectations. We compete with companies that provide IT services and outsourcing, as well as companies that sell IT related products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, a breadth of service offerings to provide one-stop solutions to clients, a well-developed recruiting, training and retention model, responsiveness to clients’ business needs, and quality of services. We believe our CompuCom Division successfully competes based on the quality of our customer service, the range and depth of our merchandise offering and our pricing.
 Employees
 As of January 26, 2019, we had approximately 44,000 employees.
 Environmental Matters
 As both a significant user and seller of paper products, we have developed environmental practices that are values-based and market-driven. Our environmental initiatives center on three guiding principles: (1) recycling and pollution reduction; (2) sustainable forest management; and (3) issue awareness and market development for environmentally preferable products. We offer thousands of different products containing recycled content and technology recycling services.
 Office Depot continues to implement environmental programs in line with our stated environmental vision to “increasingly buy green, be green and sell green” — including environmental sensitivity in our packaging, operations and sales offerings. We have been commended for our leadership position for our facility design, recycling efforts, and ‘green’ product offerings. Additional information on our green product offerings can be found at www.officedepot.com/buygreen.
 We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations related to historical OfficeMax operations of paper and forest products businesses and timberland assets. We record environmental and asbestos liabilities, and accrue losses associated with these obligations, when probable and reasonably estimable. We record a separate insurance recovery receivable when considered probable. Refer to Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.
