About Us
 
General
 
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. (“CCBG”) is a financial holding company headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida. CCBG was incorporated under Florida law on December 13, 1982, to acquire five national banks and one state bank that all subsequently became part of CCBG’s bank subsidiary, Capital City Bank (“CCB” or the “Bank”). The Bank commenced operations in 1895. In this report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean CCBG and all subsidiaries included in our consolidated financial statements.
 We provide traditional deposit and credit services, asset management, trust, mortgage banking, merchant services, bank cards, data processing, and securities brokerage services through 59 banking offices in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama operated by CCB. The majority of our revenue, approximately 88%, is derived from our Florida market areas while approximately 11% and 1% of our revenue is derived from our Georgia and Alabama market areas, respectively.
 Below is a summary of our financial condition and results of operations for the past three years.  Our financial condition and results of operations are more fully discussed in our management discussion and analysis on page 32 and our consolidated financial statements on page 64.

Dividends and management fees received from the Bank are CCBG’s primary source of income. Dividend payments by the Bank to CCBG depend on the capitalization, earnings and projected growth of the Bank, and are limited by various regulatory restrictions, including compliance with a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital conservation buffer.  See the section entitled “Regulatory Matters” in this Item 1 and Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the restrictions.
 
We had a total of 819 associates at March 1, 2019.  Item 6 contains other financial and statistical information about us.

We are not an affiliate of LPL Financial.
Underwriting Standards
 One of our core goals is to support the communities in which we operate. We seek loans from within our primary market area, which is defined as the counties in which our banking offices are located.  We will also originate loans within our secondary market area, defined as counties adjacent to those in which we have banking offices.  There may also be occasions when we will have opportunities to make loans that are out of both the primary and secondary market areas, including participation loans. These loans are generally only approved if the applicant is known to us, underwriting is consistent with our criteria, and the applicant’s primary business is in or near our primary or secondary market area. Approval of all loans is subject to our policies and standards described in more detail below.
 
We have adopted comprehensive lending policies, underwriting standards and loan review procedures. Management and our Board of Directors reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis (at least annually).
 
 5

  
Management has also implemented reporting systems designed to monitor loan originations, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, nonperforming loans, and potential problem loans. Our management and the Credit Risk Oversight Committee periodically review our lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies. In addition, total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored. As part of this process, the overall composition of the portfolio is reviewed to gauge diversification of risk, client concentrations, industry group, loan type, geographic area, or other relevant classifications of loans.  Specific segments of the portfolio are monitored and reported to our Board on a quarterly basis and we have strategic plans in place to supplement Board approved credit policies governing exposure limits and underwriting standards. We recognize that exceptions to the below-listed policy guidelines may occasionally occur and has established procedures for approving exceptions to these policy guidelines.
 
Residential Real Estate Loans 
 
We originate 1-4 family, owner-occupied residential real estate loans in its Residential Real Estate line of business. Our policy is to underwrite these loans in accordance with secondary market guidelines in effect at the time of origination, including loan-to-value (“LTV”) and documentation requirements. We originate fixed-rate, adjustable-rate and variable- rate residential real estate loans. Over the past five years, the vast majority of residential loan originations have been fixed-rate loans which are sold in the secondary market on a non-recourse basis with related servicing rights (i.e., we generally do not service sold loans).  Adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans with an initial fixed interest rate period greater than five years are also sold in the secondary market on a non-recourse basis. 
 
We also originate certain residential real estate loans throughout our banking office network that are generally not eligible for sale into the secondary market due to not meeting a specific secondary market underwriting requirement. This includes our variable rate 3/1 and 5/1 ARM loans which typically have a maximum term of 30 years and maximum LTV of 80%.
 
Residential real estate loans also include home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and home equity loans. Our home equity portfolio includes revolving open-ended equity loans with interest-only or minimal monthly principal payments and closed-end amortizing loans. Open-ended equity loans typically have an interest only 10-year draw period followed by a five year repayment period of 0.75% of principal balance monthly and balloon payment at maturity.  As of December 31, 2018, approximately 66% of our residential home equity loan portfolio consisted of first mortgages.  Interest rates may be fixed or adjustable.  Adjustable-rate loans are tied to the Prime Rate with a typical margin of 1.0% or more.
 
Commercial Loans
 
Our policy sets forth guidelines for debt service coverage ratios, LTV ratios and documentation standards. Commercial loans are primarily made based on identified cash flows of the borrower with consideration given to underlying collateral and personal or other guarantees. We have established debt service coverage ratio limits that require a borrower’s cash flow to be sufficient to cover principal and interest payments on all new and existing debt. The majority of our commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory.  Many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable interest rates tied to the Prime Rate or U.S. Treasury indices.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
We have adopted guidelines for debt service coverage ratios, LTV ratios and documentation standards for commercial real estate loans. These loans are primarily made based on identified cash flows of the borrower with consideration given to underlying real estate collateral and personal guarantees. Our policy establishes a maximum LTV specific to property type and minimum debt service coverage ratio limits that require a borrower’s cash flow to be sufficient to cover principal and interest payments on all new and existing debt. Commercial real estate loans may be fixed or variable-rate loans with interest rates tied to the Prime Rate or U.S. Treasury indices. We require appraisals for loans in excess of $250,000 that are secured by real property. 
Consumer Loans
 
Our consumer loan portfolio includes personal installment loans, direct and indirect automobile financing, and overdraft lines of credit. The majority of the consumer loan portfolio consists of indirect and direct automobile loans. The majority of our consumer loans are short-term and have fixed rates of interest that are priced based on current market interest rates and the financial strength of the borrower. Our policy establishes maximum debt-to-income ratios, minimum credit scores, and includes guidelines for verification of applicants’ income and receipt of credit reports.

Lending Limits and Extensions of Additional Credit
 
We have established an internal lending limit of $10 million for the total aggregate amount of credit that will be extended to a client and any related entities within our Board approved policies. This compares to our legal lending limit of approximately $86  million. 
Loan Modification and Restructuring
 
In the normal course of business, we receive requests from our clients to renew, extend, refinance, or otherwise modify their current loan obligations. In most cases, this may be the result of a balloon maturity that is common in most commercial loan agreements, a request to refinance to obtain current market rates of interest, competitive reasons, or the conversion of a construction loan to a permanent financing structure at the completion or stabilization of the property. In these cases, the request is held to the normal underwriting standards and pricing strategies as any other loan request, whether new or renewal.
 
In other cases, we may modify a loan because of a reduction in debt service capacity experienced by the client (i.e., a potentially troubled loan whereby the client may be experiencing financial difficulties). To maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt.
 
Expansion of Business
 
Our philosophy is to build long-term client relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards, and safe and sound banking practices.  We maintain a locally oriented, community-based focus, which is augmented by experienced, centralized support in select specialized areas.  Our local market orientation is reflected in our network of banking office locations, experienced community executives with a dedicated President for each market, and community boards which support our focus on responding to local banking needs.  We strive to offer a broad array of sophisticated products and to provide quality service by empowering associates to make decisions in their local markets.
 
We have sought to build a franchise in small-to medium-sized, less competitive markets, located on the outskirts of the larger metropolitan markets where we are positioned as a market leader.  Many of our markets are on the outskirts of these larger markets in close proximity to major interstate thoroughfares such as Interstates I-10 and I-75.  Our three largest markets are Tallahassee (Leon County, Florida), Gainesville (Alachua County, Florida), and Macon (Bibb County, Georgia).  In 13 of 18 markets in Florida and two of four markets in Georgia, we rank within the top four banks in terms of market share.  Furthermore, in the counties in which we operate, we maintain a 8.30% market share in the Florida counties and 5.11% in the Georgia counties, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to grow market share within these geographic areas.  The larger employers in many of our markets are state and local governments, healthcare providers, educational institutions, and small businesses.  While we realize that the markets in our footprint do not provide for a level of potential growth that the larger metropolitan markets may provide, our markets do provide good growth dynamics and have historically grown in excess of the national average  The value of these markets stems from the fact they are stable and less competitive, secondary markets.  We strive to provide value added services to our clients by being not just their bank, but their banker.  This element of our strategy distinguishes Capital City Bank from our competitors.           
 
Our long-term vision remains to profitably expand our franchise through a combination of organic growth in existing markets and acquisitions.  We have long understood that our core deposit funding base is a predominant driver of our profitability and overall franchise value, and have focused extensively on this component of our organic growth efforts in recent years.  While we have not been an active acquirer of banks since 2005, this component of our strategy is still in place.  When evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, we will continue to weigh the value of organic growth initiatives versus potential acquisition returns and pursue the strategies that we believe provide the best overall return to our shareowners.
 
 7

  
Potential acquisition opportunities will continue to be focused on Florida, Georgia, and Alabama with a particular focus on financial institutions located on the outskirts of larger, metropolitan areas.  Five markets have been identified, four in Florida and one in Georgia, in which management intends to proactively pursue expansion opportunities.  These markets include Alachua, Marion, Hernando/Pasco counties in Florida, the western panhandle of Florida, and Bibb and surrounding counties in central Georgia.  Our focus on some of these markets may change as we continue to evaluate our strategy and the economic conditions and demographics of any individual market.  We will also continue to evaluate de novo expansion opportunities in attractive new markets in the event that acquisition opportunities are not feasible.  Other expansion opportunities that will be evaluated include asset management, mortgage banking, and other financial businesses that are closely aligned with the business of banking.  Embedded in our acquisition strategy is our desire to partner with institutions that are culturally similar, have experienced management and possess either established market presence or have potential for improved profitability through growth, economies of scale, or expanded services.  Generally, these target institutions will range in asset size from $100 million to $500 million.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment, especially with respect to services and pricing, that has undergone significant changes since the recent financial crisis. Since January 1, 2009, over 500 financial institutions have failed in the U.S., including 85 in Georgia and 70 in Florida. Nearly all of the failed banks were community banks. The assets and deposits of many of these failed community banks were acquired mostly by larger financial institutions.  The banking industry has also experienced significant consolidation through mergers and acquisition, which we expect will continue during 2019.  However, we believe that the larger financial institutions acquiring banks in our market areas are less familiar with the markets in which we operate and typically target a different client base. We also believe clients who bank at community banks tend to prefer the relationship style service of community banks compared to larger banks.
 
As a result, we expect to be able to effectively compete in our markets with larger financial institutions through providing superior customer service and leveraging our knowledge and experience in providing banking products and services in our market areas. Thus, a further reduction of the number of community banks could continue to enhance our competitive position and opportunities in many of our markets. However, larger financial institutions can benefit from economies of scale, so these larger institutions may be able to offer banking products and services at more competitive price. Additionally, these larger financial institutions may offer financial products that we do not offer.
 
We may also begin to see competition from new banks that are being formed. In late 2016, the first de novo bank charter since the downturn was approved for a Florida-based bank and three additional Florida charters were approved in 2018. While the number of new bank formations has not returned to pre-downturn levels, increased de novo bank applications could signal additional competition from new community banks.
 
Our primary market area consists of 18 counties in Florida, four counties in Georgia, and one county in Alabama. In these markets, we compete against a wide range of banking and nonbanking institutions including banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, money market funds, mutual fund advisory companies, mortgage banking companies, investment banking companies, finance companies and other types of financial institutions. Most of Florida’s major banking concerns have a presence in Leon County, where our main office is located.  Our Leon County deposits totaled $983 million, or 39% of our consolidated deposits at December 31, 2018.

Seasonality
 
We believe our commercial banking operations are not generally seasonal in nature; however, public deposits tend to increase with tax collections in the fourth and first quarters of each year and decline as a result of governmental spending thereafter.

Regulatory Considerations
 We must comply with state and federal banking laws and regulations that control virtually all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations generally aim to protect our depositors, not necessarily our shareowners or our creditors. Any changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially affect our business and prospects. Proposed legislative or regulatory changes may also affect our operations. The following description summarizes some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject. References to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. 
Capital City Bank Group, Inc.
 
We are registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As a result, we are subject to supervisory regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Bank Holding Company Act, and other federal laws subject financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. 
Permitted Activities
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act modernized the U.S. banking system by: (i) allowing bank holding companies that qualify as “financial holding companies,” such as CCBG, to engage in a broad range of financial and related activities; (ii) allowing insurers and other financial service companies to acquire banks; (iii) removing restrictions that applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and (iv) establishing the overall regulatory scheme applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. The general effect of the law was to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial service providers. Activities that are financial in nature are broadly defined to include not only banking, insurance, and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activities, or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. 
 
In contrast to financial holding companies, bank holding companies are limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Possible benefits include greater convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency. Possible adverse effects include undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity.
 
Changes in Control
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank or bank holding company. A conclusive presumption of control exists if an individual or company acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution. A rebuttable presumption of control exists if a person or company acquires 10% or more but less than 25% of any class of voting securities of an insured depository institution and either the institution has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which we will refer to as the Exchange Act, or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the acquisition. Our common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. 
 
The Federal Reserve Board maintains a policy statement on minority equity investments in banks and bank holding companies, that generally permits investors to (i) acquire up to 33% of the total equity of a target bank or bank holding company, subject to certain conditions, including (but not limited to) that the investing firm does not acquire 15% or more of any class of voting securities, and (ii) designate at least one director, without triggering the various regulatory requirements associated with control.
 
 11

  
As a financial holding company, we are required to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank or bank holding company, (ii) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless we own a majority of such bank’s voting shares), or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank or bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring institution’s record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves, including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank, under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. 
 
Under Florida law, a person or entity proposing to directly or indirectly acquire control of a Florida bank must also obtain permission from the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. Florida statutes define “control” as either (i) indirectly or directly owning, controlling or having power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of a bank; (ii) controlling the election of a majority of directors of a bank; (iii) owning, controlling, or having power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities as well as directly or indirectly exercising a controlling influence over management or policies of a bank; or (iv) as determined by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. These requirements will affect us because CCB is chartered under Florida law and changes in control of CCBG are indirect changes in control of CCB.
 
Tying
 
Financial holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extending credit, to other services or products offered by the holding company or its affiliates, such as deposit products.
Capital; Dividends; Source of Strength
 
The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on financial holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of “qualifying” capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are described below under “Capital Regulations.” Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, we are generally able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to CCB, and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid from CCB to us. We are also able to raise capital for contributions to CCB by issuing securities without having to receive regulatory approval, subject to compliance with federal and state securities laws.
 
In accordance with Federal Reserve policy, which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to CCB and to commit resources to support CCB in circumstances in which we might not otherwise do so. In furtherance of this policy, the Federal Reserve may require a financial holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the financial holding company. Further, federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a financial holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition. 
 
Capital City Bank
 
Capital City Bank is a state-chartered commercial banking institution that is chartered by and headquartered in the State of Florida, and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. The Florida Office of Financial Regulation supervises and regulates all areas of our operations including, without limitation, the making of loans, the issuance of securities, the conduct of our corporate affairs, the satisfaction of capital adequacy requirements, the payment of dividends, and the establishment or closing of banking centers. We are also a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, which makes our operations subject to broad federal regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve. In addition, our deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the FDIC has certain enforcement powers over us. 
 
As a state-chartered bank in the State of Florida, we are empowered by statute, subject to the limitations contained in those statutes, to take and pay interest on, savings and time deposits, to accept demand deposits, to make loans on residential and other real estate, to make consumer and commercial loans, to invest, with certain limitations, in equity securities and in debt obligations of banks and corporations and to provide various other banking services for the benefit of our clients. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect our operations, including state usury laws, laws relating to fiduciaries, consumer credit and equal credit opportunity laws, and fair credit reporting. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) prohibits insured state chartered institutions from conducting activities as principal that are not permitted for national banks. A bank, however, may engage in an otherwise prohibited activity if it meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.

Reserves
 
The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against transaction accounts (noninterest bearing and NOW checking accounts). The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements. An institution may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank “discount window” as a secondary source of funds, provided that the institution meets the Federal Reserve Bank’s credit standards.
Dividends
 
CCB is subject to legal limitations on the frequency and amount of dividends that can be paid to CCBG. The Federal Reserve may restrict the ability of CCB to pay dividends if such payments would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Additionally, as of January 1, 2019, financial institutions are being required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and other payments. If a financial institution’s capital conservation buffer falls below the minimum requirement, its maximum payout amount for capital distributions and discretionary payments declines to a set percentage of eligible retained income based on the size of the buffer. See “Capital Regulations,” below for additional details on this new capital requirement.
 
In addition, Florida law and Federal regulation also places restrictions on the declaration of dividends from state chartered banks to their holding companies. Pursuant to the Florida Financial Institutions Code, the board of directors of state-chartered banks, after charging off bad debts, depreciation and other worthless assets, if any, and making provisions for reasonably anticipated future losses on loans and other assets, may quarterly, semi-annually or annually declare a dividend of up to the aggregate net profits of that period combined with the bank’s retained net profits for the preceding two years and, with the approval of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and Federal Reserve, declare a dividend from retained net profits which accrued prior to the preceding two years. Before declaring such dividends, 20% of the net profits for the preceding period as is covered by the dividend must be transferred to the surplus fund of the bank until this fund becomes equal to the amount of the bank’s common stock then issued and outstanding. A state-chartered bank may not declare any dividend if (i) its net income (loss) from the current year combined with the retained net income (loss) for the preceding two years aggregates a loss or (ii) the payment of such dividend would cause the capital account of the bank to fall below the minimum amount required by law, regulation, order or any written agreement with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation or a federal regulatory agency.
 
Insurance of Accounts and Other Assessments 
 
Our deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. We pay deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which are determined through a risk-based assessment system. 
 
Under the current system, deposit insurance assessments are based on a bank’s assessment base, which is defined as average total assets minus average tangible equity.  The FDIC assigns an institution to one of two categories based on asset size.  We fall into the Established Small Institution category.  This category has three sub categories based on supervisory ratings (its “CAMELS ratings”) designed to measure risk.  In determining the applicable assessment rate, the initial base assessment is determined based on the risk-based sub category into which the bank falls. The applicable sub category is determined based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations. The total base assessment rate is then determined by adjusting the initial base assessment rate by an unsecured debt adjustment and brokered deposit adjustment, if applicable, and the deposit insurance assessment is calculated by multiplying the bank’s assessment base by the total base assessment rate.
 
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The Financing Corporation assessment rate is adjusted quarterly (currently less than 1 basis points for the first quarter of 2019) to reflect changes in the assessment base as determined from the quarterly Call Report submissions. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019.
 
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Transactions With Affiliates
 
Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the authority of CCB to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” or to make loans to insiders is limited. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between CCB and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to CCB, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, CCB generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates. 
 
Loans to executive officers, directors or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls or has the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank, which we refer to as “10% Shareowners,” or to any political or campaign committee the funds or services of which will benefit those executive officers, directors, or 10% Shareowners or which is controlled by those executive officers, directors or 10% Shareowners, are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and their corresponding regulations (Regulation O) and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act relating to the prohibition on personal loans to executives (which exempts financial institutions in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act). Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire board of directors. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds 15% of an institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed our unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) identifies limited circumstances in which we are permitted to extend credit to executive officers. 
 
Community Reinvestment Act
 
The Community Reinvestment Act and its corresponding regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. These regulations provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of its market area. Federal banking agencies are required to publicly disclose each bank’s rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. The Federal Reserve considers a bank’s Community Reinvestment Act rating when the bank submits an application to establish bank branches, merge with another bank, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of a financial holding company, the Community Reinvestment Act performance record of all banks involved in a merger or acquisition are reviewed in connection with the application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with another bank or bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction. We received a satisfactory rating on our most recent Community Reinvestment Act assessment. 
Capital Regulations
 
The federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based, capital adequacy guidelines for financial holding companies and their subsidiary banks based on the Basel III standards, which became effective January 1, 2015 for community banks. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to specific risk categories each with designated risk weightings. The new risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles of banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets, and to achieve greater consistency in evaluating the capital adequacy of major banks throughout the world. The resulting capital ratios include ratios that represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. 
 
In computing total risk-weighted assets, bank and bank holding company assets are assigned risk-weights of 0%, 20%, 50%, 100% and 150%. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are assigned credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk-weight applied. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category, except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by 1- to 4-family and certain multi-family residential property, which carry a 50% risk rating. Most investment securities (including, general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the United States) are assigned to the 20% category, except for municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk-weight, and direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which have a 0% risk-weight. In covering off-balance sheet items, direct credit substitutes, including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations, are assigned a 100% conversion factor. Transaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds, standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial obligations, and undrawn commitments (including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year) have a 50% conversion factor. Short-term commercial letters of credit are converted at 20% and certain short-term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a 0% factor.

Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quality and quantity of capital held by banking organizations. In this respect, the final rules implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and improved the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. Consistent with the international Basel III framework, the rules include a new minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets of 4.5% and a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets from 4% to 6% and include a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% each of the next three years until January 1, 2019, when the full 2.5% capital conversion buffer was fully phased in. If a financial institution’s capital conservation buffer falls below the minimum, capital distributions and discretionary payments could be limited or prohibited.  The types of payments subject to this limitation include dividends, share buybacks, discretionary payments on Tier 1 instruments, and discretionary bonus payments.
 
The new capital regulations also impacted the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) for regulatory capital purposes. Under the new rules, AOCI generally flows through to regulatory capital, however, community banks and their holding companies were permitted to make a one-time irrevocable opt-out election to continue to treat AOCI the same as under the old regulations for regulatory capital purposes.  We elected to opt-out in 2015.  Additionally, community banks with less than $15 billion in total assets could continue to count certain non-qualifying capital instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 as Tier 1 capital, including trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock (subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital). However, non-qualifying capital instruments issued on or after May 19, 2010 do not qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment.
 
Federal law and regulations also establish a capital-based regulatory scheme designed to promote early intervention for troubled banks and require the FDIC to choose the least expensive resolution of bank failures. The capital-based regulatory framework contains five categories of compliance with regulatory capital requirements, including “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” To qualify as a “well-capitalized” institution, a bank must have a leverage ratio of not less than 5%, a Tier 1 Common Equity ratio of not less than 6.5%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of not less than 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 10%, and the bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level.
 
A bank regulatory agency can treat an institution as if it were in the next lower category if the agency determines that the institution is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The degree of regulatory scrutiny of a financial institution will increase, and the permissible activities of the institution will decrease, as it moves downward through the capital categories. Institutions that fall into one of the three undercapitalized categories may be required to (i) submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) raise additional capital; (iii) restrict their growth, deposit interest rates, and other activities; (iv) improve their management; (v) eliminate management fees; or (vi) divest all or a part of their operations. It should be noted that the minimum ratios referred to above are merely guidelines and the bank regulators may require higher capital ratios at their discretion.
 
At December 31, 2018, we exceeded the requirements to be classified as “well capitalized” and are unaware of any material violation or alleged violation of these regulations, policies or directives (see table below). Rapid growth, poor loan portfolio performance, or poor earnings performance, or a combination of these factors, could change our capital position in a relatively short period of time, making additional capital infusions necessary.  The capital ratios can be found in Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions.

Interstate Banking and Branching
 
The Bank Holding Company Act permits adequately capitalized and managed financial and bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state and state laws prohibiting interstate banking or discriminating against out-of-state banks are generally preempted. However, states are permitted to adopt a minimum age restriction requiring that target banks located within the state be in existence for a period of time, up to a maximum of five years, before a bank may be acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Also, the Dodd-Frank Act, added deposit caps, which prohibit acquisitions that would result in the acquiring company controlling 30% or more of the deposits of insured banks and thrift institutions held in the state in which the target maintains a branch or 10% or more of the deposits nationwide. States have the authority to waive the 30% deposit cap. State-level deposit caps are not preempted as long as they do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions, and the federal deposit caps apply only to initial entry acquisitions.
 
As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. Florida law permits a state bank to establish a branch of the bank anywhere in the state. Accordingly, a bank with its headquarters outside the State of Florida may establish branches anywhere within the state. 
 
Anti-money Laundering
 
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”), provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), the USA PATRIOT Act puts in place measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. In addition, certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions.
 
The USA PATRIOT Act and the related Federal Reserve regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum:
 
·         internal policies, procedures and controls designed to implement and maintain the savings association’s compliance with all of the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, the BSA and related laws and regulations;
 ·         systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions and activities;
 ·         a designated compliance officer;
 ·         employee training;
 ·         an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program;
 ·         procedures to verify the identity of each client upon the opening of accounts; and
 ·         heightened due diligence policies, procedures and controls applicable to certain foreign accounts and relationships.
 
Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program (“CIP”) as part of its anti-money laundering program. The key components of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods. Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or suspected terrorists. On May 11, 2018, the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule under the BSA requiring banks to identify and verify the identity of the natural persons behind their customers that are legal entities – the beneficial owners.  We and our affiliates have adopted policies, procedures and controls designed to comply with the BSA and the USA PATRIOT Act.
 
Regulatory Enforcement Authority
 
Federal and state banking laws grant substantial regulatory authority and enforcement powers to federal and state banking regulators. This authority permits bank regulatory agencies to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for either violations of laws or regulations or for unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.

Federal Home Loan Bank System
 
CCB is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each FHLB serves as a quasi-reserve bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. A FHLB makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of trustees of the FHLB.
 
As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, CCB is required to own capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to 0.09% (or 9 basis points), which is subject to annual adjustments, of CCB’s total assets at the end of each calendar year (up to a maximum of $15 million), plus 4.25% of its outstanding advances (borrowings) from the FHLB of Atlanta under the activity-based stock ownership requirement. As of December 31, 2018, CCB was in compliance with this requirement.
 
Privacy
 
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties.
Overdraft Fee Regulation
 
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines (“ATM”) and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those type of transactions.  If a consumer does not opt in, any ATM transaction or debit that overdraws the consumer’s account will be denied.  Overdrafts on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments are not covered by this new rule.  Before opting in, the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service, and the consumer’s choices.  Financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms, conditions and features (including pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in. 
Consumer Laws and Regulations
 
CCB is also subject to other federal and state consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. CCB must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations. 
 
In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws that affect our consumer businesses. These include regulations setting “ability to repay” standards for residential mortgage loans and mortgage loan servicing and originator compensation standards, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for loans that meet the requirements of the “qualified mortgage” safe harbor. Also, in 2015, the new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (“TRID”) rules for mortgage closings took effect for new loan applications. The new TRID rules were further amended in 2017. These new rules, including the new required loan forms, have generally increased the time it takes to approve mortgage loans.
 
Future Legislative Developments
 
Various legislative acts are from time to time introduced in Congress and the Florida legislature. This legislation may change banking statutes and the environment in which our banking subsidiary and we operate in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations with respect thereto, would have upon our financial condition or results of operations or that of our banking subsidiary.

Current Expected Credit Loss Accounting Standard
 
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new current expected credit loss rule (“CECL”) which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, compared to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred. The update also amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and financial assets purchased with credit deterioration. The accounting standard change will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2020. The change in accounting standards could result in an increase in our reserve for loan losses and will require us to book loan losses sooner than under the current requirements. We are taking the necessary steps to be in compliance with the CECL accounting standard which we expect will become a critical accounting policy.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
 
The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing, availability of borrowing at the “discount window,” open market operations, changes in the Fed Funds target interest rate, changes in interest rates payable on member banks’ reserve accounts, the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and assets of foreign banking centers and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve. These monetary policies are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments and deposits, which may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The Federal Reserve’s policies are primarily influenced by its dual mandate of price stability and full employment, and to a lesser degree by short-term and long-term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the U.S. Government. Future changes in monetary policy and the effect of such changes on our business and earnings in the future cannot be predicted.
Income Taxes
 
We are subject to income taxes at the federal level and subject to state taxation based on the laws of each state in which we operate.  We file a consolidated federal tax return with a fiscal year ending on December 31. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation known as the H.R.1, commonly referred to as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” resulting in significant modifications to existing law. We completed the accounting for the effects of the new law during this period. Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflected certain effects of the new law, which included a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes. As a result of the changes to tax laws and tax rates under the Act, we incurred an increase in income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, due to a write-down of our net deferred tax asset by $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate. While the new tax law negatively impacted earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017, the lower corporate tax rate is expected to be a significant ongoing benefit to us in future periods. Absent future discrete events, we anticipate that our effective tax in future periods will be approximately 24% due to a lower federal corporate income tax rate.
