ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
 
Saker Aviation Services, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a Nevada corporation. Our common stock, $0.03 par value per share (the “common stock”), is quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace (“OTCQB”) under the symbol “SKAS”. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in the aviation services segment of the general aviation industry, in which we serve as the operator of a heliport, a fixed base operation (“FBO”), a provider of aircraft maintenance and repair services (“MRO”), and as a consultant for a seaplane base that we do not own. FBOs provide ground-based services, such as fueling and aircraft storage for general aviation, commercial and military aircraft, and other miscellaneous services.
 
We were formed on January 17, 2003 as a proprietorship and were incorporated in Arizona on January 2, 2004. We became a public company as a result of a reverse merger transaction on August 20, 2004 with Shadows Bend Development, Inc., an inactive public Nevada corporation, and subsequently changed our name to FBO Air, Inc. On December 12, 2006, we changed our name to FirstFlight, Inc. On September 2, 2009, we changed our name to Saker Aviation Services, Inc.
 
Our business activities are carried out as the operator of the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport, as an FBO and MRO at the Garden City (Kansas) Regional Airport, and as a consultant to the operator of a seaplane base in New York City.
 
The Garden City facility became part of our company as a result of our acquisition of the FBO assets of Central Plains Aviation, Inc. in March 2005 and of Aircraft Services, Inc. (“Aircraft Services”) in October 2016.
 
Our business activities at the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport facility (the “Heliport”) commenced in July 2008 when we were awarded the Concession Agreement by the City of New York to operate the Heliport, which we assigned to our subsidiary, FirstFlight Heliports, LLC d/b/a Saker Aviation Services (“FFH”).
 
We believe the general aviation market has been historically cyclical, with revenue correlated to general U.S. economic conditions. Although not truly seasonal in nature, the spring and summer months tend to generate higher levels of revenue and our operations generally follow that trend.
 
Suppliers and Raw Materials

Our principal materials are aviation fuel and aircraft parts. We obtain aviation fuel, component parts and other supplies from a variety of sources, generally from more than one supplier. Our suppliers and sources are both domestic and foreign, and we believe that our sources of materials are adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not believe the loss of any one supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We generally purchase our supplies on the open market, where certain commodities have fluctuated in price significantly in recent years. We have not experienced any significant shortage of our key supplies.
Marketing and Sales
 
The main goal of our marketing and sales efforts is to increase traffic at our facilities, which would then drive revenue through the incremental sale of our products and services. Our primary marketing tactic in this regard is to focus advertising efforts in the environments (web, periodical and industry publications) where the pilot and aviation-user community might be introduced to our brand name and locations. We intend to continue to invest in improvements to our sales and marketing strategies to drive revenue growth.

Government Approvals 
 
The aviation services that we provide are generally performed on municipal or other government owned real estate properties. Accordingly, at times we will need to obtain certain consents or approvals from governmental entities in conjunction with our operations. These consents and approvals are typically in the form of a lease agreement, as is the case at our Kansas facility, or a concession agreement, as is the case with our New York facility. There can be no assurance that we will obtain further consents or approvals on favorable terms or be able to renew existing consents or approvals on favorable terms, if at all.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that apply to companies in the aviation industry. These include compliance with the Federal Aviation Administration rules and regulations, and local, regional and national rules and regulations as they relate to environmental matters. We believe we are in compliance with, and intend to continue to comply with, all applicable government regulations. The adoption of new regulations could result in increased costs and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In the event we are unable to remain compliant with applicable rules and regulations, our business may be adversely affected.
Customers
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, four customers represented approximately 59.7% of our revenue. The loss of any of these four customers could represent a significant decrease in revenue that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, these four accounts represented approximately 71.0% of the balance of accounts receivable at December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts and are periodically evaluated for collectability. We depend significantly on our business with these four customers.
Competition
 
The FBO segment of the aviation services industry is competitive in both pricing and service because aircraft in transit are able to choose from a number of FBO options within a 300-mile radius. The vast majority of FBO operators are independent, single location operators. We are the sole FBO at our facility in Garden City, KS. As such, we face no direct on-airport competition. However, we face competitive pressure on pricing and services from FBO facilities at other airports, depending on aircraft travel flexibility.
 
We plan to grow our business through both internal development of existing resources and facilities and through the potential acquisition of other related business. We anticipate that growing our business will provide us with greater buying power from suppliers and, therefore, result in lower costs. Lower costs would allow us to implement a more aggressive pricing policy against some competitors. We believe that the higher level of customer service offered in our facilities will allow us to draw additional aircraft traffic and thus compete successfully against other FBOs of all sizes. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive aviation industry.
 
Costs and Effects of Complying With Environmental Laws
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those that govern health and safety requirements, the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the responsibility to investigate and clean up contaminated sites that are or were owned, leased, operated or used by us or our predecessors. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, which contain terms and conditions that impose limitations on our ability to emit and discharge hazardous materials into the environment and may be periodically subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. We intend to comply with these laws and regulations. However, from time to time, our operations may not be in full compliance with the terms and conditions of our permits or licenses. We periodically review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws and requirements. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and requirements and that any potential non-compliance would not be expected to result in us incurring material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Although the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and requirements has not been material, we can provide no assurance that such cost will not become material in the future.
