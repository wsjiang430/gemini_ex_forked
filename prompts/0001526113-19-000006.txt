Item 1. Business.
Overview
We were incorporated on July 13, 2011 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We completed our initial public offering on June 30, 2014 and, on June 2, 2015, we listed our Common Stock on the NYSE under the symbol "GNL." 
We invest in commercial properties, with an emphasis on sale-leaseback transactions involving single tenant net-leased commercial properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the Global Net Lease Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "OP"). Our properties are managed and leased to third parties by Global Net Lease Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager"). Pursuant to our advisory agreement with the Advisor, we have retained the Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. The Advisor and the Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, and these related parties receive compensation and fees for various services provided to us. 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 342 properties consisting of 27.5 million rentable square feet, which were 99.2% leased, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.3 years. Based on the percentage of annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2018, 55.7% of our properties are located in the United States ("U.S.") and 44.3% in Europe. We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans, preferred equity or securitized loans (secured by real estate). As of December 31, 2018, we did not own any first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans.
Following the termination of Moor Park Capital Partners LLP (the "Former Service Provider"), effective as of March 17, 2018, the Advisor, together with its service providers, assumed full management responsibility of our European real estate portfolio. Prior to the termination of the Former Service Provider, the Former Service Provider provided, subject to the Advisor's oversight and pursuant to a service provider agreement (the “Service Provider Agreement”), certain real estate related services, as well as sourcing and structuring of investment opportunities, performance of due diligence, and arranging debt financing and equity investment syndicates, solely with respect to investments in Europe. Since the termination of the Former Service Provider, the Advisor has built a European-focused management team and engaged third-party service providers to assume certain duties previously performed by the Former Service Provider. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information.
Merger Transaction
On August 8, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with American Realty Capital Global Trust II, Inc. ("Global II"). We and Global II each are or were sponsored, directly or indirectly, by an affiliate of AR Global, which, through its affiliates, provide or provided asset management services to us and Global II pursuant to advisory agreements. On December 22, 2016 (the "Merger Date"), pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global II merged with and into Mayflower Acquisition LLC (the "Merger Sub"), a Maryland limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours, at which time the separate existence of Global II ceased and we became the parent of the Merger Sub (the "Merger"). In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, American Realty Capital Global II Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and the operating partnership of Global II (the "Global II OP"), merged with the OP, a Delaware limited partnership and our operating partnership, with the OP being the surviving entity (the "Partnership Merger" and together with the Merger, the "Mergers"). As a result of the Mergers, we acquired the business of Global II, which immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, owned a portfolio of commercial properties, including single tenant net-leased commercial properties, two of which were located in the U.S., three of which were located in the United Kingdom, and 10 of which were located in continental Europe (see Note 3 — Merger Transaction to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Common Stock Offerings
ATM Program — Common Stock
We have an “at the market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) pursuant to which we may sell shares of Common Stock, from time to time through our sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 820,988 shares of Common Stock through the ATM Program for gross sales proceeds of $18.7 million, before issuance costs of $0.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 164,927 shares of Common Stock through the ATM program for gross proceeds of $3.5 million, before commissions paid of $35,140 and additional issuance costs of $0.3 million. These costs are recorded in additional paid-in capital on the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets. 
During January 2019, we sold 7,759,322 shares of Common Stock through the ATM Program for gross proceeds of $152.8 million, before commissions of $1.5 million and additional issuance costs of $2,000. Following these sales, we had raised all $175.0 million contemplated by our existing equity distribution agreement related to the ATM Program and, in February 2019, we terminated our existing equity distribution agreement and entered into a new equity distribution agreement with substantially the same sales agents on substantially the same terms. The new equity distribution agreement provides for the continuation of our ATM Program to raise additional aggregate sales proceeds of up to $250.0 million. See Note 16 — Subsequent Events to our

consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Item 9B. Other Information” for further information.
Underwritten Offerings — Common Stock
On August 20, 2018, we completed the issuance and sale of 4,600,000 shares of Common Stock (including 600,000 shares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their option to purchase additional shares in full) in an underwritten public offering at a price per share of $20.65. The gross proceeds from this offering were $95.0 million before deducting the underwriting discount of $3.8 million and additional offering expenses of $0.3 million.
On November 28, 2018, we completed the issuance and sale of 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock in an underwritten public offering at a price per share of $20.20. The gross proceeds from this offering were $80.8 million before deducting the underwriting discount of $3.2 million and additional offering expenses of $0.1 million.
Preferred Stock Offerings
ATM Program — Series A Preferred Stock
In March 2018, we established an “at the market” equity offering program for our Series A Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock ATM Program") pursuant to which we may raise aggregate sales proceeds of $200.0 million through sales of shares of Series A Preferred Stock from time to time through our sales agents. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 7,240 shares of Series A Preferred Stock through the Preferred Stock ATM Program for gross proceeds of $0.2 million, before commissions paid of $2,724 and additional issuance costs of $0.4 million.
Underwritten Offerings — Series A Preferred Stock
On September 12, 2017, we completed the issuance and sale of 4,000,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price equal to the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, and, on October 11, 2017, we issued and sold an additional 259,650 shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the underwriters’ partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares in accordance with terms of the underwriting agreement. The gross proceeds from this offering were $106.5 million before deducting the underwriting discount of $3.4 million and additional offering expenses of $0.5 million.
On December 19, 2017, we completed the issuance and sale of 1,150,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (including 150,000 shares pursuant to the underwriter’s exercise of its option to purchase additional shares in full) in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price equal to the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The gross proceeds from this offering were $28.8 million before deducting the underwriting discount of $0.8 million and additional offering expenses of $0.2 million.
Investment Strategy
Our investment strategy is to own and acquire a portfolio of commercial properties that is diversified in terms of geography, industry, and tenants. Based on the percentage of annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2018, 55.7% of our properties are located in the U.S. and 44.3% in Europe. Based on annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2018, approximately 53% of our investments are in office properties, 39% of our investments are in industrial/distribution properties, and 8% of our investments are in retail properties. No individual tenant accounted for more than 10% of our annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
We seek to:

• | support a stable and consistent dividend by generating stable and consistent cash flows by acquiring properties with, or entering into new leases with, long lease terms;


• | facilitate dividend growth by acquiring properties with, or entering into new leases with, contractual rent escalations or inflation adjustments included in the lease terms; and


• | enhance the diversity of our asset base by continuously evaluating opportunities in different geographic regions of the U.S. and Europe and leveraging the market presence of the Advisor.

Acquisition and Investment Policies
Primary Investment Focus
We primarily focus on acquiring net lease properties with existing net leases, or we acquire properties pursuant to sale-leaseback transactions. We are in the business of acquiring real estate properties and leasing the properties to tenants. Our goal is to grow through acquiring additional properties. We have signed two non-binding letters of intent and one definitive purchase and sale agreement to acquire a total of three net lease properties, all of which are located in the United States, for an aggregate purchase price of $42.0 million. The two letters of intent may not lead to definitive agreements and the one definitive agreement is subject to conditions. There can be no assurance we will complete any of these acquisitions on their contemplated terms, or at all. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired 23 properties for $479.6 million, including capitalized acquisition costs. As part 
6

of our acquisition strategy, we intend to increase the percentage of our portfolio located in the U.S. to 60% and increase the percentage of our portfolio consisting of industrial/distribution properties which was 39.0% based on annualized straight-line rent as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 342 properties, including 273 properties located in the U.S., 43 properties located in the United Kingdom and 26 properties located across continental Europe.    
Investing in Real Property
When evaluating prospective investments in real property, our Advisor considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting it, the creditworthiness of its major tenants, its income producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. In this regard, the Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject to board approval and any guidelines established by our board of directors.
The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of leases by any major tenant may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
Other Investments 
We believe that the presence of the Advisor in the commercial real estate marketplace may present attractive opportunities to invest in properties other than long-term net leased properties, such as partially leased properties, multi-tenanted properties, vacant or undeveloped properties and properties subject to short-term net leases. We may in the future acquire or originate real estate debt such as first mortgage debt loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans secured by real estate. We may also invest in real estate-related securities issued by real estate market participants such as real estate funds or other REITs. Real estate-related securities include commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), preferred equity and other higher-yielding structured debt and equity investments. As of December 31, 2018, we do not own any of these types of investments.
Acquisition Structure 
We acquire properties through the OP and its subsidiaries. We have acquired properties through asset purchases and through purchases of the equity of entities owning properties. We typically acquire fee interests in a property (a “fee interest” is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although we have acquired 13 leasehold interest properties (a “leasehold interest” is a right to enjoy the exclusive possession and use of an asset or property for a stated definite period as created by a written lease).
We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments) for the purpose of making investments, provided these investments would not cause us to be required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Financing Strategies and Policies 
We have used financing for acquisitions and other investments, property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. We expect to obtain additional financing for similar purposes in the future. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2018, and based on the prevailing exchange rates on that date, our aggregate gross borrowings are equal to 49.3% of the purchase price of our real estate investments, or 54.0% of our total assets.
We may reevaluate and change our financing policies without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include among other things, current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, our expected investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements. 
Mortgage Notes Payable
We have various mortgage loans outstanding, which are secured by our properties. Our mortgage loans typically bear interest at margin plus a floating rate which is mostly fixed through interest rate swap agreements (see Note 5 — Mortgage Notes Payable, Net to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for mortgage loans in respective currency and interest rate detail).
Credit Facility
On July 24, 2017, we, through the OP, entered into a credit agreement with KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”), as agent, and the other lender parties thereto, which as of December 31, 2018 provides for a $632.0 million senior unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), and a €246.5 million ($286.8 million USD equivalent as of August 16, 2018) senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Loan” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facility”). 
7

The aggregate total commitments under the Credit Facility were $725.0 million based on USD equivalents at closing on July 24, 2017. On July 2, 2018, upon our request, the lenders under the Credit Facility increased the aggregate total commitments from $722.2 million to $914.4 million, based on the prevailing exchange rate on that date, with approximately $132.0 million of the increase allocated to the USD portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately €51.8 million ($60.2 million based on the prevailing exchange rate on that date) allocated to the Term Loan. We used the proceeds from the increased borrowings under the Term Loan to repay amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon our request, subject in all respects to the consent of the lenders in their sole discretion, the aggregate total commitments under the Credit Facility may be increased up to an aggregate additional amount of $35.6 million, allocated to either or both portions of the Credit Facility, with total commitments under the Credit Facility not to exceed $950.0 million. The availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets owned by us and compliance with various ratios related to those assets. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $42.2 million was available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. For additional information, see Note 6 — Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our Credit Facility. 
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Commencing with such taxable year, we were organized and began operating in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code and believe we have so qualified. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner to continue to qualify as a REIT for such purposes, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes if we were subject to any of these forms of taxation, it would decrease our earnings and our available cash.
In addition, our international assets and operations, including those owned through direct or indirect subsidiaries that are disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.
Competition
The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. In all of our markets we compete for tenants with other owners and operators of real estate. Factors affecting competition for tenants include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The adverse impact of competition may have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates or operating expenses of our properties and may require us to make capital improvements. 
In addition, we compete with other parties engaged in real estate investment activities to identify suitable properties to acquire and to find tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include American Finance Trust, Inc. ("AFIN"), a REIT advised by an affiliate of AR Global, with an investment strategy similar to our investment strategy with respect to properties located in the U.S., other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours, and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have, and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same competitors seek financing through similar channels as us, which may impact our ability to obtain financing. Therefore, we compete for financing in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease. 
Competition from these and other real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. Competition also may cause us to face higher prices to acquire assets, lower yields on assets and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay investments in desirable assets, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability to maintain dividends to stockholders. 
Regulations - General
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
8

Regulations - Environmental 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments and foreign governments at various levels. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. As part of our efforts to mitigate these risks, we typically engage third parties to perform assessments of potential environmental risks when evaluating a new acquisition of property, and we frequently require sellers to address them before closing or obtain contractual protection (indemnities, cash reserves, letters of credit, or other instruments) from property sellers, tenants, a tenant’s parent company, or another third party to address known or potential environmental issues.
Advisory Agreement
We are externally managed by the Advisor pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement with the Advisor, which was subsequently amended on August 14, 2018 (the "August Amendment") and November 6, 2018 (the "November Amendment"). The advisory agreement requires us to pay a base management fee (the “Base Management Fee”) in a minimum amount of $18.0 million per annum, payable in cash on a pro rata monthly basis at the beginning of each month, plus a variable fee amount equal to 1.25% of the cumulative net proceeds realized by us from the issuance of any common equity, including any common equity issued in exchange for or conversion of preferred stock or exchangeable notes, as well as, from any other issuances of common, preferred, or other forms of our equity, including units of any operating partnership. Additionally, we pay the Advisor an incentive fee ("Incentive Compensation"), payable 50% in cash and 50% in shares of Common Stock.
Under the advisory agreement, prior to the August Amendment, the Incentive Compensation was equal to 15% of our Core AFFO (as defined in the advisory agreement) in excess of $2.37 per share plus 10% of our Core AFFO in excess of $3.08 per share. Under the advisory agreement, as amended by the August Amendment, the Incentive Fee Lower Hurdle (as defined in the advisory agreement) was decreased from $2.37 to (a) $2.15 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2019, and (b) $2.25 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2020, and the Incentive Fee Upper Hurdle (as defined in the advisory agreement) was decreased from $3.08 to (a) $2.79 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2019, and (b) $2.92 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2020. 
In addition, the August Amendment revised the provisions in the advisory agreement governing adjustments to these annual thresholds. The annual thresholds may, beginning with effect from July 1, 2020, be increased each year in the sole discretion of a majority of our independent directors (in their good faith reasonable judgment, after consultation with the Advisor), by a percentage equal to between 0% and 3% instead of 1% and 3%. In addition, in August 2023 and every five years thereafter, the Advisor will have a right to request that our independent directors reduce the then current Incentive Fee Lower Hurdle and Incentive Fee Upper Hurdle and make a determination whether any reduction in the annual thresholds is warranted.
We reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates for expenses of the Advisor and its affiliates incurred on our behalf, except for those expenses that are specifically the responsibility of the Advisor under the advisory agreement, such as fees and compensation paid to any third-party service providers engaged by the Advisor and the Advisor's overhead expenses, rent and travel expenses, professional services fees incurred with respect to the Advisor for the operation of its business, insurance expenses (other than with respect to our directors and officers) and information technology expenses.
No later than April 30 of each year, our independent directors are required to determine, in good faith, whether the Advisor has satisfactorily achieved annual performance standards for the immediately preceding year based primarily on actions or inactions of the Advisor, and determines the annual performance standards for the next year.
The advisory agreement has an initial term expiring June 1, 2035, with automatic renewals for consecutive five-year terms unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the advisory agreement. In the event of a termination in connection with a change in control of us or the Advisor's failure (based on a good faith determination by our independent directors) to meet annual performance standards for the year based primarily on actions or inactions of the Advisor, we would be required to pay a termination fee that could be up to two and a half times the compensation paid to the Advisor in the previous year, plus expenses.
See Note 11 — Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K for further details.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we have one employee based in Europe. The employees of our Advisor, Property Manager and other affiliates of AR Global perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management and investor relations services. Pursuant to the Service Provider Agreement, the Former Service Provider agreed to provide, subject to the Advisor's oversight, certain real estate-related services, as well as sourcing and structuring of investment opportunities, performance of due diligence, and arranging debt financing and equity investment syndicates, solely with respect to investments in Europe. As discussed above, on January 16, 2018, we notified the Former Service Provider that it was being terminated effective as of March 17, 2018. We depend on third parties and affiliates for services that 
9

are essential to us, including asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources at potentially higher cost. Since the termination of the Former Service Provider, the Advisor has built a European-focused management team and engaged third-party service providers to assume certain duties previously performed by the Former Service Provider.
