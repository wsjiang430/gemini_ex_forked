ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History
 
We were formed in Delaware on June 26, 1972 as OCR Corporation, underwent a series of name changes and businesses and on April 25, 2008 changed our name to Texas Wyoming Drilling, Inc. On January 26, 2016, we entered into an Equity Exchange Agreement (the “EEA”) whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Drone USA, LLC in exchange for 440,425,388 shares of our common stock and 250 shares of Series A preferred stock, subsequent and pursuant to our completing a 1-for-150 share reverse stock split on all issued and outstanding common stock which resulted in total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 6,368,224 immediately prior to this issuance. In connection with the EEA, 1,253,202 shares of common stock were relinquished and an additional 44,042,539 shares of common stock were issued pursuant to a previous settlement agreement. In connection with the EEA, effective January 26, 2016, we accepted the resignation of Margaret Cadena, the former Chief Executive Officer and Board member, and Richard Kugelman, Dr. Robert Michet, and Dr. David Durkin, the remaining former officers and Board members, and appointed Michael Bannon as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman and Board member and Dennis Antonelos as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and Board member. Dennis Antonelos resigned as our CFO and as a member of our Board on July 10, 2017 and Michael Bannon was appointed as CFO. On May 19, 2016, we changed our name to Drone USA, Inc., we changed our ticker symbol to DRUS, and we completed a 1-for-12 share reverse stock split on all issued and outstanding common stock, with a record date of May 24, 2016, which resulted in total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of 40,841,517 on June 17, 2016 when all round lot issuances were completed.
 
We are currently traded on the OTC Pink market under the symbol DRUS.
 
On June 1, 2016, we entered into an agreement with BRVANT Technologic Solutions (“BRVANT”), a company in Brazil that develops and manufactures UAV systems, embedded systems and simulators for commercial and military customers. We acquired exclusive rights to BRVANT’s UAV technology and intellectual property relating to its UAV technology. As consideration for the agreement, Dr. Rodrigo Kuntz Rangel, BRVANT’s CEO, was appointed to the position of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and issued a stock option grant for 2,000,000 shares of common stock in Drone USA. We have the option to acquire ownership of all outstanding capital stock of BRVANT for additional consideration of $1 million, but we have not made a decision to make that purchase at this time. 
 
On September 9, 2016, Howco became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bantek, Inc.. We acquired all of its issued and outstanding shares held by Paul Charles (“Chuck”) Joy and Kathryn B. Joy, the founders and officers of Howco, for $3,500,000, a warrant for 500,000 shares of Bantek, Inc. common stock with an exercise price of $0.01 per share, and earnout consideration, the funds for which were received from the TCA loan discussed below. We paid $2,600,000 in cash and issued a note to the sellers for $900,000. Howco is a supplier of spare and replacement parts to the United States Federal Government and commercial customers worldwide with expertise in Defense Logistics Agency, TACOM, NECO and other Department of Defense acquisition groups. Howco understands the entire contract and administration management process for Federal Government contracts and supply chain logistics for its Federal Government customers as well as prime contractors with Federal Government contracts. Chuck Joy and Kathryn Joy were retained under contract for a term of two years, a salary of $125,000 and a tiered bonus-structure that is dependent on the gross margin performance of Howco in the subsequent 12 and 24 month periods immediately following the acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, Howco reported revenues of approximately $18.78 million and $24.86 million, and net income of approximately $903,000 and $1,013,000, for the period from October 1, 2015 through September 9, 2016 and the year ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2018, three customers accounted for approximately 52%, 17% and 10% of Howco’s total sales. The customers are the Defense Logistics Agency-Columbus, Defense Logistics Agency-Richmond and the Defense Logistics Agency-Philadelphia, respectively. Howco’s dependence on three significant customers, all part of the Federal Government, is a risk for its ability to maintain or increase its future revenues since the loss of one or both could have significant adverse financial consequences for Howco and Bantek, Inc.

 On November 17, 2016, we entered into a sublease with ESAero for a period of two years commencing February 1, 2017, of office space and engineering design space of approximately 10,000 square feet at a monthly cost of $15,000. The sublease is at 3580 Sueldo Street, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401. We have not made any lease payments since inception of this sublease and do not intend to use this facility since it was based, in large part, on the relationship that we had with a former employee. We could be found to be in default of our obligations under the lease and have accrued on our consolidated financial statements all $360,000 that we would owe under the lease through its full term. 
 
On March 28, 2017, we entered into an agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP (“TCA”) to receive a range of advisory services, particularly assistance with preparation of a business plan and financing strategies, for a total of $1,200,000. If we are quoted on a listed exchange, TCA will accept a single preferred share convertible into common stock never to exceed 4.99% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. The number of shares issued will be set at 100% of the amount due up to availability and subject to a make-whole provision. We have expensed this fee and recorded this as an accrued liability – advisory fee as of March 31, 2017. On January 3, 2018 the TCA advisory fee was added to the principal balance due of convertible notes.
 
In June 2017, we entered into an agreement with an investment bank to provide placement agent services on an exclusive basis as it relates to a private placement (“the placement”). The agreement calls for the investment bank to receive 9% of the gross proceeds of the placement and 2.5% warrant coverage of the amount of raised. The warrants shall entitle the investment bank to purchase securities of the Company at a purchase price equal to 110% of the implied price per share of the placement or 100% of the public market closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the placement, whichever is lower. The warrants shall have a term of five years after the closing of the placement. The agreement expired on September 30, 2017, but we have continued to rely on them for sources of capital and have paid them in accordance with the terms of the prior agreement.
 
On November 15, 2017, we executed a Liability Purchase Term Sheet with Livingston Asset Management (“Livingston”) under which Livingston agreed to purchase up to $10,000,000 that we owe to our creditors through direct purchase of the debts from our creditors in return for (i) a convertible note issued by the Company in the principal amount of $50,000 bearing interest of 10% per year to cover certain legal fees and other expenses of Livingston that matures in six months and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a 30% reduction off the lowest closing bid price for 20 trading days prior to the date of conversion, (ii) a convertible note subject to these same terms as the convertible note issued to Livingston, payable to Scottsdale Capital Advisors in the principal amount of $15,000 as a placement agent fee and (iii) the right of Livingston to retain 30% of any negotiated reduction off the face amount of the liability we owe to such creditors. Following a court judgment (March 2018) for the liabilities purchased by Livingston, we have been issuing free trading shares of our common stock under section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act to Livingston in the amount of such judgment in a series of tranches so that Livingston will not own more than 9.99% of our outstanding shares per tranche.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Our parent company intends to focus on primary drone sales, counter-drone technology sales, drone training and piloted licensed services.
 
Drone Sales
 
When we walk into a police station, a firehouse or a business our primary goal is to match the perfect drone or drones to that customer. To accomplish this, we have aligned with several drone manufacturers, so we can offer a whole line card of drones. We desire to be the “DroneRUS ” of the drone world offering a wide variety of drones at different price points from simple surveillance drones that can fly between 20 minutes and up to one hour, follow a speeding car, avoid obstacles while chasing the speed car such as trees and buildings and re acquire the car if lost. We desire to be our customers’ one-stop shop for all their drone needs.

Counter-Drone Technology Sales
 
Unfortunately, we will all witness the inevitable increase of illegal drone use by drug dealers, terrorists and other unsavory people. For this reason, we have partnered with two counter-drone technology companies to offer drone detection, drone signal jamming and drone system takeover technology that will ultimately aid law enforcement, U.S. industry and our U.S. Government and state governments in combating illegal drones. The market for counter-drone technology could possibly rival the drone market in the not too distant future.
Drone Operator Training
 
We have partnered with DARTDrones to offer drone training throughout the continental United States. In February 2017, DARTDrones received an investment offer on Shark Tank from Mark Cuban. https://www.dartdrones.com/ When signing up for a class, our customers present the coupon “DRONEUSA15” and they will receive a 15% discount on all DARTDrones training. The in-person training includes basic flight training, aerial mapping and modeling, FAA 107 remote pilot test prep and aerial roof inspection training. The online training includes drones for beginners, aerial photography, starting a drone business, Part 107 remote pilot test prep.
Licensed Piloted Services
 
We understand that some police departments and businesses will not want to establish drone programs, employ FAA Part 107 pilots or own their own drones. For this reason, we provide a number of services such search and rescue, utility inspection, real estate marketing, construction, engineering and agriculture. When a service call is received, we respond immediately with a licensed pilot equipped with drones and charged batteries ready to perform the mission requested.
Acquisitions
 
Acquisitions also are an important pillar to our overall growth strategy, providing revenue, earnings, infrastructure and synergies. We seek opportunities with innovative and commercially proven technologies primarily in the UAV industry. We seek profitable firms that complement our overall strategy. We are currently evaluating companies worldwide.
 
An important element of our mergers and acquisitions strategy is to acquire companies with complementary capabilities/technologies and an established customer base in our target markets. We believe that the customer base of each potential acquisition will present an opportunity to cross-sell solutions to the customer base of other acquired companies. We are looking to expand our public sector clients beyond what the Howco acquisition has brought us. Public sector customers provide very large multi-year contracts that we believe can provide secure revenue visibility typically for three to five years. Based on our experience in government contracting, we have a core competency in bidding on government requests for proposals (RFPs). We are actively seeking companies that have built a backlog with various government agencies that can complement our existing contracts through Howco.

Market research media analysts have found that there is a widening gap between growing a UAV fleet and UAV infrastructure development, especially in such sectors as training; service, support and maintenance and data management. This gap creates a number of market opportunities for UAV vendors, both large defense contractors and small technology companies. According to UAV Market Research, military procurement of UAVs, including unmanned aircrafts and payloads, makes the Department of Defense the single largest consumer of UAV technology in the world. We believe that the U.S. Government will continue to invest in UAVs as much as needed to keep its dominance, both technologically and to demonstrate its power, in the next decades.
 
Given the growth and demand in this market, we believe that UAV’s will be a universal tool for government bodies and agencies, particularly focused on law enforcement. Police departments have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy firearms, armored cars and electronic surveillance gear, according to the annual reports submitted by local and state agencies to the Justice Department’s Equitable Sharing Program. Police and law enforcement agencies purchase an expensive mix of high-tech military products, in particular electronic surveillance equipment, for both their technological innovations for supporting their efforts to promote public and citizen confidence by demonstrating their receptiveness to new practices of upholding the law and protecting the public well-being.
 
Howco’s Business
 
Howco is a premier supplier of spare and replacement parts to a wide variety of Federal Government agencies, U.S. military prime contractors and commercial customers worldwide. Founded in 1990 and located in Vancouver, Washington, Howco’s services encompass bid solicitation, contract management, packaging and logistics for construction, transportation, mining and heavy equipment spare and replacement parts to customers worldwide utilizing a wide variety of supply chain solutions. Howco was the winner of the 2012 United States’ Department of Defense Logistics Agency’s Bronze Supplier Award. Howco reported revenues of approximately $18.4 million and $24.5 million, and net income of approximately $164,000 and $252, 000, for the year ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Howco’s Government Services Contracts
 
Howco enters into various types of contracts with our customers, such as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Completion, Cost-reimbursement (CR), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price Incentive (FPI) and Time-and-Materials (T&M). Approximately 91% of Howco’s revenues are FFP and approximately 11% of its revenues are IDIQ.
 
IDIQ contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of services or stated limits of supplies for a fixed period. They are used when the customer cannot determine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the government will require during the contract period. IDIQs help streamline the contract process and speed service delivery. IDIQ contracts are most often used for service contracts and architect-engineering services. Awards are usually for base years and option years. The customer places delivery orders (for supplies) or task orders (for services) against a basic contract for individual requirements. Minimum and maximum quantity limits are specified in the basic contract as either a number of units (for supplies) or as dollar values (for services).

CPFF LOE contracts will be issued when the scope of work is defined in general terms requiring only that the contractor devote a specified LOE for a stated time period. A CPFF completion contract will be issued when the scope of work defines a definite goal or target which leads to an end product deliverable (e.g., a final report of research accomplishing the goal or target).
 
CR contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer and are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.
 
FFP contract will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of definite or detailed specifications and fair and reasonable prices can be established at the outset.
 
FPI target delivery contract will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of reasonably definite or detailed specifications and cost can be reasonably predicted at the outset wherein the cost risk will be shared. A firm target cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula will be negotiated to provide a fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk.
 
T&M contracts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of (i) direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit; and (ii) actual cost for materials. A customer may use this contract when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.
 
Market Size
 
According to Todd Harrison, author of “Analysis of the FY 2017 Budget,” one-third of the DoD budget request, $184.4 billion, is for procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation (“RDT&E”). The U.S. Government spends a portion of this budget on the shipping of replacement parts annually. 
Insulation Jackets
 
We are a reseller of Thermaxx Jackets. Thermaxx Jackets are used to cover mechanical system components such as valves, steam traps, heat exchangers, flanges and other mechanical system components. We are targeting hospitals, manufacturers and universities. We are currently focusing our efforts on the New Jersey market. In the near future, we are looking to target the New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania markets.
Intellectual Property
 
We review each of our intellectual properties and make a determination as to the best means to protect such property, by trademark, by copyright, by patent, by trade secret, or otherwise. We believe that we have taken appropriate steps to protect our intellectual properties, based on our evaluation of the factors unique to each such property, but cannot guarantee that this is the case.
Regulatory Matters
 
The use of unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes is governed by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA” ). On August 29, 2016, the new FAA rules took effect for commercial use of small drones. Under the FAA rules commercial drones must be under 55 pounds and be registered with the FAA. The rules require a new “remote pilot certificate”, daylight-only operations 30 minutes before official sunrise and 30 minutes after official sunset, a requirement that all flights travel at a maximum groundspeed of 100 miles per hour remain, below 400 feet or within 400 feet of a structure and yield the right of way to other aircraft. Under the FAA rules, drone pilots must be at least 16 years old or be supervised by an adult with a remote pilot certificate. The pilot must also maintain “visual line of sight” with the drone at all times, among other requirements. The new rules also require that any drone-related incident that results in at least $500 worth of damage or causes serious injury be reported to the FAA within 10 days. The new restrictions can be waived, but pilots will need to apply directly to the FAA for an exemption and/or a waiver.

Competition
 
Bantek
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for UAVs include product performance, features, acquisition cost, lifetime operating cost, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, size, mobility, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation. We intend to acquire companies that give us a competitive advantage with our prospective government and commercial customers.
 
The market leaders in UAV manufacturing are mostly international and are located in tech hubs. Asia has the most UAV manufacturers currently in operation. Chinese manufacturer DJI is the market leader in the mid to high end recreational platform, followed by French based Parrot with a mid-market recreational platform, and several companies such as XAircraft American based in the United States, with low to mid-market recreational platforms. In addition, in the United States there are large defense contractors, among them Boeing, Northrup Grumman, TCOM, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, ISL, ILC Dover, Compass Systems, Raven Aerostar and American Blimp Corporation offering military grade free flying drones to the U.S. Government. There is also potential competition from commercial grade tethered drone systems which remain tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether, such as offered by Elistair located in Lyon, France and Cyphy Works Inc. located in Danvers, Massachusetts.
 
Howco
 
The business of supplying spare and replacement parts to Federal Government agencies, U.S. military prime contractors and commercial customers is very competitive. Among our U.S. based competitors are JGILS that supplies parts manufactured by Fairbanks Morse/Coltec and other brands, Ohio Cat that supplies Caterpillar parts, and Kampi Components and Brighton Cromwell, both of which compete with us in several brands. 
Employees
 
We have 15 full-time employees, one with Bantek and 14 are with Howco, and one part-time employee with Howco. We have no labor union contracts and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
Debt Instruments
 
The Company has a revolving line of credit with a financial institution, which balance is due on demand and principal payments are due monthly at 1/60th of the outstanding principal balance. This revolving line of credit is in the amount of $50,000, and is personally guaranteed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The line bears interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the prime rate plus 4.25%, which at September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was 9.25% and 8.50%, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, the balance of the line of credit was $45,915 with $4,085 available.
 
We have an $840,000 convertible note dated December 11, 2015, payable with Abatement Industries Group, Inc. (“AIG”), an entity controlled by our CEO. The Note bears interest at an annual rate of 7% with a maturity date of June 11, 2017, at which time all unpaid principal and interest is due. In August 2018, the maturity date of the note was extended to June 11, 2022. In conjunction with the amendment the note was assumed by Pike Falls LLC which is also controlled by our CEO. The holder of the note has the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest, in whole or in part, into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the volume weighted average price per share of common stock for the 30-day period prior to conversion. As of September 30, 2018, the note payable has not been converted and the balance of the note is approximately $688,000, and accrued interest was approximately $126,000.
 
We issued a convertible note dated July 1, 2016, payable to our CEO for $117,000. The note bears interest at an annual rate of 7% with a maturity rate of January 1, 2018. The holder of the note has the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest, in whole or in part, into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the volume weighted average price per share of common stock for the 30-day period prior to conversion. As of September 30, 2018, the note payable has not been converted and the balance of the note is approximately $27,700, and accrued interest was approximately $11,350. The Company and our CEO extended the maturity of this note until June 30, 2019.
 
In connection with the acquisition of Howco on September 9, 2016, we issued a note payable to the sellers in the amount of $900,000. The note bears an interest of 5.5% and all unpaid principal and accrued interest is due on September 9, 2017. The note is in default and is accruing interest at 8% per year. The Company is in discussion with the sellers over the asserted claim that the sellers withdrew excessive amounts of cash from the business prior to the acquisition. The   note is subordinated to the TCA loan described below. As of September 30, 2018, the note payable has a balance of approximately $900,000 with accrued interest of approximately $125,700.

Effective  September 13, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement (the “Credit Facility” or the “Agreement”) with TCA Global Credit Master Fund L.P (“TCA”) to provide capital for the acquisition of HowCo. We can borrow up to $6,500,000, with an initial loan at closing of $3,500,000. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all our assets and our subsidiaries and bears interest at a rate of 18%, requires monthly payments of $52,500 which is interest only starting on October 13, 2016 through February 13, 2017, and monthly payments, including interest and principal, of $298,341 starting on March 13, 2017 through maturity on March 13, 2018. Events of default are defined in the Agreement. In the event of default the note balance will bear interest at 25%. In connection with this Agreement, we are obligated to pay additional advisory fees of $850,000 payable in the form of cash or common stock in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. We were also required to reserve 7,000,000 shares of common stock related to this transaction. The reserved shares will be released upon the satisfaction of the loan. In the event TCA makes additional loans under the Agreement, we agree to pay additional advisory fees under similar terms as the $850,000 fee. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, except in limited circumstances, we are not permitted to encumber any of our assets, sell any shares of common stock or incur additional indebtedness without TCA’s prior written consent. All of our assets, including the assets of Howco, are secured by the TCA credit facility, which could be sold by TCA to satisfy the debt we owe it should we not be able to repay TCA in full.
  
As of March 31, 2017, we issued to TCA 539,204 shares of common stock in satisfaction of the $850,000 advisory fees in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility. Based upon the value of the shares, at the time TCA sells the shares, we may be required to redeem unsold shares for the difference between the $850,000 and TCA’s sales proceeds. Accordingly, the $850,000 has been reflected as a current liability as of September 30, 2017. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement to the contrary, in the event TCA has not realized net proceeds from the sale of Advisory Fee Shares equal to at least the Advisory Fee by the earlier to occur of: (A) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Effective Date; (B) the occurrence of an Event of Default; or (C) the Maturity Date, then at any time thereafter, TCA shall have the right, upon written notice to us, to require that we redeem all Advisory Fee Shares then in TCA’s possession for cash equal to the Advisory Fee, less any cash proceeds received by TCA from any previous sales of Advisory Fee Shares, if any. In the event such redemption notice is given by TCA, we shall redeem the then remaining Advisory Fee Shares in TCA’s possession for an amount of Dollars equal to the Advisory Fee, less any cash proceeds received by TCA from any previous sales of Advisory Fee Shares, if any, payable by wire transfer to an account designated by TCA within five (5) Business Days from the date TCA delivers such redemption notice to us. As of September 30, 2017, the note payable has not been converted and the balance of the note was $3,500,000 and accrued interest was $169,417. The Credit Facility is only convertible upon default or mutual agreement by both parties. Once a default occurs the note will be accounted for as stock settled debt at its fixed monetary value and any shares issued upon conversion are also subject to a make whole provision similar to that described above for the $850,000. On March 13, 2017, we defaulted on the monthly principal and interest payment of $298,341. On April 13, 2017, the Company received a default notice from the lender and was given a 10-day period to cure the default. The note became convertible and the interest rate increased to 25% (default rate) upon expiration of the default cure period, as the default was not cured. From March to December 2017, the Company has not made the required monthly contracted payments.
 
On March 28, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the above senior secured credit facility lender to receive a range of advisory services for a total of $1,200,000 with no definitive terms or length of service which was expensed in fiscal 2017 and had been recorded as an accrued liability – advisory fees through December 31, 2017. In connection with the settlement agreement discussed below, in January 2018, the advisory services fee payable was reclassified to the principal balance of the replacement Convertible Note.
 
On January 3, 2018, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) and replacement note agreements with TCA related to the senior secured credit facility note dated September 13, 2016. On the effective date of the Settlement Agreement, all amounts owed to TCA aggregated $5,788,642 and consisted of a convertible promissory note of $3,500,000, accrued interest payable of $238,642, and accrued advisory fees payable of $2,050,000. Additionally, on the effective date, the amount due of $5,788,642 was split into 2 separate and distinct replacement notes (“Replacement Note A” and “Replacement Note B”). Replacement Note A shall have a principal amount of $1,000,000 and Replacement Note B shall have a principal balance of $4,788,642, both of which shall be and remained secured by the original security agreements, the pledge agreements, the guarantee agreement and other applicable loan documents and both shall bear interest at 18% per annum. The default was not waived by this settlement agreement. The interest rate was amended to 12% effective June 12, 2018. The Credit Agreement is hereby amended such that the Maturity Date is extended to January 13, 2019 (the “Extended Maturity Date”) for replacement Note B, while the Note A maturity date remained at March 13, 2018 but was due as of March 2017 due to the principal and interest payment default discussed above. Replacement Note A was subsequently acquired by Livingston Asset Management (discussed below) in conjunction with a 3(a)(10) transaction.
 
On October 30, 2018 TCA the Company’s senior lender amended its credit facility which had been restructured in January 2018 when fees due for advisory and other matters along with accrued but unpaid interest were capitalized and separated into two notes, Note A having $1,000,000 principal and Note B having $4,788,642 both having the same maturity terms, interest rates and conversion rights. Under the current amendment total amounts outstanding under the notes along with accrued interest have been capitalized with the principal amount due of $6,018,192.42. The new note accrues interest on the principal balance at 12% per annum, includes amortization to the new maturity of December 15, 2020. The amortization payments credited toward the principal amount and accrued interest vary and include payments made under the settlement agreement with a third party related to Note A. Economically the total principal and accrued interest outstanding remain unchanged as reported in the consolidated balance sheet. All other terms including conversion rights and a make-whole provision in the case of a conversion shortfall remain the same as stated above.

On November 9, 2017, the Company received a first tranche payment of $75,500 under the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement dated October 25, 2017, with Crown Bridge Partners, LLC (“Crown Bridge”) under which the Company issued to Crown Bridge a convertible note in the principal amount of $105,000 and a five-year warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.35 as a commitment fee which is equal to the product of one-third of the face value of each tranche divided by $0.35. Under the terms of the note Crown Bridge was to receive “right of first refusal” for any subsequent loans or notes to fund the Company. The Company violated this covenant when funding was received from other sources without offering Crown Bridge the opportunity to participate. On December 20, 2017 the Company cured this covenant violation by issuing 200,000 additional warrants have the same exercise price and terms of the original warrants.

The Note is subject to customary default provisions and also includes a cross-default provision as well as default being triggered if the Company loses the “bid” price for its common stock ($0.0001 on the “ask” with zero market makers on the “bid” per Level 2 and/or a market such as OTC Pink) and a $15,000 penalty if not paid by the maturity date.

In November 2017, the Company accounted for the convertible promissory note as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and recorded a debt premium of $57,885 with a charge to interest expense. On February 7, 2018 the Company amended the terms to the Note whereby Labrys waiving certain existing events of default on the Note and in return will no longer be required, under any circumstances, to return the commitment shares back to the Company’s treasury. The Company was under default for failing to maintain a market capitalization of at least $5,000,000 on any trading day.

On December 7, 2017, the Company received a payment of $79,000, net of an original issue discount of $5,800 and issue costs of $20,200 fees which was recorded as a debt discount which is being amortized into interest expense over the Note term, under the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement dated November 21, 2017, with EMA Financial, LLC (“EMA Financial”) under which the Company issued to EMA Financial a convertible note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of $105,000 that bears interest of 10% (24% default rate) per annum. The Note has a maturity date of December 7, 2018 and has a conversion rate for any unpaid principal and interest at a conversion price which is the lower of (i) the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of funding and (ii) a 35% discount to (a) the lowest sales price of the shares of the Company’s common stock within a 20 day trading period including and immediately preceding the conversion date or (b) the lowest bid price on the conversion date, whichever is lower, and the conversion shares contain piggy-back registration rights. The conversion rate is further reduced under certain events, including if the closing sales price is less than $0.095 in which case the conversion rate is a 50% discount under the terms set forth above. No shares of the Company’s common stock can be issued to the extent EMA Financial would own more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also is required at all times to have authorized and reserved eight times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion or adjustment of the Note (based on the conversion price of the Note in effect from time to time) and initially must instruct its transfer agent to reserve 6,802,000 shares of common stock in the name of EMA Financial for issuance upon conversion. The Note is subject to customary default provisions and also includes a cross-default provision as well as default being triggered if the Company loses the “bid” price for its common stock ($0.0001 on the “ask” with zero market makers on the “bid” per Level 2 and/or a market such as OTC Pink). The Company is entitled to prepay the Note between the issue date until 180 days from its issuance at a premium of 135% of the unpaid principal and interest if paid within 90 days after the issue date and 150% thereafter. In connection with the issuance of this Note, the Company determined that the terms of the Note contain a conversion formula that caused variations in the conversion price resulting in the treatment of the conversion option as a bifurcated derivative to be accounted for at fair value. Accordingly, under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in an Entity’s Own Stock”, the embedded conversion option contained in the convertible instruments were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion option derivatives were determined using the Binomial valuation model. At the end of each period, the Company revalued the embedded conversion option and warrants derivative liabilities. In connection with this Note, on the initial measurement date of December 7, 2017, the fair values of the embedded conversion option derivative of $149,028 was recorded as derivative liabilities, $70,028 was charged to current period operations as initial derivative expense, and $79,000 was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of this Note. At each reporting date during the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company revalued the embedded conversion option derivative liability. At September 30, 2018 the Company has fully recorded derivative liability as part of the gain (loss) in debt extinguishment in conjunction with the full conversion of the note into common stock.
 
A number of terms included in the Securities Purchase Agreement and Note issued subsequently (see paragraph below) were more favorable than the terms granted to EMA Financial under its Securities Purchase Agreement and the EMA Note. Accordingly, on December 31, 2017, EMA Financial notified the Company that pursuant to the EMA Securities Purchase Agreement that the EMA Note was automatically amended by increasing (i) the annual interest rate to 12% percent and (ii) the Original Issue Discount by $3,650.
 
EMA fully converted all principal, default charges ($3,650) and accrued interest into common shares during 2018 and surrendered the note. The Company recognized $273,864 of losses on debt extinguishment during July 2018 as a result of the fair market value of the shares issued exceeded the recorded amount of the derivative liability discussed above.
 
On December 13, 2017, the Company received a payment of $60,000, net of original issue discount fees of $7,500 and $15,000 of issue costs recorded as debt discounts and amortized to interest expense over the Note term under the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement dated December 8, 2017, with Morningview Financial, LLC (“Morningview Financial”) under which the Company issued to Morningview Financial a convertible note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of $82,500 that bears interest of 12% (18% default rate) per annum.

The conversion rate is further reduced under certain events, including if the closing sales price is less than $0.05 in which case the conversion rate is a 45% discount under the terms set forth above. No shares of the Company’s common stock can be issued to the extent Morningview Financial would own more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also is required at all times to have authorized and reserved eight times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion or adjustment of the Note (based on the conversion price of the Note in effect from time to time). The Note is subject to customary default provisions and also includes a cross-default provision as well as default being triggered if the Company’s Trading Price as that term is defined in the Note is less than $.0001 or if a money judgment, writ or similar process shall be entered or filed against the Company or any of its subsidiaries for more than $50,000, and shall remain unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of 20 days unless otherwise consented to by the holder of the Note. Additionally, upon default and default notice by the lender, the amount immediately due shall be increased to 150% or 200% of the outstanding principal and interest due depending upon the default provisions, plus default interest. The Company is entitled to prepay the Note between the issue date until 180 days from its issuance at a premium of 135% of the unpaid principal and interest.

Power Up received a right of first refusal for the first nine months from the date of the Note to provide any debt or equity financing less than $150,000. The Note bears interest at 10% per annum and has a maturity date of December 15, 2018. The Note may be prepaid at a premium ranging from 112% to 137% depending on the length of time following the date of the Note. The Note is convertible after 180 days into shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount of 35% of the average of the two lowest closing bid prices of the Company’s common stock 15 days prior to the date of conversion and the maximum number of shares issued to Power Up may not exceed 4.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Drone USA common stock. The Note is subject to customary default provisions, including a cross default provision. The Company is required to have authorized for issuance six times the number of shares that would be issuable upon full conversion of the Note (assuming that the 4.99% limitation is not in effect) and based on the applicable conversion price of the Note in effect from time to time, initially to be 13,046,154 shares of common stock. The Company has accounted for the convertible promissory note as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and recorded a debt premium of $28,538 with a charge to interest expense. The principal balance and accrued interest were fully converted as of September 30, 2018. Debt premium $28,538 was recorded as additional paid in capital on a prorata basis at each conversion date.

On August 29, 2018 the Company entered into an agreement with a legal firm to provide securities related and other legal services. Under the agreement the Company will issue convertible notes with varying principal amounts for services. The first note was issued on August 29, 2018 for $6,000, interest of 12%, maturity date of February 28, 2018. The conversion feature allows for conversion into common shares at the lesser of: a) 70% of the share price on the date of the note; or b) 50% of the lowest bid price during the 30 trading days preceding the date of the notice of conversion. In connection with the issuance of this Note, the Company determined that the terms of the Note contain a conversion formula that caused variations in the conversion price resulting in the treatment of the conversion option as a bifurcated derivative to be accounted for at fair value. Accordingly, under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in an Entity’s Own Stock”, the embedded conversion option contained in the convertible instruments were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion option derivatives were determined using the Binomial valuation model. $10,435 was recognized as derivative liability with $6,000 charged to debt discount and $4,035 charged to derivative expense on issuance. The debt discount of $6,000 will be amortized to interest expense to the maturity date of the note. At September 30, 2018 the derivative fair value was determined to have decreased to $9,474 with a credit to derivative expense of $961. At September 30, $1,000 of debt discount was charged to interest expense.
 
On September 4, 2018 and September 18, 2018 the Company issued additional convertible notes of $10,000 and $6,000 respectively for legal services to the same legal firm. The notes have 6 month maturities and 12% interest rates. The notes are convertible into common shares at a discount of 50% to the lowest bid price in the 30 trading days immediately preceding the notice of conversion. The Company has accounted for the convertible promissory note as stock settled debt under ASC 480 and recorded debt premiums of $10,000 and $6,000 with a charge to interest expense for the notes.

Emerging Growth Company
 
We are and we will remain an “emerging growth company” as defined under The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated filer” (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
As an “emerging growth company”, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
 

● | only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” disclosure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 
Notwithstanding the above, we are also currently a “smaller reporting company”, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a “smaller reporting company”, at such time as we cease being an “emerging growth company”, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an “emerging growth company” or a “smaller reporting company”.  Specifically, similar to “emerging growth companies”, “smaller reporting companies” are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being k]=required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.
