Introduction
 
SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. (“SCI”, “we” or the “Company”), formerly Superconductive Components, Inc., an Ohio corporation, was incorporated in 1987.  We operate in one segment as a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for Physical Vapor Deposition (“PVD”) Thin Film Applications. We are focused on markets within the PVD industry including Photonics, Thin Film Solar, Glass, and Transparent Electronics.  Substantially all of our revenues are generated from customers with multi-national operations.  We have made a considerable resource investment in the Thin Film Solar industry and a number of customers have adopted our products.  Through collaboration with end users and Original Equipment Manufacturers the Company develops innovative customized solutions enabling commercial success.
 
History of the Company
 
The late Dr. Edward Funk, Sc.D., and his late wife Ingeborg founded SCI in 1987. Dr. Funk, formerly a Professor of Metallurgy at The Ohio State University and a successful entrepreneur, envisioned significant market potential for the then newly discovered High Temperature Superconductivity (“HTS”) material YBCO (Tc of 90o K). Our first product was a 99.999% pure, co-precipitated YBCO 1-2-3 powder. Over the years we expanded our product line by adding other High Tc Powders, sintered shapes, single crystal substrates, and non-superconducting sputtering targets. At this time we are not pursuing this market but these early years of development is the foundation on which our material science experience is built.
 
We opened a subdivision, Target Materials Inc. (“TMI”), in 1991 to supply the increasing worldwide demand for sputtering and laser ablation targets. We became a full service manufacturer of high performance thin film materials, providing a wide selection of metals, ceramics, and alloys for sputtering targets, evaporation sources, and other PVD applications. We served the Research and Development market as well as the Industrial and Decorative Coating markets. During this time, we began to manufacture targets for the photovoltaic, flat panel display, and semiconductor industries.
 
SCI and TMI were merged in 2002. We continued to manufacture complex ceramic, metal, and alloy products for the photonic, photovoltaic, thin film battery, media storage, flat panel display, and semiconductor industries.
 
In January 2017, we received ISO 9001:2015 registration, an internationally recognized quality standard. We received ISO 9001:2008 registration in April 2010 and prior to April 2010 we were ISO 9001:2000 registered.
 
Throughout much of our history, we have conducted funded research primarily under grants from entities such as the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Ohio Development Services Agency (formerly known as the Ohio Department of Development). These activities are generally limited to funded research that is consistent with our focus on near term commercial applications in our principal markets.
 
For more than three decades we have been developing considerable expertise in the development and manufacturing ramp-up of innovative materials, such as Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCO) for Thin Film Solar (TFS) applications and targets for thin film batteries. Today, we serve a diverse base of domestic and multi-national corporations, universities, and leading research institutions. We actively seek to partner with organizations to provide solutions for difficult material challenges.
 
Business
 
We are a supplier of materials to the PVD industry. Our customers need our materials to produce nano layers of metals and oxides for advanced material systems. Applications for PVD coatings range from everyday items to complex computer processors. Every day applications include transparent anti-scratch coatings on eyeglasses, coatings on kitchen faucets, as well as low emissivity glass for household windows. More technically advanced applications for our products include semiconductors, thin film solar, flat panel displays and photonics.

We continue to pursue niche opportunities where our core competencies give us an advantage and that fit our manufacturing capabilities. This disciplined approach enables us to focus on those opportunities that are the best fit for our capabilities and also offer the greatest long-term return. Considerations include our core strengths, resource requirements, and time-to-market.
 
Photonics currently represents the largest market for our materials. Our customers are continually identifying new materials that improve the utility of optical coatings. This includes improvements in their ability to focus, filter or reflect light, all of which increase the potential demand for the types and amounts of products we sell in this market. Photonic applications continue to expand as new methods are found to manipulate light waves to enhance the various applications for light.
 
We have developed products for the TFS market. We are well positioned in the TFS area having supplied materials to that market for over twenty years from the early stages of TFS development. We continue to increase our visibility in the global arena by attending various trade shows targeted at the solar market. During the second half of 2016 we launched a new marketing and sales strategy that involves increased direct contact with customers and entry into contiguous markets. We also have representatives for Korea, China, and Taiwan in 2018. China was the largest market for our TFS products. Orders for TFS products significantly accelerated during 2018 resulting in increased year-end backlog. Market expansion is expected to continue in 2019 and we are poised to benefit, with minimal capital additions, as TFS continues to be adopted globally. We see increased opportunities in both domestic and foreign markets.
 
We continued to develop TCO systems for the solar and glass markets and added domestic and international customers for these products. The solar industry is projected to have strong growth for the next few decades. The TFS market, which we serve, is expected to gain market share beyond traditional applications to include, but not limited to, roof applications with low weight flexible products, vehicles and mobile devices during that period. Given current and future market opportunities, we continue to invest in research and development, marketing, and sales.
 
In 2018, we began to supply target materials to the roll to roll coating industry. Roll to roll PVD coating is an emerging market in which intermediate manufacturers use our advanced materials to coat flexible substrates for a wide range of applications. In a roll to roll coating system, multiple layers of different materials can be deposited over large areas on flexible substrates without costly down time associated with breaking vacuum. These coated substrates can be used as standalone products in high volume consumer goods or can be laminated into electronic and optical components such as solar panels, architectural glass and displays. Our rotatable bonding technology, compounded with our material development capabilities position us well in this emerging market for potential growth.
 
Late in 2018 we announced plans to begin manufacturing thin film solar products in China beginning mid-year 2019. Under a joint agreement with publicly owned Konfoong Materials International Co., LTD (KFMI), KFMI will bond rotatable thin film solar Aluminum Zinc Oxide cylinders produced in Columbus, Ohio for thin film solar customers in China. This arrangement is intended to enable us to provide an advantage to TFS customers and also to help assure access to this growing market. We will continue to produce the ceramic portion of the end product in our facility in Columbus. We will continue to exercise control over our trade secret and proprietary property through assiduous scrutiny of our Intellectual Property. Our products for photonics and thin film solar customers in areas other than China will continue to be bonded at our manufacturing facility in Columbus.
 
We continue to invest in developing new products for all current markets with emphasis on accelerating time to market.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had total revenue of $11,361,575. This was an increase of $4,560,210, or 67.0% compared to 2017. The increase was due to increased sales of thin film solar products plus pricing and product mix in our photonics markets.
 
Our largest customer represented approximately 36% of total revenues in 2018 and 72% in 2017.

Marketing and Sales
 
Europe and Asia, as well as the Americas, have high demand for sputtering targets. We continue to expand our global marketing reach. We have a manufacturer’s representative in the Korean market as well as the Taiwan and China markets. We use various distribution channels to reach end user markets, including direct sales by our employees, independent manufacturers’ representatives in the United States, and independent distributors and manufacturers’ representatives for international markets. Also, the internet provides tremendous reach for new customers to be able to identify us as a source of their product needs.
 
Our corporate website is www.sciengineeredmaterials.com. The website is designed to serve customers, suppliers and investors with additional information in an easy to use format and includes expanded mobile access. There are also social media components, including LinkedIn® and Facebook®, to enhance the Company’s visibility and communication with all stakeholders. For customers and suppliers, there is expanded information about our product focus as well as a library of detailed product data sheets that continues to be updated. Investors can access current and archived information about the Company utilizing multiple electronic platforms.
 
Ceramics
 
We are capable of producing ceramic powders via several different processing techniques including solid state and precipitation. Ceramic targets can also be produced in a variety of ways depending on the end user applications. Production techniques include sintering, cold isostatic pressing and hot pressing.
 
Most of our products are manufactured from component chemicals and metal oxides supplied by various vendors. If we suddenly lost the services of a supplier, there could be a disruption in our manufacturing process until the supplier was replaced. We have identified several firms as potential back-up suppliers that would be capable of supplying these materials to us as necessary.
 
Metals
 
In addition to the ceramic targets previously mentioned, we produce metal sputtering targets and backing plates. The targets are often bonded to the backing plates for application in the PVD industry. These targets can be produced by casting, hot pressing and machining of metals and metal alloys depending on the application.
 
Applications for metal targets are highly varied from applying decorative coatings for end uses such as sink faucets to the production of various electronic, photonic and semiconductor products.
 
We purchase various metals of reasonable high purity (often above 99.9%) for our applications. We are not dependent on a single source for these metals and do not believe losing a vendor would materially affect our business.
 
We have continually added production processes and testing equipment to enable us to manufacture and qualify many product compositions that can be used as PVD materials.
 
Competition
 
We have a number of domestic and international competitors in both the ceramic and metal fields, many of whom have resources far in excess of our resources. Tosoh, Materion Corporation and Kurt Lesker are competing suppliers in regard to targets.
Suppliers
 
Principal suppliers in 2018 were Johnson Matthey, Sophisticated Alloys and Six Nine Metals. In every case, we have established alternate vendors that can be used to ensure availability of required materials. As volume grows, we may enter into alliances or purchasing contracts with these or other vendors.
Research and Development
 
We are developing sputtering targets for transparent electronic applications, which could be used to produce transparent thin film transistors via PVD processing. We have ongoing development for product improvements and new Transparent Conductive Oxide for Thin Film Solar and wide area coating applications. Much of the development for these new products is based on doping zinc oxide (ZnO). We have developed considerable expertize working with ZnO from our aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) development. We are also developing a dielectric material for semiconductor applications. We focus our research and development efforts in areas that build on our core competencies.

We are working with customers through product trials and qualifications. We continue to invest in developing new products for all of our markets including transparent conductive oxide systems for the thin film solar and display markets as well as with our transparent electronic products.
 
We have new materials under development that may replace the Cadmium Sulfide buffer layer in CIGS solar cells. These materials were tested at Case Western Reserve University and the results support the use of our innovative material in thin film solar applications that could lead to higher efficiencies.
 
We may seek funded research opportunities within our core competencies that maintain and expand technical understanding within our company.
 
In 2017, we had a collaborative program with Kent State University to evaluate our TCO materials in liquid crystal display applications.
 
We have certain proprietary knowledge and trade secrets related to the manufacture of metal and metal oxide PVD materials. This includes specific patents directly related to our products and market focus (see Intellectual Property section below).
 
New Product Initiatives
 
We continue to develop TCO target materials for the Thin Film Solar market in partnership with both original equipment manufacturers and Thin Film Solar Cell panel fabricators.  A combination of Third Frontier grants and loans provided by the Ohio Development Services Agency and the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority enabled us to accelerate both our development of new products and expanding our manufacturing capacity to meet demands in an evolving marketplace. In addition, we have developed a Zinc Magnesium Oxide material that may be used as a buffer layer material in Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide (CIGS) solar cells.
 
Our research and development team includes two Ph.D.’s. One member of the team has a degree in Material Science and the other holds a doctorate in Physics. This diverse knowledge base is essential for our products to be successful. The applications in which we are involved require a deeper understanding than only the material properties. Our team provides knowledge in the areas of optical and electrical properties in these applications.

We have an additional provisional patent application that is pending relating to superior bonding processes and products, and it is our intention to continue to pursue protection of this technology through the patent process in the US and other jurisdictions.
 
In the future, we may submit additional patent applications covering various inventions which have been developed by us.  Because the publication of U.S. patent applications can be delayed for up to one year, they tend to lag behind actual discoveries and we may not be the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications for such inventions.  Additionally, other parties may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our technologies or, if patents are issued to us or rights licensed by us, design around the patented aspects of any technologies we developed or licensed.
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark law, license agreements, internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property, which may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products may be produced or sold may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 
Employees
 
We had 26 and 18 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. One of these employees holds a PhD in Material Science and another holds a PhD in Physics. One of these individuals has expertise in application for the Display market. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with employees to be good. The employees do not have a bargaining unit.
Environmental Matters
 
We handle all materials according to federal, state and local environmental regulations and include Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) with all shipments to customers.  We maintain a collection of MSDS sheets for all raw materials used in the manufacture of products and maintenance of equipment and insure that all personnel follow the handling instructions contained in the MSDS for each material.  We contract with a reputable. fully permitted hazardous waste disposal company to dispose of the small amount of hazardous waste generated.
Collections and Write-offs
 
We collected receivables in an average of 42 days in 2018. We have occasionally written-off negligible amounts of accounts receivable as uncollectible. There were none in 2018 and 2017. We consider credit management critical to our success.
Seasonal Trends
 
We have not experienced and do not expect to experience seasonal trends in future business operations.
