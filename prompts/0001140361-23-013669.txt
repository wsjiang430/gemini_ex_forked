Our company
 
Ollie’s is a highly differentiated and fast-growing, extreme value retailer of brand name merchandise at drastically reduced prices.  Known for our assortment of products offered as “Good Stuff Cheap,” we offer customers a broad selection of brand name products, including housewares, bed and bath, food, floor coverings, health and beauty aids, books and stationery, toys and electronics. Our differentiated go-to market strategy is characterized by a unique, fun and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, compelling customer value proposition and witty, humorous in-store signage and advertising campaigns. These attributes have driven our rapid growth and strong and consistent store performance.
 
Ollie’s was founded based on the idea that “everyone in America loves a bargain.” Since opening our first store in Mechanicsburg, PA in 1982, we have grown organically by backfilling existing markets and leveraging our brand awareness, marketing, and infrastructure to expand into new markets in contiguous states. We have grown to 468 stores in 29 states as of January 28, 2023. Our no-frills, “semi-lovely” warehouse style stores average approximately 33,000 square feet and generate consistently strong financial returns across all vintages, geographic regions, population densities, demographic groups, real estate formats and regardless of any co-tenant. Our business model has resulted in positive financial performance during strong and weak economic cycles. We believe there is opportunity for more than 1,050 Ollie’s locations across the United States based on internal estimates and third party research conducted by Hoffman Strategy Group, a retail real estate feasibility consultant that provides market analysis and strategic planning and consulting services.
 
Our constantly changing merchandise assortment is procured by a highly experienced merchant team, who leverage deep, long-standing relationships with hundreds of major manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, brokers and retailers. These relationships enable our merchant team to find and select only the best buys from a broad range of brand name and closeout product offerings and to pass drastically reduced prices along to our customers. As we grow, we believe our increased scale has provided and will continue to provide us with even greater access to brand name products as many large manufacturers favor large buyers capable of acquiring an entire deal. Our merchant team augments these deals with directly sourced products, including Ollie’s own private label brands and other products exclusive to Ollie’s.

Our competitive strengths
 
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our current and future growth:
 
“Good Stuff Cheap”—Ever changing product assortment at drastically reduced prices.  Our stores offer something for everyone across a diverse range of merchandise categories at prices up to 70% below department and fancy stores and up to 20-50% below mass market retailers. Our product assortment frequently changes based on the wide variety of deals available from the hundreds of brand name suppliers we have relationships with. We augment these opportunistic deals on brand name merchandise with directly-sourced unbranded products or those under our own private label brands and exclusively licensed recognizable brands and celebrity names. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented approximately 65% and non-closeout goods and private label products collectively represented approximately 35% of the retail value of our 2022 merchandise purchases.  Our treasure hunt shopping environment and slogan “when it’s gone, it’s gone” help to instill a “shop now” sense of urgency that encourages frequent customer visits.
 
Highly experienced and disciplined merchant team.  Our merchant team maintains strong, long-standing relationships with a diverse group of suppliers, allowing us to procure branded merchandise at compelling values for our customers. We have been doing business with our top 15 suppliers for an average of over 15 years.  Our well-established relationships with our suppliers, together with our scale, buying power, financial credibility and responsiveness, often make Ollie’s the first call for available deals. Our direct relationships with our suppliers have increased as we have grown and we continuously strive to broaden our supplier network. These factors provide us with increased access to goods, which enable us to be more selective in our deal-making and, we believe, help us provide compelling value and assortment of goods to our customers and fuel our continued profitable growth.
 


 Index

Distinctive brand and engaging shopping experience.  Our distinctive and often self-deprecating humor and highly recognizable caricatures are used in our stores, flyers, mailers, website and email campaigns. We attempt to make our customers laugh as we poke fun at ourselves and current events. We believe this approach creates a strong connection to our brand and sets us apart from other, more traditional retailers. Our “semi-lovely” stores feature these same brand attributes together with witty signage in a warehouse format that creates a fun, relaxed and engaging shopping environment. We believe that by disarming our customers by getting them to giggle a bit, they are more likely to look at and trust our products for what they are—extremely great bargains. We offer a “30-day no hard time guarantee” as a means to overcome any skepticism associated with our cheap prices and to build trust and loyalty, because if our customers are not happy, we are not happy. We welcome customers to bring back their merchandise within that timeframe for a “no hard time” full refund. We also make it easy for our customers to browse our stores by displaying our products on easily accessible fixtures and by keeping the stores clean and well-lit. We believe our humorous brand image, compelling values and welcoming stores resonate with our customers and define Ollie’s as a unique and comfortable destination shopping location.
 
Extremely loyal “Ollie’s Army” customer base.  Our best customers are members of our Ollie’s Army customer loyalty program, which stands at 13.2 million members as of January 28, 2023.  For 2022, over 80% of our sales were from Ollie’s Army members, and we grew our base of loyal members by 4.8% in 2022. Ollie’s Army members spend approximately 40% more per shopping trip at Ollie’s than non-members.  We identify our target customer as “anyone age 25 or older with a wallet or a purse” seeking a great bargain.
 
Strong and consistent store model built for growth.  We employ a proven new store model that generates strong cash flow, consistent financial results and attractive returns on investment. Our highly flexible real estate approach has proven successful across all vintages, geographic regions, population densities, demographic groups, real estate formats and regardless of any co-tenant. New stores opened from 2017 to 2021 have generated an average of $4.6 million in net sales in their first 12 months of operations and produced an average payback period of approximately two years. We believe that our consistent store performance, strategically-located distribution centers, and disciplined approach to site selection support the portability and predictability of our new unit growth strategy.
 
Highly experienced and passionate management team.  Our leadership team has guided our organization through its expansion and positioned us for continued growth. We have assembled a talented and dedicated team of executives. Our senior executives possess extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines, including merchandising, marketing, real estate, finance, store operations, supply chain management, and information technology. We believe by encouraging equity ownership and fostering a strong team culture, we have aligned the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. We believe these factors result in a cohesive team focused on sustainable long-term growth.
 
Our growth strategy
 
We plan to continue to drive growth in sales and profitability by executing on the following strategies:
 
Grow our store base.  We believe our compelling value proposition and the success of our stores across a broad range of geographic regions, population densities and demographic groups create a significant opportunity to profitably increase our store count. Our internal estimates and third-party research conducted by Hoffman Strategy Group indicate the potential for more than 1,050 national locations. Our new store real estate model is flexible and focuses predominately on second generation sites ranging in size from 25,000 to 35,000 square feet. We believe there is an ample supply of suitable low-cost, second generation real estate to allow us to infill within our existing markets as well as to expand into new, contiguous geographies. This approach leverages our distribution infrastructure, field management team, store management, marketing investments and brand awareness. We expect our new store openings to be the primary driver of our continued, consistent growth in sales and profitability.
 


 Index

Increase our offerings of great bargains.  We will continue to enhance our supplier relationships and develop additional sources to acquire brand name and closeout products for our customers. Our direct buying relationships with many major manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, brokers, and retailers provide us with significant opportunities to expand our ever-changing assortment of brand name and closeout merchandise at extreme values.  As we continue to grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name and closeout products as major manufacturers seek a single buyer to acquire an entire deal. We plan to further invest in our merchandising team in order to expand and enhance our sourcing relationships and product categories, which we expect will drive shopping frequency and increase customer spending.
 
Leverage and expand Ollie’s Army.  We intend to recruit new Ollie’s Army members and increase their frequency of store visits and spending by enhancing our distinctive, fun and recognizable marketing programs, building brand awareness, further rewarding member loyalty and utilizing more sophisticated data-driven targeted marketing. We believe these strategies, coupled with a larger store base, will enable us to increase the amount of sales driven by loyal Ollie’s Army customers seeking the next great deal.

Our merchandise
 
Strategy
 
We offer a highly differentiated, constantly evolving assortment of brand name merchandise across a broad range of categories at drastically reduced prices. Our ever-changing assortment of “Good Stuff Cheap” includes brand name and closeout merchandise from leading manufacturers. We augment our brand name merchandise with opportunistic purchases of unbranded goods and our own domestic and direct-import private label brands in underpenetrated categories to further enhance the assortment of products that we offer. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented approximately 65% and non-closeout goods and private label products collectively represented approximately 35% of the retail value of our 2022 merchandise purchases.  We believe our compelling value proposition and the unique nature of our merchandise offerings have fostered our customer appeal across a variety of demographics and socioeconomic profiles.
 
Our warehouse format stores feature a broad number of categories including housewares, bed and bath, food, floor coverings, health and beauty aids, books and stationery, toys, and electronics as well as other products including hardware, candy, clothing, sporting goods, pet and lawn and garden products. We focus on buying cheap to sell cheap and source products as unique buying opportunities present themselves. Our merchandise mix is designed to combine unique and brand name bargains at extremely attractive price points. This approach results in frequently changing product assortments and localized offerings which encourage shopper frequency and a “shop now” sense of urgency as customers hunt to discover the next deal.
 
The common element of our dynamic merchandise selection is the consistent delivery of great deals to our customers, with products offered at prices up to 70% below department stores and fancy stores and up to 20-50% below mass market retailers. Our product price tags allow customers to compare our competitor’s price against Ollie’s price to further highlight the savings they can realize by shopping at our stores.

Product categories
 
We maintain consistent average margins across our primary product categories described below.
 
Brand name and closeout merchandise
 
Brand name and closeout merchandise represented approximately 65% of the retail value of our 2022 merchandise purchases.  Our focus is to provide huge savings to our customers primarily through brand name products across a broad range of merchandise. Our experienced merchant team purchases deeply discounted, branded or closeout merchandise primarily from manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and brokers. This merchandise includes overstocks, discontinued merchandise, package changes, cancelled orders, excess inventory and buybacks from retailers, and major manufacturers.
 


 Index

Non-closeout goods/private label
 
Non-closeout and private label products collectively represented approximately 35% of the retail value of our 2022 merchandise purchases.  We augment the breadth of our brand name merchandise with non-closeout and private label merchandise. In categories where the consumer is not as brand conscious, such as food, home textiles, and furniture, or when we may not be offering a current brand name merchandise deal, we will buy deeply discounted unbranded merchandise. These extreme value offerings are mixed in the stores with our brand name merchandise. We also have a variety of domestic and direct-import private label merchandise and exclusive products sold under numerous brands. These high quality products are developed in key categories such as housewares and are designed to create brand-like excitement and complement our brand name merchandise. We also have licenses for private label products that use recognizable celebrity names or brand names. We routinely evaluate the quality and condition of these private label goods to ensure that we are delivering our customer a high quality product at a great price.
 
Merchandise procurement and distribution
 
Our disciplined buying strategy and strict adherence to purchasing margins support our merchandising strategy of buying cheap to sell cheap.
 
Merchandising team
 
Our merchant team maintains strong, long-standing relationships with a diverse group of suppliers, allowing us to procure branded merchandise at compelling values for our customers.  Our merchants specialize by department in order to build category expertise, in-depth knowledge and sourcing relationships. We believe our buying approach, coupled with long-standing and newly formed relationships, enable us to find the best deals from major manufacturers and pass drastically reduced prices along to our customers. We plan to further invest in and grow our merchandising team in order to expand and enhance our sourcing relationships and product categories, which we expect will drive shopping frequency and increase customer spending.
 
Merchandise procurement
 
We believe that our strong sourcing capabilities are the result of our tenured merchant team’s ability to leverage deep, long-standing relationships with hundreds of manufacturers, wholesalers, brokers, retailers, and other suppliers. Our merchants maintain direct relationships with brand manufacturers, regularly attend major tradeshows and travel the world to source extreme value offerings across a broad assortment of product categories. We are an ideal partner to major manufacturers because our merchants are experienced and empowered to make quick decisions. Each opportunity is unique, and our merchants negotiate directly with the supplier to lock in a particular deal. Our ability to select the most attractive opportunistic purchases from a growing number of available deals enables us to provide a wide assortment of goods to our customers at great bargain prices.
 
We source from over 1,100 suppliers. Our dedication to building strong relationships with suppliers is evidenced by an average relationship of over 15-years with our top 15 suppliers. As we continue to grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name products since many major manufacturers seek a single buyer to acquire the entire deal.
 
Distribution and logistics
 
We have made significant investments in our distribution network and personnel to support our store growth plan. Currently, we distribute approximately 95% of our merchandise from our distribution centers in York, PA (603,000 square feet), Commerce, GA (962,000 square feet), and Lancaster, TX (615,000 square feet). We are in the process of expanding our York, PA distribution center, which will provide an additional 201,000 square feet of distribution capacity, and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. In order to minimize the amount of time our retail stores devote to inventory management, our merchandise is seeded with price tickets and labeled with a bar code for shipping.
 


 Index

On October 17, 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a parcel of land in Princeton, Illinois for the construction of our fourth distribution center. The purchase agreement is subject to customary post-execution, pre-closing activities with an anticipated closing date in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
 
Our stores generally receive shipments from our distribution centers one to two times a week, depending on the season and specific store size and sales volume. We utilize independent third party freight carriers.
 
With the expansion of our York, PA distribution center and the addition of our fourth distribution center, we believe our distribution capabilities will support over 700 stores.
 
Our stores
 
As of January 28, 2023, we operated 468 stores, averaging approximately 33,000 square feet, across 29 contiguous states in the eastern half of the United States. Our highly flexible real estate approach has proven successful across all vintages, geographic regions, population densities, demographic groups, real estate formats and regardless of any co-tenant. Our business model has resulted in positive financial performance during strong and weak economic cycles. We have successfully opened stores in six new states since 2018, highlighting the portability of our new store model. The following map shows the number of stores in each of the states in which we operated as of January 28, 2023:
 

Store design and layout
 
All of our warehouse format stores incorporate the same philosophy: no-frills, bright, “semi-lovely” stores and a fun, treasure hunt shopping experience. We present our stores as “semi-lovely” to differentiate our stores from other traditional retailers, and to minimize operating and build-out costs. Our stores also welcome our customers with vibrant and colorful caricatures together with witty signage. We attempt to make our customers laugh as we poke fun at ourselves and current events. We believe that by disarming our customers by getting them to giggle a bit, they are able to look at and trust our products for what they are—extremely great bargains.
 


 Index

We believe the store layout and merchandising strategy help to encourage a “shop now” sense of urgency and increase frequency of customer visits as customers never know what they might come across in our stores. We make it easy for our customers to browse our stores by displaying our frequently changing assortment of products on rolling tables, pallets and other display fixtures. Our store team leaders are responsible for maintaining our treasure hunt shopping experience, keeping the stores clean and well-lit and ensuring our customers are engaged.  We believe our humorous brand image, compelling values and welcoming stores resonate with our customers and define Ollie’s as a unique and comfortable destination shopping location.
 
Expansion opportunities and site selection
 
We believe we can profitably expand our store count on a national scale to more than 1,050 locations based on internal estimates and third party research conducted by Hoffman Strategy Group. Our disciplined real estate strategy focuses on infilling existing geographies as well as expanding into contiguous markets in order to leverage our distribution infrastructure, field management team, store management, marketing investments and brand awareness.
 
We maintain a pipeline of real estate sites that have been approved by our real estate committee. Our recent store growth is summarized in the following table:
 

 | 2022 | | | 2021 | | 2020
---------------------------------+------+-----+---+------+-----+-----
Stores open at beginning of year | | 431 | | | 388 | | 345 | 
Stores opened | | 40 | | | 46 | | 47 | 
Stores closed | | (3 | ) | | (3 | ) | (4 | )
Stores open at end of year | | 468 | | | 431 | | 388 | 

 
We utilize a rigorous site selection and real estate approval process in order to leverage our infrastructure, marketing investments and brand awareness. Members of our real estate team spend considerable time evaluating prospective sites before bringing a new lease proposal to our real estate committee, which is comprised of senior management and executive officers. Our flexible store layout allows us to quickly take over a variety of low-cost, second-generation sites, including former big box retail and grocery stores.
 
We believe there is an ample supply of suitable low-cost, second-generation real estate allowing us to infill within our existing markets as well as to expand into new, contiguous geographies. By focusing on key characteristics such as proximity to the nearest Ollie’s store, ability to leverage distribution infrastructure, visibility, traffic counts, population densities of at least 50,000 people within ten miles and low rent per square foot, we have developed a new store real estate model that has consistently delivered attractive returns on invested capital.
 
Our strong unit growth is supported by our predictable and compelling new store model. We target a store size between 25,000 to 35,000 square feet and an average initial cash investment of approximately $1.0 million,  which includes store fixtures and equipment, store-level and distribution center inventory (net of payables) and pre-opening expenses. With our relatively low investment costs and strong new store opening performance, we target first-year annual new store sales of approximately $4.0 million.  New stores opened from 2017 to 2021 have generated an average of $4.6 million in net sales in their first full year of operations and produced an average payback period of approximately two years. We believe that our consistent store performance, corporate infrastructure, including our distribution centers, and disciplined approach to site selection support the portability and predictability of our new unit growth strategy.

Store-level management and training
 
Our Vice President of Store Operations oversees all store activities. Our stores are grouped into five regions, divided generally along geographic lines. We employ regional directors, who have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the stores in their region. Reporting to the regional directors are district team leaders and market team leaders who each manage a group of stores in their markets. At the store level, the leadership team consists of a store team leader (manager), co-team leader (first level assistant manager) and assistant team leader (second level assistant manager). Supervisors oversee specific areas within each store.
 
Each store team leader is responsible for the daily operations of the store, including the processing of merchandise to the sales floor and the presentation of goods throughout the store. Store team leaders are trained to maintain a clean and appealing store environment for our customers. Store team leaders and co-team leaders are also responsible for the hiring, training, and development of associates.
 
We work tirelessly to hire talented people, to improve our ability to assess talent during the interview process and to regularly train those individuals at Ollie’s who are responsible for interviewing candidates. We also devote substantial resources to training our new managers through our Team Leader Training Program. This program operates at designated training stores located across our footprint. It provides an in-depth review of our operations, including merchandising, policies and procedures, asset protection and safety, and human resources. Part-time associates receive structured training as part of their onboarding.
 
For additional information on store-level management training and initiatives by the Company, see the discussion of Human Capital below.
 
Marketing and advertising
 
Our marketing and advertising campaigns feature colorful caricatures and witty sayings in order to make our customers laugh. We believe that by disarming our customers by getting them to giggle a bit, they are able to look at and trust our products for what they are—extremely great bargains. Our distinctive and often self-deprecating humor and highly recognizable caricatures are used in all of our stores, flyers and advertising campaigns.
 
We tailor our marketing mix and strategy for each market, deal or promotion. We primarily use the following forms of marketing and advertising:
 

• | Print and direct mail: During 2022, we distributed over 700 million highly recognizable flyers. Our flyers are distributed 22 times per year and serve as the foundation of our marketing strategy. They highlight current deals to create shopping urgency and drive traffic and increase frequency of store visits; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Television and radio: We selectively utilize creative television and radio advertising campaigns in targeted markets at certain times of the year, particularly during the holiday sales season, to create brand awareness and support new store openings; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Charity and community events: We are dedicated to maintaining a visible presence in the communities in which our stores are located through the sponsorship of charitable organizations such as Feeding America, Toys for Tots, Children’s Miracle Network, Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, and the Kevin Harvick Foundation. We believe supporting these organizations promotes our brand, underscores our values and builds a sense of community; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Digital marketing and social media: We maintain an active online presence and promote our brand through our website, our mobile app and social media channels. We also utilize targeted email marketing to highlight our latest brand name offerings and drive traffic to our stores. In addition, we invest in digital marketing where we target both our current and prospective customers.

Ollie’s Army
 
Our customer loyalty program, Ollie’s Army, stands at 13.2 million members as of January 28, 2023, an increase of 4.8% from 2021. In 2022, Ollie’s Army members accounted for over 80% of net sales and spent approximately 40% more per shopping trip, on average, than non-members.  Consistent with our marketing strategy, we engage new and existing Ollie’s Army members through the use of witty phrases and signage; examples include “Enlist in Ollie’s Army today,” “become one of the few, the cheap, the proud” and “Ollie’s Army Boot Camp…all enlistees will receive 15% off their next purchase.” Throughout the year, for every $250 Ollie’s Army members spend, they receive a coupon for 10% off their next entire purchase.  Ollie’s Army ‘ranks’ are another savings opportunity for members.  For the first $250 and $500 members spend in a calendar year, they receive a coupon for 20% and 30% off of one item, respectively.  Historically, Ollie’s Army members have demonstrated high redemption rates for promotional activities exclusive to Ollie’s Army members, such as our Valentine’s, Boot Camp, and 15% off holiday mailers. In addition, Ollie’s Army members have historically enthusiastically responded to Ollie’s Army Night, an annual one-day after-hours sale in December exclusively for members.  We expect to continue leveraging the data gathered from our proprietary database of Ollie’s Army members to better segment and target our marketing initiatives and increase shopping frequency.
Competition
 
We compete with a diverse group of retailers, including discount, closeout, mass merchant, department, grocery, drug, convenience, hardware, variety, online, and other specialty stores.
 
The principal basis on which we compete against other retailers is by offering an ever-changing selection of brand name products at compelling price points in an exciting shopping environment. Accordingly, we compete against a fragmented group of retailers, wholesalers, and jobbers to acquire merchandise for sale in our stores.
 
Our established relationships with our suppliers, coupled with our scale, associated buying power, financial credibility and responsiveness, often makes Ollie’s the first call for available deals. Our direct relationships with suppliers have increased as we have grown, and we continuously strive to broaden our supplier network.
 
Trademarks and other intellectual property
 
We own multiple state and federally registered trademarks related to our brand, including “Ollie’s,” “Ollie’s Bargain Outlet,” “Good Stuff Cheap,” “Ollie’s Army,” “Real Brands Real Cheap!,” and “Real Brands! Real Bargains!,” among others. In addition, we maintain a federal trademark for the image of Ollie, the face of our company. We also own registered trademarks for many of our private labels such as “Sarasota Breeze,” “Steelton Tools,” “American Way,” and “Middleton Home,” among others.  We routinely prosecute trademarks where appropriate, both for private label goods and to further identify our goods and services. We enter into trademark license agreements as necessary, which may include our private label offerings, such as the Magnavox products available in our stores. Our trademark registrations have various expiration dates; however, assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed, they have a perpetual duration. We also own several domain names, including www.ollies.us, www.ollies.com, www.olliesbargainoutlet.com, www.olliesarmy.com, www.ollies.cheap, www.sarasotabreeze.com and www.olliesmail.com, and unregistered copyrights in our website content. We attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks and other intellectual property as practical and pursue infringement of those marks when appropriate.

Technology
 
Our management information systems provide a full range of business process assistance and timely information to support our merchandising team and strategy, management of multiple distribution centers, stores and operations, and financial reporting. We believe our current systems provide us with operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and respond to merchandising and operating trends in our business. We use a combination of internal and external resources to support store point-of-sale, merchandise acquisition and distribution, inventory management, financial reporting, real estate, and administrative functions. We continuously assess ways to maximize productivity and efficiency, as well as evaluate opportunities to further enhance our existing systems. Our existing systems are scalable to support future growth.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to state and federal laws including labor and employment laws, including minimum wage requirements and wage and hour laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations, environmental laws and regulations, and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and/or govern product standards, the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws.
 
We source a portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our vendor code of conduct mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.
 
Human Capital
 
 Attracting, developing, and retaining quality talent is key to our growth, and our success depends on cultivating an engaged and motivated workforce.  We work hard to create an environment where Ollie’s team members can build fulfilling careers and we take pride in providing opportunities for growth and development.
 
We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective talents, striving to ensure that all associates are treated with dignity and respect.  We believe that a workforce with a diversity of viewpoints, background, experience and industry knowledge, as well as more traditional characteristics of diversity, such as race and gender, are key to our culture and long-term success.  We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities and advancement consideration to all individuals based on job-related qualifications and ability to perform the job as well as maintaining an environment that is free of intimidation or harassment.  We value the talents and contributions of our associates and by focusing on our team members we know that the entire Ollie’s community will be well served.
 
Oversight and Management
 
Our Human Resources department manages all associate matters, including recruiting, hiring, compensation and benefits, performance management, and associate training. In addition, our management team works closely with the Human Resources department to evaluate associate management issues such as retention and workplace safety. As we strive to retain and engage talent at all levels of our business, our Human Resources department also reviews our retention and turnover rates and administers our talent and training programs and review process to support the development of our talent pipeline.

Associates
 
As of January 28, 2023, we employed over 10,700 associates, approximately 4,900 of whom were full-time and approximately 5,800 of whom were part-time. Of our total associate base, approximately 900 were based at our store support center and distribution centers, and the remaining were store and field associates. The number of associates in a fiscal year fluctuates depending on the business needs at different times of the year. As of January 28, 2023, approximately 60% of our workforce is self-identified female and approximately 40% is self-identified male. Over 38% of our workforce has self-identified as having a racial or ethnic minority background.  None of our associates belong to a union or are party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement.
 
Associate Training and Development Programs
 
 We offer a compelling work environment with meaningful growth and career-development opportunities. This starts with the opportunity to do challenging work and learn on the job and is supplemented by programs and continuous learning that help our team build skills to advance.  We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.  We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our high-potential team members for greater responsibility. Our current team of district managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six and four years, respectively.  We believe internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives.
 
Our Ollie’s Leadership Institute (“OLI”) is a program that is used to equip field associates with the ability to advance their career. Each OLI participant receives an individual development plan, designed to prepare them for their next level position. Reflecting our belief in our “home grown” talent, OLI is our preferred source for new supervisors and team leaders.  In 2022, over 45% of our current district team leaders were internally promoted to their position.  Company-wide, over 60% of our field positions were filled by internal promotions. We believe our training and development programs help create a positive work environment and result in stores that operate at a high level.
 
Compensation and Benefits
 
 We are committed to providing market-competitive compensation for all positions. Eligible team members participate in one of our various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon store and/or Company performance. In addition, we provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan with a Company-sponsored match. We also share in the cost of health insurance provided to eligible team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased from the Company. We additionally provide our team members with paid time off.
 
Workplace Health and Safety
 
Maintaining a safe and secure work environment is very important to us and we conduct our business in an environmentally sound manner based on customer needs and local requirements.   To further promote a safe work environment, we have established safety training programs. This includes administering an occupational injury- and illness-prevention program, together with an employee assistance program for team members.
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter due to the holiday sales season.  To prepare for the holiday sales season, we must order and keep in stock more merchandise than we carry during other times of the year and generally engage in additional marketing efforts.  We expect inventory levels, along with accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in our third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of increased net sales during the holiday sales season.  As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales and working capital requirements during the year.  Because we offer a broad selection of merchandise at extreme values, we believe we are generally less impacted than other retailers by economic cycles, which correspond with declines in general consumer spending habits and we believe we still benefit from periods of increased consumer spending.
