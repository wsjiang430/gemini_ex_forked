Item 1. Business
The Company
Science Applications International Corporation (herein referred to as “SAIC,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading provider of technical, engineering and enterprise information technology (IT) services primarily to the U.S. government. We provide engineering, systems integration and information technology offerings for large, complex government projects and offer a broad range of services with a targeted emphasis on higher-end, differentiated technology services. Our end-to-end enterprise IT offerings span the entire spectrum of our customers' IT infrastructure. We commenced operations on September 27, 2013 (the Distribution Date) following completion of a spin-off transaction from our former parent, Leidos Holdings, Inc. (collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, “former Parent”). On January 14, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Engility Holdings, Inc. (collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Engility"), which provides increased customer and market access, as well as increased scale in strategic business areas of national interest, such as defense, federal civilian agencies, intelligence and space. On May 4, 2015 we completed the acquisition of privately held Scitor Holdings, Inc. (Scitor), a leading provider of services to the intelligence community, which enabled us to gain sufficient scale to competitively pursue opportunities within the intelligence community. 
Our business has a long and successful history, tracing its roots to the earliest days of former Parent which was founded in 1969 as a scientific research and engineering firm. The U.S. federal government agencies we serve include all branches of the U.S. military (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard), U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), U.S. Department of State, Department of Justice and several sensitive intelligence community agencies. Our long-standing customer relationships have enabled us to achieve an in-depth understanding of our customers’ missions and provide differentiated service offerings to meet our customers’ most complex requirements. Our offerings include: engineering; technology and equipment platform integration; maintenance of ground and maritime systems; logistics; training and simulation; operation and program support services; and end-to-end services spanning the design, development, integration, deployment, management and operations, sustainment and security of our customers’ entire IT infrastructure. We serve our customers through approximately 2,200 active contracts and task orders. We have more than 23,000 employees that are led by an experienced executive team of proven industry leaders.
Our core strengths have supported our successful performance on programs of national importance. Those strengths include:
Enduring Customer Relationships and Mission-Orientation. We have strong and long-lasting customer relationships throughout the U.S. government. Our track record of serving the missions of our government customer spans decades, including several enduring customer relationships that have lasted 20 years or more. Our employees, many of whom are deployed at customer sites, work closely with our customers in fulfilling their missions. Our strong customer relationships enable us to develop deep customer knowledge and translate our mission understanding into successful program execution that fosters continued demand for our services.
Full Life Cycle Offerings. We integrate technologies and deliver services that provide our customers with seamless end-to-end solutions. Our expertise includes initial requirements definition, development and integration services, training, logistics and sustainment. These full life cycle offerings, combined with deep customer knowledge, allow us to more effectively support our customers’ missions.
Significant Scale and Diversified Contract Base. With approximately $4.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019, we are one of the largest pure-play technical service providers to the U.S. government. Our significant scale advantage enables us to serve as a prime systems integrator on large, complex programs and to allocate resources toward further developing and expanding our repeatable, proven solutions and differentiated technical capabilities. Our diversified revenue base consists of programs ranging from research and development to operations and maintenance.

Regulation
Our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations, including Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. These regulations set forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government and impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting and include procurement, import and export, security, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. In addition, these regulations govern contract pricing and reimbursable costs by, among other things, requiring certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations, defining allowable and unallowable costs, and otherwise governing the right to reimbursement under various flexibly priced contracts. These laws and regulations impose specific cost accounting practices that may increase accounting and internal control costs associated with compliance with government standards. The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. Our compliance with these regulations is monitored by the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Defense Contract Audit Agency.
The U.S. government has the ability to cancel contracts at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and contract profit for work performed when the U.S. government issues a termination for convenience.
Some of our operations and service offerings involve our access to and use of personally identifiable information and protected health information, which activities are regulated by extensive federal and state privacy and data security laws requiring organizations to provide certain privacy protections and security safeguards for such information.
Internationally, we are subject to foreign government laws and regulations, and U.S. government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices (including laws and regulations relating to bribery of foreign government officials, import and export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings). We are also susceptible to varying political and economic risks.
In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, we have established policies and procedures that address our approach to meeting these requirements and also administer a robust ethics and compliance training program to maintain a compliance-oriented workforce.
These regulations and risks affecting our business are described in more detail under “Risk Factors” in this report.
Contracts
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. The U.S. government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives. Budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have increasingly caused many U.S. government agencies to purchase services and solutions using contracting processes that give them the ability to select multiple winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to provide various services or solutions on established general terms and conditions rather than through single award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. government agencies procure services and solutions include the following:
Single Award Contracts. U.S. government agencies may procure services and solutions through single award contracts which specify the scope of work that will be delivered and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services. When an agency has a requirement, interested contractors are solicited, qualified and then provided with a request for proposal. The process of qualifying prospective bidders, soliciting proposals and evaluating contractor bids requires the agency to maintain a large, professional procurement staff and the bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete. This method of contracting may provide the contractor with greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of work from the single successful awardee.

Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts. The U.S. government uses IDIQ contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or solutions on pre-established terms and conditions. The U.S. government then issues task orders under the IDIQ contracts to purchase the specific services or solutions it needs. IDIQ contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process. Under a single award IDIQ contract, all task orders under that contract are awarded to one pre-selected contractor. Under a multi-award IDIQ contract, task orders can be awarded to any of the pre-selected contractors, which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders. Multi-award IDIQ contracts that are open for any government agency to use for the procurement of services are commonly referred to as “government-wide acquisition contracts.” IDIQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts that enable, but not commit, the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of services or solutions from one or more contractors. At the time an IDIQ contract is awarded (prior to the letting of any task orders), a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or solutions that the U.S. government will purchase under the contract, and, in the case of a multi-award IDIQ, the contractor from which such purchases may be made.
U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule Contracts. The GSA maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and solutions with pre-negotiated prices for use throughout the U.S. government. In order for a company to provide services under a GSA Schedule contract, a company must be pre-qualified and awarded a contract by the GSA. When an agency uses a GSA Schedule to meet its requirements, the agency (or the GSA on behalf of the agency) conducts the procurement and bidders are limited to GSA Schedule-qualified contractors. GSA Schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs. Similar to IDIQ contracts, at the time a GSA Schedule contract is awarded, a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or solutions that customers will ultimately purchase under the contract.
Contract Types
Generally, the type of contract used for the acquisition of our services and solutions is determined by or negotiated with the U.S. government and may depend on certain factors, including: the type and complexity of the work to be performed; degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance; the extent of price competition; and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals. We generate revenues under several types of contracts, including the following:

• | Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee (contract profit). This type of contract is generally used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement contracts usually subject us to lower risk and generally require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and amount of costs.


• | Time-and-materials (T&M) contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs. This type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty of the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. On T&M contracts, we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over their period of performance.


• | Firm-fixed price (FFP) contracts provide for a predetermined price for specific solutions. These contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs than planned. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to reduced profits or losses from increased or unexpected costs.

Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or solutions provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is finally determined. Given the relative amount of risk assumed by the contractor, cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts. For the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for the last three fiscal years, see “Other Key Performance Measures—Contract Types” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this report.

Selected Financial Data
See “Selected Financial Data” in Part II of this report.
Backlog
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. Our backlog consists of funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog. At February 1, 2019 and February 2, 2018 our total backlog was $13.8 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. For a complete description of our backlog, see “Other Key Performance Measures—Net Bookings and Backlog” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this report.
Competition
Competition for contracts is intense and we often compete against a large number of established multinational companies which may have greater name recognition, financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. We also compete against smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas, as well as the U.S. government’s own capabilities. As a result of the diverse requirements of the U.S. government, we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations. Our principal competitors include the following:

• | the engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors that provide IT services in addition to other hardware systems and products, which include companies such as General Dynamics Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Raytheon Company;


• | contractors focused principally on technical and IT services, such as Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., CACI International, Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc., ManTech International Corporation, Serco Group plc, and Perspecta, Inc.;


• | diversified commercial providers that also provide U.S. government IT services, such as Accenture plc, International Business Machines Corporation and Unisys Corporation; and


• | contractors providing supply chain management and other logistics services, such as Agility Logistics Corporation

We compete on various factors, which include: our technical expertise and qualified and/or security-cleared personnel; our ability to deliver innovative cost-effective solutions in a timely manner; successful program execution on previous programs; our reputation and standing with customers; pricing; and the size and geographic presence of our Company.
Competition within the government services industry has intensified which has led to fewer sole-source awards and an increased emphasis on cost competitiveness and affordability. In addition, procurement initiatives to improve efficiency, refocus priorities and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole, which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs.
Patents and Proprietary Information
Our technical services and solutions are not generally dependent on patent protection, although we do selectively seek patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our solutions, software programs, methodologies and know-how. This proprietary information is protected by copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, contracts and other means. We selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties.
In connection with the performance of services, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. Generally, the U.S. government may disclose or license such information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. In the case of some subcontracts that we perform, the prime contractor may also have certain rights to the programs and solutions that we develop under the subcontract.

Research and Development
For information related to our research and development activities, see Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report.
Seasonality
The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends on September 30. It is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. In addition, revenues may be unfavorably impacted during our fourth fiscal quarter due to a greater number of holidays and higher utilization of vacation time. For selected quarterly financial data, see Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we do not currently anticipate that compliance costs or the liabilities associated with environmental laws will materially and adversely affect us, we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future. These regulations and risks are described in more detail under “Risk Factors” in this report.
