Item 1.  Business
General
 The Company
 Sierra Bancorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation headquartered in Porterville, California, and is a registered bank holding company under federal banking laws.  The Company was formed to serve as the holding company for Bank of the Sierra (the “Bank”), and has been the Bank’s sole shareholder since August 2001.  The Company exists primarily for the purpose of holding the stock of the Bank and of such other subsidiaries it may acquire or establish.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s only other subsidiaries were Sierra Statutory Trust II, Sierra Capital Trust III, and Coast Bancorp Statutory Trust II, which were formed solely to facilitate the issuance of capital trust pass-through securities (“TRUPS”).  Pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) standard on the consolidation of variable interest entities, these trusts are not reflected on a consolidated basis in the financial statements of the Company.  References herein to the “Company” include Sierra Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiary, the Bank, unless the context indicates otherwise.  At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated assets of $2.523 billion (including gross loans of $1.732 billion), liabilities totaling $2.249 billion (including deposits of $2.116 billion), and shareholders’ equity of $273 million.  The Company’s liabilities include $35 million in debt obligations due to its trust subsidiaries, related to TRUPS issued by those entities.
The Bank
 Bank of the Sierra, a California state-chartered bank headquartered in Porterville, California, offers a wide range of retail and commercial banking services via branch offices located throughout California’s South San Joaquin Valley, the Central Coast, Ventura County, and neighboring communities.  The Bank was incorporated in September 1977, and opened for business in January 1978 as a one-branch bank with $1.5 million in capital.  Our growth in the ensuing years has largely been organic in nature, but includes four whole-bank acquisitions:  Sierra National Bank in 2000, Santa Clara Valley Bank in 2014, Coast National Bank in 2016, and Ojai Community Bank in October 2017.  See the Recent Developments section below for details on our latest acquisitions.
 There are not currently any plans for additional branches, but our post-recession branching activity includes the establishment of the Fresno-Palm branch and the purchase of the Lompoc branch in 2018, opening de novo branches in Bakersfield and Pismo Beach and the acquisition of the Woodlake branch in 2017, opening a new branch in Sanger in 2016, the relocation of our Clovis branch to a superior location in 2012, and the opening of a de novo branch in the City of Selma in 2011.  With our latest acquisitions and branching activity, the Bank now maintains administrative offices and operates 40 full-service branches in the following California locations:

Complementing the Bank’s stand-alone offices are specialized lending units which include our agricultural credit center and an SBA lending division.  We also have ATMs at all branch locations and seven non-branch locations.  Furthermore, the Bank is a member of the Allpoint network, which provides our deposit customers with surcharge-free access to over 43,000 ATMs across the nation and another 12,000 ATMs in foreign countries, and customers have access to electronic point-of-sale payment alternatives nationwide via the Pulse network.  To ensure that account access preferences are addressed for all customers, we provide the following options:  an internet branch which provides the ability to open deposit accounts online; an online banking option with bill-pay and mobile banking capabilities, including mobile check deposit; online lending solutions for consumers and small businesses; a customer service center that is accessible by toll-free telephone during business hours; and an automated telephone banking system that is usually accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  We offer a variety of other banking products and services to complement and support our lending and deposit products, including remote deposit capture and payroll services for business customers.
 Our chief products and services relate to extending loans and accepting deposits.  Our lending activities cover real estate, commercial (including small business), mortgage warehouse, agricultural, and consumer loans.  The bulk of our real estate loans are secured by commercial, professional office and agricultural properties, but we also offer commercial construction loans and multifamily credit facilities among other types of loans.  As noted above, gross loans totaled $1.732 billion at December 31, 2018, and the percentage of our total loan and lease portfolio for each of the principal types of credit we extend was as follows: (i) loans secured by real estate (84.0%); (ii) agricultural production loans (2.8%); (iii) commercial and industrial loans and leases (including SBA loans and direct finance leases) (7.4%); (iv) mortgage warehouse loans (5.3%); and (v) consumer loans (0.5%).  Interest, fees, and other income on real-estate secured loans, which is by far the largest segment of our portfolio, totaled $73.0 million, or 64% of net interest plus other income in 2018, and $53.3 million, or 55% of net interest plus other income in 2017.
 In addition to loans, we offer a wide range of deposit products and services for individuals and businesses including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market demand accounts, time deposits, retirement accounts, and sweep accounts.  The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) up to maximum insurable amounts.  We attract deposits throughout our market area via referrals from other customers, direct-mail campaigns, a customer-oriented product mix, and competitive pricing, and by offering convenient locations, drive-through banking, and various other delivery channels.  We strive to retain our deposit customers by providing a consistently high level of service.  At December 31, 2018, the consolidated Company had 122,500 deposit accounts totaling $2.116 billion, compared to 118,700 deposit accounts totaling $1.988 billion at December 31, 2017.
 We have not engaged in any material research activities related to the development of new products or services during the last two fiscal years.  However, our officers and employees are continually searching for ways to increase public convenience, enhance customer access to payment systems, and enable us to improve our competitive position.  The 
 3

cost to the Bank for these development, operations, and marketing activities cannot be calculated with any degree of certainty.  We hold no patents or licenses (other than licenses required by bank regulatory agencies), franchises, or concessions.  Our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural orientation of the Central Valley, but as our branch network has expanded to include more metropolitan areas we have become less reliant on the agriculture-related base.  We are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our core deposits, but our time deposit balances at December 31, 2018 include $120 million in deposits from the State of California, comprising 6% of total deposits.  Furthermore, for loans we have what could be considered to be concentrations in loans to the dairy industry (8% of total loans), and the hotel industry (9% of total loans).  Our efforts to comply with government and regulatory mandates on consumer protection and privacy, anti-terrorism, and other initiatives have resulted in significant ongoing expense to the Bank, including compliance staffing costs and other expenses associated with compliance-related software.  However, as far as can be determined there has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of environmental regulation at the Federal, state, or local level. The Company is not involved with chemicals or toxins that might have an adverse effect on the environment, thus its primary exposure to environmental legislation is through lending activities.  The Company’s lending procedures include steps to identify and monitor this exposure in an effort to avoid any related loss or liability.
 Recent Developments
 On May 18, 2018, the Company purchased most of the deposits of the Lompoc branch of Community Bank of Santa Maria, located in Santa Barbara County.  The purchase also included the Lompoc branch building, the real property on which the building is located, and certain other equipment and fixed assets at their aggregate fair value of $1.7 million.  The Lompoc branch is now operating as a full-service branch of Bank of the Sierra.  Lompoc branch deposits totaled $38 million at the time of purchase, consisting of $32 million in non-maturity deposits and $6 million in time deposits. In accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded a $1.169 million deposit purchase premium in connection with the transaction and is amortizing that amount on a straight line basis over eight years. 
 On November 3, 2017 the Company acquired the Woodlake branch of Citizen’s Business Bank.  Woodlake branch deposits totaled approximately $27 million at the acquisition date, consisting largely of non-maturity deposits.  The acquisition also included the purchase of the Woodlake branch building, the real property on which the building is located, and certain other equipment and fixed assets at their aggregate fair value of $500,000.  In accordance with GAAP, the Company recorded $625,000 of goodwill and a $486,000 core deposit intangible in connection with the transaction.  The core deposit intangible is being amortized on a straight line basis over eight years.
 On October 1, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Ojai Community Bancorp, parent company to Ojai Community Bank (collectively referred to herein as “Ojai”), in exchange for $809,000 in cash and 1,376,431 shares of Sierra Bancorp stock.  Immediately thereafter, Ojai Community Bank was merged into Bank of the Sierra.  At the time of the acquisition, the fair value of Ojai’s loans and deposits totaled $218 million and $231 million, respectively.  In accordance with GAAP, the Company also recorded $18.5 million of goodwill and a $3.5 million core deposit intangible in connection with the transaction.  The core deposit intangible is being amortized on a straight line basis over eight years.  The conversion of Ojai’s core banking system to Bank of the Sierra’s core system took place on November 3, 2017.
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 Information on recent accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Competition
 The banking business in California is generally highly competitive, including in our market areas.  Continued consolidation within the banking industry has heightened competition in recent periods, following on the heels of a relatively large number of FDIC-assisted takeovers of failed banks and other acquisitions of troubled financial institutions in the aftermath of the Great Recession.  There are also a number of unregulated companies competing for business in our markets, with financial products targeted at profitable customer segments.  Many of those companies are able to compete across geographic boundaries and provide meaningful alternatives to banking products and services.  These competitive trends are likely to continue.
 4

With respect to commercial bank competitors, our business is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks that operate a large number of offices within our geographic footprint.  Based on June 30, 2018 FDIC combined market share data for the 31 cities within which the Company currently maintains branches, the largest portion of deposits belongs to Wells Fargo Bank with 21.1% of total combined deposits, followed by Bank of America (18.8%), JPMorgan Chase (10.9%), Union Bank (8.5%), and Rabobank (5.6%).  Bank of the Sierra ranks sixth on the 2018 market share list with 4.6% of total deposits.  In Tulare County, however, where the Bank was originally formed, we rank first for deposit market share with 20.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2018, and had the largest number of branch locations (13, including our online branch).  The larger banks noted above have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand.  They can also offer certain services that we do not provide directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions, and by virtue of their greater capitalization those banks have legal lending limits that are substantially higher than ours.  For loan customers whose needs exceed our legal lending limits, we typically arrange for the sale, or participation, of some of the balances to financial institutions that are not within our geographic footprint.
 In addition to other banks our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, asset management groups, mortgage banking firms and internet companies.  Innovative technologies have lowered traditional barriers of entry and enabled many of these companies to offer services that were previously considered traditional banking products, and we have witnessed increased competition from companies that circumvent the banking system by facilitating payments via the internet, mobile devices, prepaid cards, and other means.
 Strong competition for deposits and loans among financial institutions and non-banks alike affects interest rates and terms on which financial products are offered to customers.  Mergers between financial institutions have created additional pressures within the financial services industry to streamline operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues in order to remain competitive.  Competition is also impacted by federal and state interstate banking laws which permit banking organizations to expand into other states.  The relatively large California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions.
 For years we have countered rising competition by offering a broad array of products with flexibility in structure and terms that cannot always be matched by our competitors.  We also offer our customers community-oriented, personalized service, and rely on local promotional activity and personal contact by our employees.  As noted above, layered onto our traditional personal-contact banking philosophy are technology-driven initiatives that improve customer access and convenience.
 Employees
As of December 31, 2018 the Company had 468 full-time and 88 part-time employees.  On a full-time equivalent basis staffing stood at 541 at December 31, 2018, down from 556 at December 31, 2017.
 Regulation and Supervision
 Banks and bank holding companies are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations.  Most banking regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of shareholders.  The following is a summary of certain statutes, regulations and regulatory guidance affecting the Company and the Bank.  This summary is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes, regulations and guidance, all of which are subject to change in the future, nor does it fully address their effects and potential effects on the Company and the Bank.
 Regulation of the Company Generally
 The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries.  As a bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”), and is subject to supervision, regulation and inspection by the Federal Reserve Board.  The Company is also subject to certain provisions of the California Financial Code which are applicable to bank holding companies.  In addition, the Company is under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act 
 5

of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each administered by the SEC.  The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select market (“NASDAQ”) with “BSRR” as its trading symbol, and the Company is subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies.
 The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHC Act and is registered as such with the Federal Reserve Board.  A bank holding company is required to file annual reports and other information with the Federal Reserve regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.  In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, including securities brokerage services, investment advisory services, fiduciary services, and management advisory and data processing services, among others.  A bank holding company that also qualifies as and elects to become a “financial holding company” may engage in a broader range of activities that are financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve or Treasury regulations), such as securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and agency, and making merchant banking investments.  The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company but may do so at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time.
 The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than five percent of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company.  Acquisitions by the Bank are subject instead to the Bank Merger Act, which requires the prior approval of an acquiring bank’s primary federal regulator for any merger with or acquisition of another bank.  Acquisitions by both the Company and the Bank also require the prior approval of the California Department of Business Oversight (the “DBO”) pursuant to the California Financial Code.
 The Company and the Bank are deemed to be “affiliates” of each other and thus are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as well as related Federal Reserve Regulation W which impose both quantitative and qualitative restrictions and limitations on transactions between affiliates.  The Bank is also subject to laws and regulations requiring that all extensions of credit to our executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and related parties must, among other things, be made on substantially the same terms and follow credit underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Bank.
 Under certain conditions, the Federal Reserve has the authority to restrict the payment of cash dividends by a bank holding company as an unsafe and unsound banking practice, and may require a bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to purchasing or redeeming its own equity securities.  The Federal Reserve also has the authority to regulate the debt of bank holding companies.
 A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks and must commit resources as necessary to support such subsidiaries.  The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the holding company’s payment of dividends to the shareholders in such circumstances.
 Regulation of the Bank Generally
 As a state chartered bank, the Bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all its operations by the FDIC and to state regulation by the DBO.  The Bank is also subject to certain regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.
 Capital Adequacy Requirements
 The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, respectively, governing capital adequacy.  These agencies have adopted risk-based capital guidelines to provide a systematic analytical framework that imposes regulatory capital requirements based on differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, considers off-balance sheet exposures in evaluating capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.  Capital levels, as measured by these standards, are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions.
 6

Pursuant to the adoption of final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for all U.S. banks and bank holding companies with more than $500 million in assets, minimum regulatory requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank increased effective January 1, 2015.  Furthermore, a capital class known as Common Equity Tier 1 capital was established in addition to Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, and most financial institutions were given the option of a one-time election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) from regulatory capital.  The Company has exercised its option to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital.  The final rules also increased capital requirements for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk construction and real estate loans, certain past-due or nonaccrual loans, and certain exposures related to securitizations.  The final rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19, 2010 for inclusion in the Tier 1 capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion at December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital.  All of the Company’s trust preferred securities were issued prior to that date and continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital.  
 Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, less the following: disallowed goodwill and intangibles, disallowed deferred tax assets, and any insufficient additional capital to cover the deductions.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as the sum of core capital elements, less the following:  goodwill and other intangible assets, accumulated other comprehensive income, disallowed deferred tax assets, and certain other deductions.  The following items are defined as core capital elements:  (i) common shareholders’ equity; (ii) qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus (and, in the case of holding companies, senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program); (iii) minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries; and (iv) “restricted” core capital elements (which include qualifying trust preferred securities) up to 25% of all core capital elements.  Tier 2 capital includes the following supplemental capital elements: (i) allowance for loan and lease losses (but not more than 1.25% of an institution’s risk-weighted assets); (ii) perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital; (iii) hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments; and, (iv) term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock and related surplus.  The maximum amount of Tier 2 capital is capped at 100% of Tier 1 capital.  
 The final rules established a regulatory minimum of 4.5% for common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets (“Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio”), a minimum of 6.0% for Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets (“Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio” or “Tier 1 RBC Ratio”), a minimum of 8.0% for qualifying Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital to total risk weighted assets (“Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio” or “Total RBC Ratio”), and a minimum of 4.0% for the Leverage Ratio, which is defined as Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (quarterly average assets less the disallowed capital items noted above).  In addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards, the final rules also require a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer which was phased in over three years.  The capital conservation buffer was 0.625% for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, and 1.875% for 2018, and it became fully phased in at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets beginning on January 1, 2019.  Effective January 1, 2019, the buffer effectively raises the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 RBC Ratio to 8.5%, and the Total RBC Ratio to 10.5%.  Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases, and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to executive management.
 Based on our capital levels at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company and the Bank would have met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis.  For more information on the Company’s capital, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Capital Resources.  Risk-based capital ratio (“RBC”) requirements are discussed in greater detail in the following section.
 Prompt Corrective Action Provisions
 Federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more of the prescribed minimum capital ratios.  The federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories: “well capitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of 10%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 8%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 5%); “adequately capitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of 6%; Common Equity Tier 1 
 7

RBC Ratio of 4.5%; and Leverage Ratio of 4%); “undercapitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of less than 8%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 6%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4.5%; or Leverage Ratio of less than 4%); “significantly undercapitalized” (Total RBC Ratio of less than 6%; Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 4%; Common Equity Tier 1 RBC Ratio of less than 3%; or Leverage Ratio less than 3%); and “critically undercapitalized” (tangible equity to total assets less than or equal to 2%).  A bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice merits a downgrade, but no bank may be treated as “critically undercapitalized” unless its actual tangible equity to assets ratio warrants such treatment.  As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, both the Company and the Bank qualified as well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes.
 At each successively lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations.  For example, a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would cause the bank to be “undercapitalized.”  Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks, which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements (including a guarantee by the parent holding company, if any).  “Significantly undercapitalized” banks are subject to broad regulatory authority, including among other things capital directives, forced mergers, restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits, restrictions on asset growth and activities, and prohibitions on paying bonuses or increasing compensation to senior executive officers without FDIC approval.  Even more severe restrictions apply to “critically undercapitalized” banks.  Most importantly, except under limited circumstances, not later than 90 days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank.
 In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency.  Enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders, termination of insurance on deposits (in the case of a bank), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, formal and informal agreements, or removal and prohibition orders against “institution-affiliated” parties.
 Safety and Soundness Standards
 The federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions.  Those guidelines relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan underwriting and documentation, compensation, and liquidity and interest rate exposure.  In general, the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  If an institution fails to meet the requisite standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and could institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted or followed.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 Legislation and regulations enacted and implemented since 2008 in response to the U.S. economic downturn and financial industry instability continue to impact most institutions in the banking sector.  Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which was enacted in 2010, are now effective and have been fully implemented, including revisions to the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and a permanent increase in coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of barriers to interstate branching; and, required disclosures and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.  Additional actions taken to implement Dodd-Frank provisions include (i) final capital rules, (ii) a final rule to implement the so called Volcker rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities, and (iii) final rules and increased enforcement action by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (discussed further below in connection with consumer protection).
 Some aspects of Dodd-Frank are still subject to rulemaking, making it difficult to anticipate the ultimate financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial services industry more generally.  However, many provisions of Dodd-Frank are already affecting our operations and expenses, including but not limited to changes in FDIC assessments, the permitted payment of interest on demand deposits, and enhanced compliance requirements.  Some 
 8

of the rules and regulations promulgated or yet to be promulgated under Dodd-Frank will apply directly only to institutions much larger than ours, but could indirectly impact smaller banks, either due to competitive influences or because certain required practices for larger institutions may subsequently become expected “best practices” for smaller institutions.  We could see continued attention and resources devoted by the Company to ensure compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements engendered by Dodd-Frank. 
 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law.  The Act made significant changes that impact corporate taxation, including the reduction of the maximum federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limitations to certain tax deductions.  The reduced tax rate had a favorable impact on our tax expense beginning in 2018, as our blended marginal income tax rate dropped to 29.56% in 2018 from 42.05% in 2017.  The tax rate reduction also resulted in an adjustment to our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect their value to the Company at the lower federal tax rate of 21%, with such revaluation required in the period in which the legislation was enacted.  Subsequent to a detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities we reduced our net deferred tax asset by $2.710 million via a charge to our income tax provision in December 2017.
Deposit Insurance
 The Bank’s deposits are insured up to maximum applicable limits under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”).  In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a revised restoration plan to ensure that the DIF’s designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) reaches 1.35% of insured deposits by September 30, 2020, the deadline mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.  In August 2016 the FDIC announced that the DIF reserve ratio had surpassed 1.15% as of June 30, 2016 and assessment rates for most institutions were adjusted downward, but institutions with $10 billion or more in assets were assessed a quarterly surcharge which will continue until the reserve ratio reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35%.  Furthermore, the restoration plan proposed an increase in the DRR to 2% of estimated insured deposits as a long-term goal for the fund.  On September 30, 2018, the DIF ratio reached 1.36 percent.  Because the ratio exceeded 1.35 percent, two deposit insurance assessment changes occurred under FDIC regulations:  surcharges on large banks (total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more) ended, with the last surcharge on large banks being collected on December 28, 2018; and, banks with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion were awarded credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38 percent.  Bank of the Sierra is eligible for such credits, which could reduce our FDIC assessments in future periods.
 As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act provided for a permanent increase in FDIC deposit insurance per depositor from $100,000 to $250,000 retroactive to January 1, 2008.  Furthermore, effective in the second quarter of 2011, FDIC deposit insurance premium assessment rates were adjusted, and the assessment base was established as an institution’s total assets less tangible equity.  We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC deposit insurance.  If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and/or on the value of, or market for, our common stock.
 In addition to DIF assessments, banks have been required to pay quarterly assessments that are applied to the retirement of Financing Corporation bonds issued in the 1980’s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry.  The assessment amount fluctuates, but was 0.32 basis points of insured deposits for the fourth quarter of 2018.  The Financing Corporation bonds mature in September 2019, and a final assessment of 0.14 basis points of insured deposits is projected for March 2019.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The Bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) activities.  The CRA generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA further requires the agencies to consider a financial institution’s efforts in meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or the formation of

holding companies.  In measuring a bank’s compliance with its CRA obligations, the regulators utilize a performance-based evaluation system under which CRA ratings are determined by the bank’s actual lending, service, and investment performance, rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements.  In connection with its assessment of CRA performance, the FDIC assigns a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance.”  The Bank most recently received a satisfactory CRA assessment rating in January 2019.
 Privacy and Data Security
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Financial Modernization Act”), imposed requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy.  Financial institutions, however, are required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the Financial Modernization Act.  The Financial Modernization Act generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure.  The statute also directed federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, to establish standards for the security of consumer information, and requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually.
Overdrafts
 The Electronic Funds Transfer Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve’s Regulation E, governs transfers initiated through automated teller machines (“ATMs”), point-of-sale terminals, and other electronic banking services.  Regulation E prohibits financial institutions from assessing an overdraft fee for paying ATM and one-time point-of-sale debit card transactions, unless the customer affirmatively opts in to the overdraft service for those types of transactions.  The opt-in provision establishes requirements for clear disclosure of fees and terms of overdraft services for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.  The rule does not apply to other types of transactions, such as check, automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) and recurring debit card transactions.  Additionally, in November 2010 the FDIC issued its Overdraft Guidance on automated overdraft service programs, to ensure that a bank mitigates the risks associated with offering automated overdraft payment programs and complies with all consumer protection laws and regulations.
Consumer Financial Protection and Financial Privacy 
 Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) as an independent entity with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards.  The CFPB’s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services.  CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, including the Bank, although only banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB.  Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, are examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency.
 In January 2013, the CFPB issued final regulations governing consumer mortgage lending.  Certain rules which became effective in January 2014 impose additional requirements on lenders, including the directive that lenders need to ensure the ability of their borrowers to repay mortgages.  The CFPB also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans and a rule expanding the scope of the high-cost mortgage provision in the Truth in Lending Act.  The CFPB also issued final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that relate to mortgage servicing.  In November 2013 the CFPB issued a final rule on integrated and simplified mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which became effective in October 2015.
 The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices.  Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s:  (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests.

The Bank continues to be subject to numerous other federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers.  Those laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, and respective state-law counterparts to these laws, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices.  These and other laws require disclosures including the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Company’s ability to raise interest rates and otherwise subject the Company to substantial regulatory oversight.
 In addition, as is the case with all financial institutions, the Bank is required to maintain the privacy of its customers’ non-public, personal information.  Such privacy requirements direct financial institutions to:  (i) provide notice to customers regarding privacy policies and practices; (ii) inform customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties; and (iii) give customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to non-affiliated third parties.
 Identity Theft
 Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the “FACT Act”), the Bank is required to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft “red flags” in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of certain accounts.  Under the FACT Act, the Bank is required to adopt reasonable policies and procedures to (i) identify relevant red flags for covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; (ii) detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; (iii) respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and (iv) ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.  The Bank maintains a program to meet the requirements of the FACT Act and the Bank believes it is currently in compliance with these requirements.
Interstate Banking and Branching
 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Interstate Act”), together with Dodd-Frank, relaxed prior interstate branching restrictions under federal law by permitting, subject to regulatory approval, state and federally chartered commercial banks to establish branches in states where the laws permit banks chartered in such states to establish branches.  The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area.  Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition.  Dodd-Frank effectively eliminated the prohibition under California law against interstate branching through de novo establishment of California branches.  Interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located.  The Bank presently does not have any interstate branches.
 USA Patriot Act of 2001
 The impact of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) on financial institutions of all kinds has been significant and wide ranging.  The Patriot Act substantially enhanced anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, and required certain regulatory authorities to adopt rules that promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.  Under the Patriot Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions regarding specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers.  The Patriot Act also requires all financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs.  The Bank expanded its Bank Secrecy Act compliance staff and intensified due diligence procedures concerning the opening of new accounts to fulfill the anti-money laundering requirements of the Patriot Act, and also implemented systems and procedures to identify suspicious banking activity and report any such activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

Incentive Compensation
 In June 2010, the FRB and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to help ensure that banking organizations do not undermine their own safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking.  The guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization's board of directors.  The regulatory agencies will review, as part of their regular risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.”  Where appropriate, the regulatory agencies will take supervisory or enforcement action to address perceived deficiencies in an institution’s incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management, control, and governance processes.  The Company believes that it is in full compliance with the regulatory guidance on incentive compensation policies.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley mandates chief executive and chief financial officer certifications of periodic financial reports, additional financial disclosures concerning off-balance sheet items, and accelerated share transaction reporting for executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders.  In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley increased penalties for non-compliance with the Exchange Act.  SEC rules promulgated pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley impose obligations and restrictions on auditors and audit committees intended to enhance their independence from Management, and include extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules.
 Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations
 As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidelines on sound risk management practices with respect to a financial institution’s concentrations in commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending activities.  These guidelines were issued in response to the agencies’ concerns that rising CRE concentrations might expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the commercial real estate market.  The guidelines identify certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution’s CRE concentration risk.  The guidelines are designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans.  In general, the guidelines establish the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (1) the institution’s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total CRE loans as defined in the regulatory guidelines represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital, and the institution’s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 month period.  The Bank believes that the guidelines are applicable to it, as it has a relatively high concentration in CRE loans.  The Bank and its board of directors have discussed the guidelines and believe that the Bank’s underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are sufficient to address the guidelines.
Other Pending and Proposed Legislation
 Other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the Company, the Bank and the banking industry in general are pending, and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the United States Congress, the California legislature and other governmental bodies in the future.  Such proposals, if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject the Bank to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements.  In addition, the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation.  It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the Company or the Bank would be affected thereby.
