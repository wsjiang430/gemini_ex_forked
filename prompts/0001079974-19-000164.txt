ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
We are a licensed and diversified, Colorado based real estate brokerage, property investor and landlord. We presently generate revenue from three sources:
 

1. | Rental revenue from our "Cannabis Zoned" warehouse property.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Commission revenue from the sale of third party owned real property.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Management revenue from real property managed for third party owners.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To activate our business we borrowed money from our President, Corey Wiegand, completed several private placements as well as a management led IPO. At December 31, 2018 our shares were quoted on the OTC Pinks Current under the symbol "HMTF."As of the date of this report our shares are quoted on OTC Pink Current and our trading symbol remains "HMTF."
 
Company History
 
We organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on July 28, 2008.
 
History of Operations.  In March of 2010, we began providing real estate agents with buyer leads and thereby obtaining referral commissions from subsequent sales. Colorado law provides that we must hold a real estate license to be paid such commissions. On February 13, 2012 the State of Colorado granted our founder, Corey Wiegand an "Employing Broker" license which satisfied regulatory requirements through April 21st, 2018 when as part of a settlement with Colorado DORA we hired Jennifer Berg to serve the Company as Employing Broker. As of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report, commission revenue from real estate transactions form a significant part of our total revenue.
 
During 2013 we expanded our real estate activities to include property management and as of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report, we manage 162 rental units and generate net revenue from monthly management fees.
 
On March 3, 2014 we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, HMTF Cannabis Holdings, Inc. The purpose of our subsidiary is to acquire and generate income from real property suited to the legal cultivation of marijuana.
 
On September 15, 2014 we closed the purchase of our first property zoned for legal cannabis cultivation.  Our Denver warehouse building is comprised of three units.  As of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report, revenue generated from this commercial property represents a significant portion of our total revenue.
 
We purchased our warehouse with a 1% down payment with the balance carried by the seller. On November 5 and December 1, 2014 we leased space within the building to several unrelated licensed growers. One grower completed construction work on his two units and subsequently we amended his lease to include the third unit which had been abandoned by the original lessee. The City of Denver has issued our tenant an occupancy permit providing for legal marijuana cultivation at all three units which comprise the entire building.  Our tenant paid for improvements to bring the building into compliance with Building Codes of the City of Denver and rules promulgated by Colorado State Marijuana Enforcement Division. Further information regarding our cannabis warehouse venture and related financial performance and projections may be found on pages 6 and 7 of this report and also in the MD&A section of this report.
 
As of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report, we are attempting to either sell our warehouse, refinance it with a conventional commercial lender, or raise money to pay off the owner carry note. We are also seeking to acquire additional capital to expand into other states.
 
We have recently entered discussions with potential underwriters to raise equity capital to expand operations. In connections with these discussions, we are exploring the sale of additional shares of our common stock, or, alternatively the sale of shares of presently authorized but undesignated shares of Preferred Stock. Underwriting proceeds, if generated, could be utilized to acquire other real estate companies and/or acquire income property believed suitable for generating new and significant cash flow, the major portion of which could be set aside to pay dividends.

Finally, we continue to generate commission revenue by listing and selling real property. We also generate commissions on sales of property where we serve as 'buyer agent." We continue to expand the list of properties from which we generate management revenue.

 Principal Services and their Markets
 
Home Treasure Finders, Inc. is a diversified, full service licensed real estate brokerage. We are client driven. We provide free investment seminars to the public and train our Licensed Real Estate Agents to assist their clients to understand and successfully compete in three areas:
 
1. Real Estate Sales. Our mission is to help clients buy and sell properties under favorable terms. We train our Licensed Real Estate Agents to obtain listings which we market aggressively. We assist home buyers to locate and close the purchase of their "dream home". Our Licensed Real Estate Agents also advise clients seeking high returns from real estate investment. We locate and help our clients acquire suitable income property. We generate a commission on completed transactions.
 
2. Property Management. We collect rents online each month from tenants living in the properties we manage.  Our monthly management fees are deducted from rent. We pay the resulting net rent to property owners each month. We inspect each property monthly. We help owners arrange for routine maintenance and repairs as needed.
 
3. Commercial Real Estate for Cannabis.  After completing due diligence to verify the legality of numerous activities in which we might participate, we elected to acquire a cannabis zoned industrial warehouse in Denver.
 
We have actively and aggressively invested our own funds to enter Colorado's unique and fast growing cannabis cultivation industry. We presently own one cannabis cultivation warehouse in Denver Colorado and lease space within that project to aid licensed cannabis grower. To date, this project has been successful in generating net revenue for our own account.
 
For additional information see page 6 and the Management's Discussion and Analysis starting on page 22.
 
We may own properties for our own investment account and as such are solely at financial risk in connection with our investments. We may invest our funds or alternately arrange to have tenants, at their expense improve and/or remodel properties to suit their needs.  In the event we utilize funds loaned to us by third party groups, they may in some circumstances share certain risks.
 
We do not grow, distribute or sell cannabis  We have no present plan to engage in such activities or obtain a license to do so, now, or in the future. However, we are presently the landlord to a licensed tenant who may directly engage in the cultivation, distribution and sale of cannabis. Accordingly, we exercise appropriate and reasonable care to screen our tenants and insist that our tenants maintain proper licenses and operate in compliance with the state and local rules.
 
We are uniquely positioned and experienced to assist clients and investor groups seeking opportunity in Colorado's rapidly evolving cannabis industry. We may expand operations into other states.
 
Marketing of our Services
 
Each of our three divisions has a unique marketing plan developed by our founder and CEO, Corey Wiegand.
 
1.   Real Estate Sales. We conduct free monthly seminars for existing and prospective clients. Our seminars include intensive training in property buying, selling and rental. We offer a choice of seminars as our clients include both first time purchasers as well as seasoned real estate investors.

Further, as an aid to listing and selling properties our Licensed Real Estate Agents may elect to attend 12 two hour training seminars, weekly sales meetings, and participate in on the job mentoring as personally taught by Corey Wiegand. We train our agents to prospect for listings, obtain listing contracts, and convert the CALL AND TEXT CAPTURE ("integrated voice response") phone leads into "buy-side" contracts. The CALL AND TEXT CAPTURE leads are generated by our signs placed in front of listed properties. Our CALL AND TEXT CAPTURE system is fully functional.  It incorporates call capture technology through which we provide our Licensed Real Estate Agents with real time access to leads.


Our sign riders are attached to normal real estate "for sale" signs located in front of a listed and selected managed properties. Our rider displays a local cell number and promises to provide listing specific information. When a caller calls or texts the number, the caller's phone number is captured by a Home Treasure Finders owned and operated cell phone. This is then forwarded to a Home Treasure Finders buyer agent. Our business plan provides that our buyer agents will endeavor to immediately call back the potential buyer and begin a dialog designed to convert the "cold lead" to a signed offer to purchase a property.
 
When our buyer agent closes the related sale, Home Treasure Finders may be paid a portion of the total commission. This occurs on any sale involving the potential buyer who was introduced to the buyer agent by Home Treasure Finders and closing within one year of the original lead date. This feature of our business plan enables us to generate revenue even if the buyer eventually decides to purchase a property other than the one displaying our CALL AND TEXT CAPTUREsign
 
2.  Property Management.  The Denver Metro population has continued to accelerate.  As a result there is a shortage of affordable low cost residential rentals.  As of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report, all 107 of the residential units in Colorado and 55 units in Kansas City, Kansas we manage are fully occupied.  We arrange showings seven days per week.  We tailor our management services to meet the unique needs of each of our clients.
 
3.  Commercial Real Estate for Cannabis. We are an active participant in Colorado's fast growing cannabis industry. We have successfully acquired a vacant warehouse zoned for cannabis cultivation for our own account with a $10,000 down payment. Subsequently we leased the warehouse to licensed growers and we enjoy a positive cash flow from tenant rents.
 
Our warehouse lease now in place amounts to a 12.0% capitalization rate.  This assumes the property's estimated value of One million dollars. This figure is based on the offering price of comparable like properties that are being sold in Denver as of the date of this audit. As of the date of this report we have not obtained an appraisal to confirm this estimate. As of the date of this report, the annual net operating income from the property of $60,943 represents 2,550% cash on cash return on our initial investment of $21,000.  The average annualized rate of return on this initial investment is approximately 168%.


We specialize in analysis of property cash flow. We prepare projections using our knowledge of comparable properties and various other techniques. We encourage clients to focus on acquiring prime properties under terms that make investment success most likely.
 
Competition
 
There are many real estate companies; however, management is aware of none that maintain operations to service all three of the diverse market segments which we specialize.
 
Each of our divisions face significant competition. We are active in front range Colorado markets including Greeley, the Denver Metro area and Colorado Springs. We are also active in Kansas City, Kansas.

1.  Real Estate Sales.  The Denver Area Real Estate market has experienced remarkable appreciation.  We distinguish ourselves by providing a high level of training and services to our brokers, such as CALL AND TEXT CAPTURE property signs plus aerial fly by video marketing and virtual tours, rather than still photos. Our strategic partnership with Visionary Aircraft Corporation allows our agents to receive a discounted rate for all listing video footage. Our training program outlines a proven system for agents to succeed in establishing themselves as area specialists by prospecting door-to-door for new listings. We believe our competition does not provide effective training to convert leads to sales. In response to competition from discount brokers we allow experienced agents to park their license at our office for a small monthly desk fee. Thereafter, we generally collect an additional transaction fee for each sale they close.
 
2.  Property Management.  The Denver Metro population has continued to accelerate.  As a result there is a shortage of affordable low cost residential rentals.  As of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report, all 107 of the residential units in Colorado and 55 units in Kansas City, Kansas we manage are fully occupied.  We arrange showings seven days per week.  We tailor our management services to meet the unique needs of each of our clients.


3.  Commercial Real Estate for Cannabis. We are an active participant in Colorado's fast growing cannabis industry. We have successfully acquired a vacant warehouse zoned for cannabis cultivation for our own account with a $10,000 down payment. Subsequently we leased the warehouse to licensed growers and we enjoy a positive cash flow from tenant rents.
 
Our warehouse lease now in place amounts to a 12.0% capitalization rate.  This assumes the property's estimated value of One million dollars. This figure is based on the offering price of comparable like properties that are being sold in Denver as of the date of this audit. As of the date of this report we have not obtained an appraisal to confirm this estimate. As of the date of this report, the annual net operating income from the property of $43,000 represents 840% cash on cash return on our initial investment of $27,000.  The average annualized rate of return on this initial investment is approximately 168%.
 
Further, as licensed commercial Licensed Real Estate Agents we enjoy strong operational advantages and honed skills to rapidly locate favorable cannabis zoning, find vacant property and help clients negotiate favorable financing  or leasing arrangements at target properties.
 
We market primarily by word of mouth because much of the prime real estate that is usable for cannabis cultivation under state and local rulemaking is within a short drive from our office.  We have few true competitors who bring our diverse skill, experience, work ethic and enthusiasm to the bargaining table.
 
Home Treasure Finders now provides both leads and specialized training at no cost to buyer agents. Our Licensed Real Estate Agents are requested to sign our agreement to split gross commissions or agree to pay a monthly desk fee and transaction fee.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The sales training material developed by Corey Wiegand are considered "trade secrets," and are believed eligible for copyright protection.  As of the date of this report no copyright has been filed.
 
As part of Colorado's fastest growing industry, cannabis, we have developed a data base of cannabis regulation issues for our internal use. Where feasible we employ that data to assist our clients, potential tenants and investors.  Our data base includes zoning and Cannabis use rules we believe to be currently in effect.  It is updated by interviews with state, county and municipal officials on an as needed basis.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
During November of 2000 Colorado voters approved Amendment 20 to amend the State Constitution to provide for legalized use and possession of medical marijuana.

During October, 2009, the Obama Administration ended aggressive law enforcement against medical marijuana growers, patients and dispensaries by drafting a memo later called the Cole memo.  In 2018, Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General under the current administration, rescinded this memo however, we do not know of any judicial actions with respect to federal enforcement of Marijuana laws at the state level.
 
During November 2012 Colorado voters approved Amendment 64 to the State Constitution to legalize the use, possession and sale of retail marijuana. Amendment 64 also provides for the Colorado General Assembly to enact an excise tax on wholesale marijuana sales, adopt further rules to govern cultivation, processing, retail sale and finally to give cities and counties the ability to locally opt out of retail marijuana.
 
On March 30, 2017, legislation was filed in the US House and Senate to end marijuana prohibition at the federal level and replace it with a system in which marijuana is regulated and taxed similar to alcohol. The proposed legislation would:
 

1. | Remove marijuana from the Controlled Substance Act
---+---------------------------------------------------


2. | Create a federal regulatory process for states that choose to regulate the cultivation and sale of marijuana for adult use
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Eliminate many of the collateral consequences of the federal tax code so that state legal marijuana businesses can take standard deductions on business expense.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
After 2018’s midterm elections, 33 states have legalized medical marijuana and 10 states have legalized recreational marijuana.
 
While we believe strong public support exists for adoption of these or similar measures, there is no assurance that federal laws will be changed accordingly.  Recently, the Trump Administration and US Department of Justice have indicated that they are reversing course and may elect to activate more restrictive measures. Thereafter, governors of numerous states, including Colorado, where liberalized marijuana laws exist, have responded that they support a continuation of their respective liberalization policies and will oppose any inappropriate federal enforcement efforts that may be forthcoming. We remain unclear as to how this conflict may resolve and what effect it may have on company real estate holdings and related revenue.

Maintaining all licenses deemed necessary by governmental jurisdictions is expensive and time consuming. and could delay operations.  An unfavorable outcome in connection with future government regulations, licensing and other risks is possible.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning the environment. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our planned revenue or competitive position.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
 
Our services expose the Company to liability claims by real estate owners, potential buyers and others. The company maintains legally required liability insurance. Any claim not covered by our policy could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
OUR FACILITIES
 
We conduct general administration, real estate sales and property management from our leased office location in Denver Colorado.

Our office is located at 4045 Pecos Street, Suite 110, Denver CO 80211. This is a preferred storefront shopping location in the up and coming Sunnyside Neighborhood. We enjoy good visibility and walk-by exposure.
 
Our warehouse is located at 4430 Garfield Street, Denver, Colorado 80216 in an industrial neighborhood zoned for cannabis cultivation. The properties located in Zip Code 80216 have recently had the highest appreciation rate in Denver. Numerous warehouses utilized for cannabis cultivation are located in this industrial district of Denver.
 
SEASONALITY
 
Our business is materially affected by seasonal factors, including but not limited to:
 

1. | Changes in residential real estate inventory 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Changes in buyer demand caused by the economy, holidays, Fall "back to school" or other special events 
3. | Unusual or severe weather 
4. | The seasonal nature of major construction projects in Colorado 

EMPLOYEES
 
As of the date of this report we have two employees, Corey Wiegand, our founder and CEO and Jennifer Berg, Employing Broker. We also utilize additional contract labor.
RISK FACTORS
 
This investment has a high degree of risk.  Before you invest you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed and the value of our stock could go down. This means you could lose all or a part of your investment.
 
Our Auditor's report states that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.
 
We have had substantial losses since inception and as of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report we have minimal cash reserves. While we are beginning to generate increasing revenue and a positive cash flow, our ability to build significant cash reserves and continue as a going concern over the long term remains unproven.  In the event that we are forced to reduce operations or seriously curtail our business, an investor will lose all money invested.

The business of our Cannabis Holdings Subsidiary is dependent on laws pertaining to the marijuana industry.
 
Continued development of the cannabis industry and a successful role in that industry for our Subsidiary, HMTF Cannabis Holdings, Inc. is dependent upon continued legislative authorization at the state level. While there may be ample public support for legislative action that favors our industry, numerous factors impact the legislative process.
 
As of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report, 33 states have legalized medical marijuana and 10 states have legalized recreational marijuana. The states that have legalized recreational marijuana are; Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Nevada, California, Michigan, Vermont, Maine and Maryland.


During November of 2000 Colorado voters approved Amendment 20 to amend the State Constitution to provide for legalized use, possession and sale of medical marijuana.
 
During November 2012 Colorado voters approved Amendment 64 to the State Constitution to legalize the use, possession and sale of retail marijuana. Amendment 64 also provides for the Colorado General Assembly to enact an excise tax on wholesale marijuana sales, adopt further rules to govern cultivation, processing  retail sale and finally to give cities and counties the ability to locally opt out of retail marijuana.
 
These state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana  use and possession illegal on a national level.
 
The following links may be of use to understand the details of Colorado Laws.
 
http://new.livestream.com/accounts/4105485/CAR031314
 http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/Rev-MMJ/CBON/1251581331216
 
During October, 2009 the Obama Administration ended aggressive law enforcement against medical marijuana patients and dispensaries. The Obama administration had effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state designed laws allowing the use and distribution of marijuana.


However, there is no guarantee the Trump administration will not change this stated policy regarding low-priority enforcement of laws and the new administration may change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws. Any significant tightening in the federal government's enforcement policies could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.
 
Further, while we do not grow, harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, by leasing facilities to growers of cannabis, we could be deemed to be participating in marijuana cultivation, which remains illegal under federal law, and expose us to potential criminal liability, with additional risk that our properties could be subject to civil forfeiture proceedings.
 
Marijuana remains illegal under Federal Law
 
Marijuana is a schedule-1 controlled substance and is illegal under Federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our inability to proceed with the cannabis properties portion of our business plan.
 
A revision or reversal of the Federal policies which presently allow Colorado and various other states to pursue legalized marijuana would likely cause widespread financial difficulties to the cannabis business nationally.
 
The 2016 National elections installed a presidential administration having an intolerant policy toward Marijuana Legalization. However, since receiving the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, we believe Colorado's Cannabis Industry is now at decreased risk of vigorous enforcement of Federal Laws which prohibit Cannabis cultivation, sale and consumption. Session’s replacement, Matthew Whittaker is seen by many in congress as a new guiding light in the age of cannabis reform.

---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Create a federal regulatory process for states that choose to regulate the cultivation and sale of marijuana for adult use 
3. | Eliminate many of the collateral consequences of the federal tax code so that state legal marijuana businesses can take standard deductions on business expense. 

 
While we believe strong public support exists for adoption of these or similar measures, there is no assurance that federal laws will be changed accordingly.

The Marijuana Industry faces strong opposition.
 
It is believed by many that large well-funded businesses may have a strong economic opposition to the cannabis industry.  We believe that the pharmaceutical industry clearly does not want to cede control of any product that could generate significant revenue. For example, we believe medical marijuana likely has adversely impacted the consumer market for the proposed "marijuana pill" which may sold by the mainstream pharmaceutical industry.  Legalization of marijuana could displace other drugs or encroach upon the pharmaceutical industry's products. The pharmaceutical industry is well funded with a strong and experienced lobby that eclipses the funding of the medical marijuana movement.   Inroads, if any, that the pharmaceutical industry makes toward halting the cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on our proposed business.
 
Tenants of our Company owned Denver warehouse facility, and of any additional facilities of a similar nature which we may acquire in the future, may have difficulty accessing the services of banks which may make it difficult for them to operate.
 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under Federal law, a compelling argument has been made in the past that banks cannot accept deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. We believe that this argument may someday be abandoned, but there is no assurance of this. Recently the State of Colorado has made efforts to organize Fourth Corner Credit Union which is intended to serve the banking needs of the Cannabis Industry in Colorado.  On February 2, 2018 the Federal Reserve granted Colorado a conditional approval However, as of the date of this report this facility has not opened for business and given the attitudes of the new administration, may never open. There is no assurance that the environment for banking relationships will progress favorably. In any case, inability to open conventional bank accounts may continue make it difficult for marijuana connected businesses to operate.
 
Discount Brokers are gaining a larger share of the revenues generated by real estate transactions.  Competitors can duplicate the business model of our Subsidiary, HMTF Cannabis Holdings. Inc.
 
While our subsidiary has acquired, improved and leased properties suitable to legal cultivation of cannabis, there is no aspect of our business model which is protected by patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade names. As a result, potential competitors will likely duplicate our business model.
 
A significant portion of our monthly cash flow derives from rental revenue derived from our warehouse, which may prove uncollectable.
 
We carefully vet prospective tenants, and we obtain their personal guarantees as to payment and performance under the lease terms.
 
In the event the cultivation business of one or more grower tenants fails, or for any reason our tenant fails to pay rent in a timely fashion and we do not receive the rent payments as such payments become due under lease terms, thereafter, if satisfactory payment arrangements as acceptable to us are not made, we may be forced to evict.
 


10
--



Under terms of the leases now in effect, if we do not receive rent payments as such payments become due and payable under lease terms, we may first utilize the sums we hold as tenant security deposits to collect the late rent payments with penalty. Under the terms of the leases in place, tenants then are required, within five days, to replace such security deposit sums such that the full tenant security deposit is restored. There is no assurance that such replacements of deposit sums will actually occur.
 
In any event, if tenants do not comply with lease terms, and no workable arrangement can be achieved, we may be forced to evict one or more tenants. This has occurred in the past and could occur again. Unfavorable developments of this nature could contribute to or cause us to fall behind on our obligations to make monthly mortgage payments as such payments become due.
 
During the past we have experienced disagreements with our warehouse tenants.  One tenant abandoned his unit and was evicted. The other tenant ultimately amended his lease to include the abandoned space but only after considerable argument over various lease terms had been settled.  As of the date of this report, a single tenant is leasing our entire Garfield Street warehouse and that tenant has generally remained current on lease payments.  As of December 31, 2018, our tenant has signed a new lease with triple net terms believed favorable to our refinance efforts. As of the date of this report, we are aware of no unresolved tenant issues.


If we pursue an action for eviction, one or more tenants might cause physical damage to our real estate and/or fight an action for eviction, and/or refuse to vacate or otherwise undertake to block and/or slow our efforts to regain proper possession of our warehouse or to locate a suitable alternative tenant to re-lease our warehouse.
 
We believe that we have acted legally and in good faith with respect to our warehouse tenant. We further believe that our real estate is adequately insured. We plan to defend our property and related contractual rights to the fullest extent of the law.  In the past we were assisted by counsel to negotiate a suitable remedy to various disputes.  There is no present way to predict the final outcome of any new issues that may arise.
 
A tenant, present or former, may claim to have suffered damages and in connection with that belief, may elect to initiate and thereafter pursue one or more regulatory complaints or lawsuits against the Company, its management and subsidiaries.
 
We believe we have acted properly in all of our dealings with tenants at our warehouse and properties we manage for third parties and otherwise. We have requested counsel to confirm the legality of our past and present agreements and actions and to advise us accordingly. In any case, we have prevailed in various prior matters of this nature and we plan to vigorously defend any suit or regulatory complaint brought against the Company, its employees or agents.
 
We have a limited operating history and operate under a professional license held by management
 
Our ability to achieve consistent cash flow and profitability depends upon the continued service of Corey Wiegand. Mr. Wiegand is our primary source of commission revenue, our CEO and our only management level executive. Mr. Wiegand holds a Broker Associate’s license, and Jennifer Berg holds an Employing Broker license, both issued by the State of Colorado. All of our Colorado based real estate brokerage and management revenue depend upon the present licenses held by Mr. Wiegand and Ms. Berg. In the event that the license held by Mr. Wiegand and/or Ms. Berg is censured or otherwise downgraded by an action of regulatory process, our business could be damaged. We believe that Mr. Wiegand and Ms. Berg have complied with all licensing requirements.


Our business plan provides that we will grow rapidly and ultimately deliver professional services to would be buyers through licensed Real Estate Agents acting as listing agents and buyer agents rather than primarily through commissions earned by our founder.

--




To actualize this goal, we plan to market our advanced sales techniques to established realtors that wish to earn more commissions from buyer transactions. We are working to recruit buyer agents to sign our master referral agreements, graduate from our workshops and respond to our CALL AND TEXT CAPTURE leads.  As of the date of this report, we are training additional buyer agents.
 
Our real estate sales business plan provides that we will grow rapidly and ultimately deliver professional services to would be buyers through "buyer agents" rather than primarily through our founder. To actualize this goal, we plan to market our advanced sales techniques to established realtors that wish to earn more commissions from buyer transactions. We plan to aggressively expand our professional staff.
 
We have activated our plan to recruit buyer agents to sign our master referral agreements, graduate from our workshops and respond to our CALL AND TEXT CAPTURE leads.  As of the date of this report, in addition to Mr. Wiegand, we have additional active licensed Real Estate Agents and we are endeavoring to recruit and train more agents. All of our trainees are either presently licensed or enrolled in courses operated by third party realtor schools. All of our trainees pay their own expenses for the classes. We may elect to offer newly hired Licensed Real Estate Agents a bonus plan which awards shares of our common stock which vest over a one year period assuming productivity goals are achieved. Further detail is outlined in the Broker Relationship Agreement signed by each new hire.
 
We may not be able to generate predictable and continuous revenue in the future. Further, there is no assurance that we will ever grow operations outside the Denver Metro area.  While we own a cannabis qualified warehouse and lease it to licensed growers who are presently current on rent payments, the cash flow generated is from a new untested industry which is unique to Colorado and just a few other states and subject to rapid change.  In the event that the present tenant is in default of lease terms and is evicted from the property, we will have to replace that tenant. 
 
We may incur significant operating losses in the future, due to the expansion of our operations or other factors. There is no assurance that we can expand under terms that permit profitable operations over the long term. Failure to generate sufficient revenue to pay expenses as they come due may make us unable to continue as a going concern and result in the failure of our company and the complete loss of any money invested to purchase our shares.
 
We may be unable to manage our growth or implement our expansion strategy.
 
Several years ago, Mr. Wiegand contributed his property management entity known as CW Properties and we have taken over operations.  We currently manage 162 rental units and as of December 31, 2018 and the date of this report our management activities continue to generate net revenue from management fees.  In the future we may undertake additional activities in property management as well as those in connection with our ongoing business plan or, alternatively we may elect to sell our property management business.
 
As a public company, our expenses include, but are not limited to, annual audits, legal costs, SEC reporting costs, costs of a transfer agent and the costs associated with fees and compliance. Further, our management will need to invest significant time and energy to stay current with the public company responsibilities of our business and will therefore have diminished time available to apply to other tasks necessary to our survival and growth.
 
It is therefore possible that the financial and time burdens of operating as a public company will cause us to fail to achieve profitability.  If we exhaust our funds, our business will fail and our investors will lose all money invested in our stock.
 
If we fail to pay public company costs, as such costs are incurred; we could become delinquent in our reporting obligations and face the delisting of our shares.
 
It is essential that we grow our business, achieve significant profits and maintain adequate cash flow in order to pay the cost of remaining public which includes but is not limited the costs of remaining current with SEC reporting obligations.

We have recently expanded brokerage and property management. In Colorado we now operate in Colorado Springs and Greeley. In Kansas we operate in Kansas City.
 
The issuance of additional shares of our common stock may be necessary for the implementation of our growth strategy.
 
A limited private placement of restricted shares of our common stock was completed several years ago. Cash generated was used to acquire cannabis zoned real property, finance our office space and provide working capital.  Issuance of any additional securities pursuant to future fundraising activities undertaken may significantly dilute the ownership of existing shareholders and may reduce the price of our common stock.


Our subsidiary, HMTF Cannabis Holdings has acquired, improved and leased a Denver warehouse to a licensed third party grower, rent is current and the warehouse is showing positive cash flow.
 
However, activation of our warehouse project was accomplished primarily through an owner-carry purchase arrangement and funds invested by the tenant to improve the property. To acquire additional properties suitable to the cultivations of cannabis may require sale of additional restricted shares in a private placement. Alternately, a debt financing could be utilized; however any debt financing will require payment of interest and may involve offering security interests in our planned properties and possibly issuing warrants to purchase our common stock. Future financings, if undertaken, could impose limitations on our operating flexibility and may involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or warrants to purchase shares of common stock and may be dilutive to our existing shareholders.
 
While we have been able to acquire a warehouse in Denver Colorado with 99% owner finance, future acquisitions may require financial resources well in excess of our present balance sheet. Failure to successfully obtain additional funding would likely jeopardize our ability to expand our cannabis business and related operations. 
 
Further, we need to raise money for working capital and to finance new opportunities presented by legalization of on-site consumption. To these ends, we may file a Memorandum with the Colorado Division of Securities to pursue an Intra-State Offering of additional shares of our common stock over the internet. There is no assurance that the Colorado Division of Securities will approve our offering or that any shares will be sold under the terms of our proposed offering.
 
As a full reporting public company, we have no access to Reg A Plus or Reg CF as a means to generate cash from the sale of our shares. Further, as a public company we have no access to internet based “crowd funding.”
 
Risk of insolvency from possible of loss of an important property management client and related revenues.
 
Our largest property management client, accounting for a significant portion of our property management revenue, has informed us that rental properties which we presently manage for their family business may need to be sold in the near term. While we believe we would act as selling broker to represent the family if such sale becomes necessary, there is no assurance that we will earn commissions in connection with the contemplated liquidation or continue a business relationship thereafter. We have further been informed that proceeds of the contemplated liquidation will likely be distributed to individual family members. In the likely event that third parties who purchase properties we presently manage do not contract with us to continue as property manager, a significant portion of our revenue may abruptly cease. In any case, we presently view these developments as negative from our perspective, and we will endeavor to assist our client and find means to replace lost revenue.


The loss of our current executive officer or key management personnel or inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations
 
Our success is heavily dependent on the continued active participation of our current executive officer and sole director listed under "Management." Loss of the services of Corey Wiegand, or any significant negative development in connection with any professional license held by Mr. Wiegand would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, our success and achievement of our growth plans depend on our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical, professional, clerical, administrative and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified buyer agents among companies in the real estate industry is intense, and the loss of any of such persons, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate any additional highly skilled realtors required for the expansion or maintenance of our activities, could have a materially adverse effect on our future financial performance.  Inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel, consultants and advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  


We are controlled by our current officer and director.
 
Corey Wiegand, our sole director, who is our sole executive officer, who, as of December 31, 2018, beneficially owns approximately 50.7% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. Mr. Wiegand consequently controls the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of issues submitted to our stockholders.

Since we have only one director who serves as our president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer and secretary, decisions which affect the company will be made by only one individual.  It is likely that conflicts of interest will arise in the day-to- day operations of our business.  Such conflicts, if not properly resolved, could have a material negative impact on our business. 
 
In the past, the Company has issued shares for cash and services at prices which were solely determined by Corey Wiegand. At that time, Mr. Wiegand made a determination of both the value of services exchanged for our shares, and, as well, the price per share used as compensation.   Transactions of this nature were not made at arm's length and were made without input from a knowledgeable and non-interested third party.  Future transactions of a like nature could dilute the percentage ownership of the company owned by a given investor. While the company believes its past transactions were appropriate, and plans to act in good faith in the future, an investor in our shares will have no ability to alter such transactions as they may occur in the future and, further, will not be consulted by the company in advance of any such transactions. An investor who is unwilling to endure such potential dilution should not purchase our shares.
 
We have limited financial resources to take advantage of advertising opportunities as they may arise.

The inability to pay for press releases, investor road shows or other media events intended to expose our shares to institutional investors, could adversely affect our ability to generate investor support for our common shares.
 
Our operating results will be subject to fluctuations and our stock price may decline significantly.
 
Our quarterly revenue and operating results from commissions, management fees and lease revenues, if any, will be difficult to predict from quarter to quarter. We derive relatively stable revenue from our property management operations. Nonetheless, it is possible that our net operating results in some quarters will fall below our expectations. Our quarterly operating results will be affected by a number of factors, including: 
 

• | trends in the median home values in Colorado; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the availability, pricing and timeliness of web advertising campaigns; 
• | the impact of seasonal variations in demand and/or revenue recognition linked to construction cycles and weather conditions and the retail price of signs, sign riders, telephone services, and Sales Workshops;
• | timing, availability and changes in government incentive programs; 
• | unplanned additional expenses and/or shortfalls in anticipated rental income at our warehouse property; 
• | logistical costs; 
• | unpredictable volume and timing of buyer's agent sales; 
• | our ability to establish and expand listing agent relationships; 
• | the number of buyer agents that we are able to recruit; 
• | the timing of new technology announcements or introductions by our competitors and other developments in the competitive environment; 
• | increases or decreases in real estate appreciation rates due to changes in economic growth; 
• | travel costs and other factors causing the mentor training business to become more difficult; and 
• | changes in lending, inspection, appraisal and other factors that result in closing delays or cancellations. 

 
If revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect, we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter, which would harm our operating results for that quarter. If we fail to meet investor expectations or our own future guidance, even by a small amount, our stock price could decline, perhaps substantially.

Existing real estate laws, regulations, land use codes and policies, the rules promulgated by the Department of Regulatory Agencies or the State of Colorado's Marijuana Enforcement authorities and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to our real estate operations, potential buyers and to our tenants at the Company's Garfield Street warehouse or elsewhere.
 
The market for homes and other real estate is influenced by U.S. federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the real estate industry, as well as policies promulgated by local real estate boards. These regulations and policies often relate to realtor compensation, and pricing. In the U.S. and in a number of other countries, these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified. Investment in the real estate could be deterred by these regulations and policies, which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for various types of real property and  for our services. For example, loss of favorable tax treatment, certain government buyer incentive programs, and or government subsidized or backed loan programs may result in loss of sales which would likely harm our financial performance.  
 
The reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could cause our revenue to decline.

Today, we believe consumer confidence is high and trending upwards. However buyers are finding it very difficult to locate affordable properties and qualify for loans. Interest on mortgages is rising.   In the past federal, state and local government bodies in many states have provided incentives in the form of rebates, tax credits and other incentives to buyers that are willing to purchase real estate. For example, an eight thousand dollar first time home buyer tax credit was offered and thereafter the credit offering expired.  Future government economic incentives, if any, could be reduced or eliminated altogether. Such home buyer incentives expire, decline over time, are limited in total funding or require renewal of authority. Reductions in, or eliminations or expirations of governmental incentives could result in decreased demand for our services.
 
Changes in tax laws or fiscal policies may decrease the return on investment for customers of our business which could decrease demand for our services and harm our business.
 
We anticipate that a portion of our future revenues will be derived from commissions in connection with the sale of single family residences to individual homebuyers. In deciding whether to purchase or to rent, prospective customers may evaluate their projected return on investment. Such projections are based on current and proposed federal, state and local laws, particularly tax legislation. Changes to these laws, including amendments to existing tax laws or the introduction of new tax laws, tax court rulings as well as changes in administrative guidelines, ordinances and similar rules and regulations could result in different tax assessments and may adversely affect a homeowner's projected return on investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Problems with service quality or agent performance may include agent error, agent negligence or problems within the mentoring services we plan to provide. The result would likely be fewer customers, reduced revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share.
 
We are significantly reliant on the abilities and skills of Corey Wiegand, Jennifer Berg, Employing Broker and other agents and assistants that act on our behalf.  In the past, various clients who received services from our company or who lease our Garfield Street warehouse or leased the residential property we manage have filed complaints that allege poor performance, fraud or in some way challenge our performance.  While we believe that these allegations are without merit and we vigorously defend the legality and appropriateness of our past actions, we may fall victim to regulatory actions or court rulings in connection with alleged agent errors, omissions or other issues.  
 
The Realtors we plan to recruit may not deliver consistent and professional mentor and "buyer agent" services and thus our business plan may not gain market acceptance, which would prevent us from achieving sales and market share
 
The development of a successful market for our mentor services and lead generation techniques may be adversely affected by a number of factors: 
 

● | failure to compete favorably against other services and techniques on the basis of cost, quality and performance; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | failure to compete favorably against conventional sales agents and realtors and alternative lead-generation technologies, such as text and e-mail spamming on the basis of cost, quality and performance.

If the services and techniques we offer fail to gain market acceptance, we will be unable to achieve significant sales and market share.
 
The real estate industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. A variety of competing lead generation technologies are in use or under development now that could result in lower buyer agent costs or higher conversion rates than those lead generation technologies selected by us. These development efforts may render obsolete the lead generation services we have to offer. 
 
Existing telephone and web advertising regulations and changes to such regulations may present regulatory and economic barriers to our real estate lead generation activities.
 
Lead generation activity is heavily influenced by federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the tech based marketing industry, as well as internal policies and regulations promulgated by "national do not call lists." These regulations and policies often relate to public privacy. In the United States these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified. We anticipate that our lead generation channels and activity will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to privacy protection, and related matters.  Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our lead generation services may result in significant additional expenses to us and as a result, could cause a significant reduction in sales referrals and related commission revenue. 
 
If our services are not suitable for widespread adoption, or a sufficient demand for trained buyer agents or leads does not develop, or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, we would be unable to achieve sufficient revenue growth.
 
The market for residential real estate is rapidly evolving and its future is uncertain. We have begun offering free seminars on real estate investing. These are proving useful to finding new clients; however, if real estate proves unsuitable for widespread ownership or if demand for our seminars and related services fails to develop sufficiently, we would be unable to achieve sales and market share. Many factors will influence our revenues: 
 

• | success of alternative lead generation technologies such as web-casts, text messaging, email spamming; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | fluctuations in economic and market conditions, such as decreases in available inventory, that impact the viability of real estate purchases; 
• | increases or decreases in the costs associated with obtaining a residential home loan; 
• | capital expenditures by customers, which tend to decrease when the domestic or foreign economies slow; 
• | continued regulation of the real estate and lending industries; and 
• | availability and effectiveness of government subsidies and incentives. 

 
The reduction in home loan availability could prevent us from achieving sales and market share.
 
The reduction or elimination of government lending incentives may adversely affect the growth of this market or result in increased price competition, which could prevent us from achieving sales and market share. 
 
Today, over 70% of home loans are insured by the federal housing administration (FHA loans). These loans are popular because they have lower down payment requirements and lower credit score requirements.  Should FHA raise their down payment or credit requirements the result could be reduced home purchases which would significantly harm our business.

We face intense competition from other real estate brokerages and other discount real estate companies. If we fail to compete effectively, we may be unable to increase our market share and sales.
 
Most of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. We compete with a growing number of discount brokers. Our competitors' greater size in some cases provides them with competitive advantages with respect to marketing costs due to their ability to allocate fixed costs across a greater volume of marketing channels and purchase signs and services at lower prices. They also have far greater name recognition, an established network of past customers. In addition, many of our competitors have well-established relationships with current and potential home sellers. As a result, our competitors will be able to devote greater resources to prospecting, relationship development, and promotion and may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements than we can. 
 
A substantial number of our issued shares are, or are being made available for sale on the open market. The resale of these securities might adversely affect our stock price.
 
The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the market's anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise obtain.
 
Availability of these shares for sale in the public market could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities.
 
There is presently a limited trading market for our shares.  An investment in our shares may be or become totally illiquid and any investor purchasing our shares may be unable to resell their shares.  There can be no assurance that market interest in our shares will develop or continue.  Therefore, investors who purchase our shares could lose their entire investment.


Even if significant trading activity involving our shares continues, the volume of trading may be small and on some days the volume may be zero. Our share price will likely be volatile and will likely fall rapidly should an investor attempt to liquidate a significant number of shares.  These conditions are likely to persist and could prevent resale of our shares on desirable terms.  
 
We are subject to corporate governance and internal control reporting requirements, and our costs related to compliance with, or our failure to comply with existing and future requirements, could adversely affect our business.
 
We face corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules and regulations subsequently adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future. In particular, under new SEC rules we will be required to include management's report on internal controls as part of our annual report pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Furthermore, under the proposed rules, an attestation report on our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm will be required as part of our annual report. We are in the process of evaluating our control structure to help ensure that we will be able to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The financial cost of compliance with these laws, rules and regulations is expected to be substantial. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these laws, rules and regulations that address corporate governance, internal control reporting and similar matters. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and the value of our securities.

We are affected by general economic conditions.
 
While the Denver area economy is diversified and has recently experienced rapid growth as a result of the Legalization of Cannabis and other factors, growth at the same level is likely unsustainable. As of the date of this report, the Denver housing market has shown signs of slowing down and it is uncertain as to how long the widespread high appreciation rates and rent raises will continue. In particular, terrorist acts and similar events, continued turmoil in the Middle East or war in general could contribute to a slowdown of the market demand for real estate investments that require significant initial capital expenditures, including demand for fix and flips, rental properties, and new residential and commercial buildings. In addition, increases in interest rates may increase financing costs to customers, which in turn may decrease demand for real estate investment. If the economic recovery slows as a result of the recent economic, political and social turmoil, or if there are further terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere, we may experience decreases in the demand for our mentoring services.


Compliance with real estate law and local regulations can be expensive, and any alleged  non-compliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity, license censure and potentially significant monetary damages and fines 
 
The Company as well as its tenants must comply with all foreign, U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding licensing and insurance requirements. In addition, under some statutes and regulations, a government agency, or other parties, may seek recovery and response costs from an agent where warrantees have been made, even if the agent was not responsible for such a warrantee or is otherwise at fault. In the course of future business we may inadvertently refer business to an agent who does not comply with local laws and regulations.  Any failure by us to shift responsibility onto that agent, and thus restrict our liability in connection with the incident, could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions in our business operations. In addition, if more stringent laws and regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations could be substantial. Additionally, we have begun managing real estate located in Kansas City, Kansas. Expansion of operations outside of Colorado requires that we obtain and pay for additional licenses.
 
We have recently revised elements of our advertising and internal bookkeeping to comply with DORA regulations.
 
Recently we have spent significant time responding to consumer issues brought to our attention by DORA (Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies). A total of three regulatory contacts have occurred during the past ten years from disgruntled tenants or buyers in connections with our brokerage and management services.  The first two disputes in 2015 and 2016 created only annoyance due to  lost time, changes to bookkeeping methods, or the need to pay a nominal fine to the State. A third complaint was filed in 2017 and in connection with the DORA settlement we hired Jennifer Berg to serve as Employing Broker. Regardless of the merit of such past or future complaints, going forward, if we fail to prove to the satisfaction of DORA that we have complied with real estate laws and regulations, we may be required to pay substantial fines and/or face license discipline. In the event we receive but cannot accept an unfavorable ruling by DORA, we have the option to appeal the decision to the Colorado Attorney General. There is no assurance of success in undertaking such an appeal. We do not expect future disputes, however in the event such problems arise we could be forced to alter, suspend, or cease certain real estate operations.
 
There are restrictions on the transferability of the securities.
 
Until registered for resale, investors must bear the economic risk of an investment in the Shares for an indefinite period of time.  Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 144"), which provides for an exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act under certain conditions, requires, among other conditions, a six month holding period prior to the resale (in limited amounts) of securities acquired in a non-public offering without having to satisfy the registration requirements under the Securities Act.  There can be no assurance that we will fulfill any reporting requirements in the future under the Exchange Act or disseminate to the public any current financial or other information concerning us.

If the Company uses its stock in acquisitions of other entities there may be substantial dilution at the time of a transaction. 
 
The offering price of the common stock we sold under our prospectus, and more recently as a private placement of restricted shares of our common stock to raise working capital, was arbitrarily set. The price did not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings or net worth and it is not an indication of actual value. You may also suffer additional dilution in the future from the sale of additional shares of common stock or other securities or if the Company's shares are issued to purchase other assets or to raise additional working capital. 
 
The laws which govern merger transactions provide that since our sole director and officer owns over 50% of our outstanding shares, we may enter into a share exchange, reverse merger or other similar transaction with a private company in an unrelated business without the prior approval of unaffiliated shareholders. 
 
The various securities laws applicable to our company provide that our management may elect to enter and consummate a transaction to enter new or additional businesses. In that event, our shareholders might receive only an information statement with certain disclosures as required by law and would likely not be in a position to approve or disapprove the transaction. Investors who are unwilling to accept the uncertainty of new management, a new business plan, likely dilution and all the numerous related uncertainties that may materialize in the event such a transaction is consummated should not purchase our shares. 
 
Risk of insolvency due to loss of our sole real estate asset and related revenues.
 
The principle balance on the sellers note financing of our warehouse is now considered a current payable on our balance sheet. If we are unable to either renegotiate terms of the balloon note, sell or refinance our warehouse prior to September 15, 2019, (on which date the entire $777,225 principal balance is due) , we could lose our ware house in foreclosure, or alternatively be forced to return our deed to the seller in lieu of foreclosure. Loss of our biggest asset would be accompanied by a forfeiture of equity we have built during the last five years. Additionally, we would suffer a significant and abrupt loss of the net revenues now generated. We have no present plan for replacement of this real property or the net revenue it generates.
 
We risk insolvency if revenues decline sharply and we are unable pay our bills and unable to timely locate and negotiate a suitable business combination or capital injection. 
 
Management recently has an elevated concern over potentially unfavorable events and related sharp reductions in revenues. If such problems occurs, we will first reduce expenses, conserve cash and endeavor to replace lost revenue. In anticipation of possible problems of this nature, and alternatively to grow our business when opportunity presents, management has redoubled its negotiations in connection with potential business combinations and continues to explore other means of raising cash. Our goal is to develop cash reserves, either for expansion, or to cover shortfalls in revenue. Management believes that ultimately, consummation of one or more such transactions would serve the best interests of shareholders; however, there is no assurance that we can locate or consummate a suitable business combination or otherwise provide for liquidity, expanded working capital and a stronger balance sheet.


There is presently a very limited market for our common stock.  Failure to maintain a trading market could negatively effect the value of our shares and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.
 
Our common stock has been assigned a trading symbol, "HMTF." As of December 31, 2108, our common shares are quoted on OTC Pinks Current. There is no cost of such quotation and related services from OTC Markets, Inc. Trading activity in our shares remains sporadic and there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets for our common stock, the ability of holders of our common stock to sell our common stock, or the prices at which holders may be able to sell our common stock. 
 
Failure to maintain an active trading market could negatively affect the value of our shares and make it difficult for you to sell your shares or recover any part of your investment in our shares. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile.  In addition to the uncertainties relating to our future operating performance and the profitability of our operations, factors such as variations in our interim financial results, or various, and as yet unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

Our common stock is still presently subject to the "Penny Stock" rules of the SEC.
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a "penny stock," for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:
 

· | that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:
 

· | obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:
 

· | sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.
