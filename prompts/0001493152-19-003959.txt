The Company also owns NetThruster, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“NetThruster”), which was formally known as Ludicrous, Inc. (“Ludicrous”). On January 28, 2011, the Board of Directors of Global Tech adopted resolutions approving the disposition by the Company of all the common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, NetThruster, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NetThruster Delaware”), in a spin-off to Global Tech’s shareholders on a pro rata basis (the “Spin-Off”). Thereafter, NetThruster Delaware would be owned by Global Tech’s shareholders. David Reichman, the CEO of Global Tech was named Chairman of the Board, CEO and CFO of NetThruster Delaware. Kathy M. Griffin was named a Director and corporate secretary. The Board of Directors of NetThruster Delaware is comprised of David Reichman and Kathy Griffin. On February 9, 2011, Global Tech entered into a distribution agreement with NetThruster Delaware (the “Distribution Agreement”). The Spin-Off is governed by the Distribution Agreement. A copy of the Distribution Agreement is attached by reference. The Spin-Off was disclosed in a Form 8-K, filed on February 9, 2011, which announced that the NetThruster division would be spun-off into a separate entity. Subsequently, management and the board of directors agreed to postpone the spin-off indefinitely
 
On May 25, 2011Global Tech signed a licensing agreement with WorldWithoutBlindness (“WWB”) for the right to market and sell their patented eye screening equipment on a global basis outside the United States, for a period of two years. Eye Care Centers International, Inc, was formed to support the further growth and development of (“WWB”), an organization whose primary mission is to bring patented eye screening equipment to the developing world.

On December 31, 2012, Global Tech and its new subsidiary, TTII Oil & Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, signed a binding asset purchase agreement with American Resource Technologies, Inc. (“ARUR”), a Kansas corporation, to acquire all the assets of ARUR for a purchase price of $513,538, which was paid in the form of shares of Global Tech’s common stock as described in the asset purchase agreement, which was disclosed in a Form 8 – K and is attached as an exhibit incorporated by reference. Subsequent to the Company’s purchase of the assets and the termination of the operator, a mechanics lien was filed against the property claiming approximately $267,000 in fees are due to the previous operator. At December 31, 2012, due to the lien, the Company impaired the recorded cost, leaving no value associated with the acquisition. See Note 11 for detail of the assets acquired from ARUR. An action is pending in the District Court of Chautauqua County, Kansas, captioned Aesir Energy, Inc. vs. American Resource Technologies, Inc.; Nancy Ownbey Archer; Jimmy Stephen Ownbey; Robbie Faye Butts; Tree Top Industries, Inc.; and TTII oil & Gas, Inc. Management intends to vigorously contest AESIR’s claims and, at this point, settlement appears unlikely. It has been presented in the County Court that some of ARUR’s Directors have acted without authorization in this matter. No monetary claims have been asserted against Global Tech or TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. The Company has made several attempts to recover the shares of GTII stock paid to ARUR for the asset acquisition and the various costs and expenses expended by GTII in fulfillment of its obligations under the contract with ARUR. The failure of non-litigation attempts to resolve the matter resulted in filing an action for declaratory judgment in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, case#17-CV-0698. As of this writing the case has not yet been decided.
 
On December 30, 2016, Global Tech Industries Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, executed a stock purchase agreement (the “Agreement”), which was signed and closed in Hong Kong, with GoFun Group, Ltd. through its wholly owned subsidiary Go F & B Holdings, Ltd. GoFun Group, Ltd. is a privately held company running a casual dining restaurant business, based in Hong Kong. Subsequent to the agreement being signed, GoFun Group failed to substantially perform under the agreement, including, but not limited to providing audited financials of its assets, making the ongoing payments called for in the agreement, along with other matters that led Global Tech to initiate litigation in the United States. Currently, Global Tech and GoFun are litigating the matter in the U.S District Court for the southern district of New York. As of this writing the case has not yet been decided.

Organizational History
 
We were incorporated in 1980 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Western Exploration, Inc. Western Exploration, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed on July 24, 1980. In 1990, Western Exploration, Inc. changed its name to Nugget Exploration, Inc. On November 10, 1999, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nugget Exploration, Inc., Nugget Holdings Corporation merged with and into GoHealthMD, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Shortly thereafter, Nugget Exploration, Inc. changed its name to GoHealthMD, Inc. a Nevada corporation.
 
On August 18, 2004, GoHealthMD, Inc., the Nevada Corporation, changed its name to Tree Top Industries, Inc. On July 7, 2016, Tree Top Industries, Inc. changed its name to Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. GoHealthMD, Inc. continues to exist as a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. NetThruster, Inc. MLN, Inc., BioEnergy Applied Technologies, Inc. (BAT”), Eye Care Centers International, Inc., GoHealthMD Nano Pharmaceuticals, Inc., TTI Strategic Acquisitions and Equity Group, Inc. and TTII Oil & Gas, Inc, all were formed by Global Tech in the anticipation of technologies, products or services being acquired. G T International, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Tech Industries Group, Inc., existing as a Wyoming corporation. Not all subsidiaries are currently active.
 
On December 31, 2012, Global Tech and its new subsidiary, TTII Oil & Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, signed a binding asset purchase agreement with American Resource Technologies, Inc. (“ARUR”), a Kansas corporation, to acquire all the assets of ARUR for a purchase price of $513,538, which was paid in the form of 466,853 shares of Global Tech’s common stock as described in the asset purchase agreement. The shares were valued at $1.10 per share, based on the closing trading price of the common stock on the Closing Date. The assets purchased from ARUR include a 75% working interest in oil and gas leases in Kansas, as well as other oil field assets, a natural gas pipeline, currently shut down that is also located in Kansas, 25% interest in three other business entities operating in Kansas, and accounts receivables from two companies operating in Brazil in the amounts of $3,600,000 and $3,600,000 respectively. TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. also purchased three promissory notes in the amounts of $100,000, $100,000 and $350,000, as well an overdue contract for revenue in the amount of $1,000,000. Finally, a gun sight patent was also acquired from Century Technologies, Inc. TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. intends to pursue more opportunities in Kansas to expand the current leases, and to aggressively continue pumping oil from the thirteen currently operating wells. At the same time, both Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. and TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. intend to aggressively pursue the two companies located in Brazil, who are responsible for the over $7,000,000 dollars in monies owed to TTII Oil & Gas, Inc. All accounts and notes receivable were deemed uncollectable due to the age and circumstances, and therefore were assessed no value in the asset purchase. The equity ownerships were also deemed to be impaired due to the inactive nature of the entities, and were not allocated any value. The gun sight patent was also not readily assessable as to value and no purchase price was allocated to this asset. Also, due to the mechanic’s lien and lawsuit on the oil leases, as well as the absence of an official reserve report, the oil lease was also impaired and no value was recorded for this asset. On September 2015, the Chautauqua County Court decided that American Resource Technologies Inc management and Board of Directors improperly acted and rendered the original Agreement a nullity. The Company has made several attempts to recover the shares of GTII stock paid to ARUR for the asset acquisition and the various costs and expenses expended by GTII in fulfillment of its obligations under the contract with ARUR. The failure of non-litigation attempts to resolve the matter resulted in filing an action for declaratory judgment in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, case#17-CV-0698. As of this writing the case has not yet been decided.

Research and Development
 
Although Global Tech’s staff is limited, it continues to monitor new developments and any emerging technologies.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Global Tech’s success depends in part upon its ability to protect its core technology and other intellectual capital. To accomplish this, Global Tech relies on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain registrations and contractual protections. With the acquisition of Adesso Biosciences, Global Tech will have acquired two patents, associated intellectual properties, and other proprietary information in the field of molecular science.
 
With the acquisition of BAT, Global Tech acquired fifteen (15) intellectual properties pertaining to the construction of the mobile configuration and operation of the glyd-arc medical waste destruction unit, as well as an enhanced configuration and novel method for coal gasification.
 
As of December 31, 2012, pursuant to the ARUR asset purchase agreement, Global Tech purchased eight related patents for various features of a gun sight, as applied to different types of firearms. The Company has not had time to determine any viable use of the patents and has not assigned a value to this intangible asset. Other than this purchased patent, Global Tech had received no patents in the United States and no patents in foreign jurisdictions. Global Tech has no pending patent applications in the United States and no pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. It had received no trademarks and had no pending trademark applications in the United States. It had no pending trademark applications in foreign countries and no non-U.S. trademark applications had been issued.
 
Global Tech generally controls access to and use of its software and other confidential information through (a) the use of internal and external controls, including physical and electronic security, contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and (b) domestic and foreign copyright laws.
 
There is currently no use or activity involving the intellectual properties of the Company, and accordingly, there is no recorded value assigned to these assets.
 
Government Regulation
 
BAT
 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), no registration of the BAT system is required because the waste destruction process does not involve incineration. Incineration processes are subject to regulation by the EPA. However, any hazardous waste destruction system that is constructed will be subject to the state laws and regulations where the system is located, as well as any regulations pertaining to the storage, transporting and/or destroying hazardous waste. BAT is also subject to government laws and regulations governing health, safety, working conditions, employee relations, wrongful termination, wages, taxes and other matters applicable to businesses in general.

NetThruster
 
NetThruster is subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the telecommunications and Internet industries. Laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce conducted over the Internet are becoming more prevalent, both in the United States and internationally, and may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online or providing Internet-related services such as ours. The laws relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on or disseminated through their networks are unsettled, both in the United States and abroad. Network operators have been sued in the past, sometimes successfully, based on the content of material disseminated through their networks. The Federal Trade Commission and equivalent state agencies regulate advertising and representations made by businesses in the sale of their products, which apply to us. NetThruster is also subject to government laws and regulations governing health, safety, working conditions, employee relations, wrongful termination, wages, taxes and other matters applicable to businesses in general.
 
GoHealthMD Nano Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of biologic products. All our foreseeable product candidates are expected to be regulated.
Oil & Gas Properties
 
Oil and gas properties are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations in the United States. Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies have issued extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Such laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and gas drilling, gas processing plants and production activities, increase the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Inasmuch as new legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is commonplace and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations. A breach or violation of such laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. At present, we do not believe that compliance with environmental legislation and regulations will have a material effect on our operations; however, any changes in environmental legislation or regulations or in our activities may cause compliance with such legislation and/or regulation to have a material impact on our operation. In addition, certain types of operations require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that means stricter standards, and enforcement, fines and penalties for non-compliance are becoming more stringent. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and directors, officers and employees. The cost of compliance with changes in governmental regulations has a potential to reduce the profitability of operations. We intend to ensure that we comply fully with all environmental regulations relating to our operations.
Restaurant Properties
 
The Hotel, Restaurant, and Food Service Industries in Hong Kong are subject to many of the same government ordinances and regulations that are prevalent in the United States and other western countries, among them food safety, wages, tips and taxes, child and teen labor, immigration, disabilities protection, proper labelling and storage of food, and applicable building safety codes.

Competition
 
BAT
 
There are currently no direct competitors offering this new and novel technology into the waste destruction market. The major companies that deal in hazardous waste management are companies such as Waste Management, Inc. Those companies treat, haul and store hazardous waste in landfills across the country. Some companies destroy hazardous waste, or any carbon-based waste in general, through incineration, which produces a significant carbon footprint and can be as expensive as the storing model. The competitive disadvantage for the BAT process is that it is uncommercialized technology at present, which makes the process of acquiring adequate funding more difficult.
 
NetThruster
 
The content delivery network market is highly competitive and is characterized by constantly declining prices and multiple types of vendors offering varying combinations of computing and bandwidth to content providers. A few of NetThruster’s current competitors, as well as a number of NetThruster’s potential competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and industry alliances, and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
 
GoHealthMD Nano Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
This subsidiary has been organized for the future acquisition of companies involved in the treatment of human disease through nanotechnology and molecular diagnostics. However, such acquisitions have not yet been completed. Therefore, this subsidiary is currently inactive with no operations. However, other companies, such as Nanoshpere, Inc., are in the treatment of human disease through nanotechnology and the molecular diagnostics industry.
Oil  & Gas Properties:
 
Oil and gas exploration, and acquisition of undeveloped properties are highly competitive and speculative businesses. We compete with a number of other companies, including major oil and gas companies and other independent operators that are more experienced and which have greater financial resources. We do not hold a significant competitive position in the oil and gas industry.
Restaurant Properties
 
The restaurant industry in Hong Kong has been growing rapidly, resulting in a highly competitive landscape. The Hong Kong consumer spends almost 60% of his food budget outside the home, paving the way for a competitive marketplace, as restaurants of all kinds compete for the same dollars. Our restaurants cover several different representations of typical Hong Kong restaurant offerings and the Company believes this diversification will result in positive growth in 2019.
Employees
 
. As of December 31, 2018, we employed two people, one on a full-time basis, and one on a part-time basis. Both employees are in executive positions.

Seasonality
 
Our operations are not expected to be affected by seasonal fluctuations, although our cash flow may be affected by fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts from our customers.
