ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Hayward” and “Company” mean Hayward Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context indicates another meaning). The term “common stock” means the common stock of Hayward Holdings, Inc., par value $0.001 per share.
Overview
We are an industry-leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad portfolio of pool equipment and associated automation systems. With the pool as the centerpiece of the growing outdoor living space, the pool industry has attractive market characteristics, including significant aftermarket requirements (such as the ongoing repair, replacement, remodeling and upgrading of equipment for existing pools), innovation-led growth opportunities and a favorable industry structure. We are a leader in this market with a highly-recognized brand, one of the largest installed bases of pool equipment in the world, decades-long relationships with our key channel partners and trade customers and a history of technological innovation. Our engineered products, which include various energy efficient and more environmentally sustainable offerings, enhance the pool owner’s outdoor living lifestyle while also delivering high quality water, pleasant ambiance and ease of use for the ultimate backyard experience. Aftermarket replacements and upgrades to higher value Internet of Things (“IoT”) and energy efficient models are a primary growth driver for our business, as we estimate that aftermarket sales represented approximately 80% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022 (“Fiscal Year 2022”). We estimate aftermarket sales based upon feedback from certain representative customers and management’s interpretation of available industry and government data, and not upon our GAAP net sales results.
Hayward Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in June 2017 in connection with the acquisition by CCMP Capital Advisors, LP (“CCMP”), MSD Partners, L.P. (“MSD Partners” and together with CCMP, the “Sponsors”) and Alberta Investment Management Corporation, as well as members of management and our board of directors, of our underlying business, which was founded in 1925. We completed our initial public offering of common stock in March 2021. 
We maintain an Internet website at global.hayward.com. We will make this annual report, in addition to our other annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, amendments to these reports, our proxy statements for meetings of our stockholders and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains these filings and they can be accessed via the Internet address https://www.sec.gov. Our corporate governance guidelines and the charters for each of our standing board committees (audit, nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees) are also available on our website, and copies of this information are available in print to any stockholder who requests it. Information included on or linked to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report.
Segments
We operate in a global pool equipment market with an installed base that we estimate to be approximately 25 million pools globally. North America and Europe are the two largest pool markets, accounting for an estimated 68% of the total global installed base and 84% of total equipment sales according to market studies. 
Our business is organized into two reportable segments: North America (“NAM”) and Europe & Rest of World (“E&RW”). We determined our operating segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. NAM and E&RW accounted for approximately 84% and 16% and 83% and 17% of total net sales for Fiscal Year 2022 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (“Fiscal Year 2021”), respectively. For financial information with respect to our business segments, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 12. “Segments and Related Information” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Item 7 contains information about sales and profits for each segment, and Note 12. “Segments and Related Information” contains information about each segment’s sales, capital expenditures, and depreciation.
North America 
Our North American business segment consists of the United States and Canada. We have residential and commercial field based teams selling directly to specialized pool distributors, large retailers, major builders and specialized online resellers. U.S. trade customer shipments are fulfilled from either our East Coast or West Coast distribution centers depending on the customer’s location. Canadian trade customers are served through our distribution center in Oakville, Ontario.
Europe and Rest of World 
Our Europe and Rest of World business segment consists of all countries outside of the United States and Canada. Europe and Australia make up a sizable portion of this business segment. Europe and Australia have similar sales structures to the United States. Customer shipments in Europe are fulfilled through our France or Spain distribution centers and Australia has its own smaller regional distribution hubs. The other 20+ countries in this segment are predominantly served through U.S.-based regional managers who in turn deal through established distributors in each of the markets. Products are consolidated into containers and shipped to global locations from the United States.
Products and Services
Since our founding in 1925, we have been delivering a growing portfolio of pool equipment that is differentiated by innovative features and high quality. Our broad portfolio of pool equipment and associated automation systems are connected through built-in IoT capabilities, many of which form part of the SmartPad™ platform of advanced IoT enabled products. Our products perform various core and auxiliary functions to deliver the holistic pool experience for pool owners.
Full Spectrum of Pool Equipment
We offer a wide range of pool equipment, including single and high efficiency variable speed pumps, filters, robotic, suction and pressure cleaners, high efficiency gas heaters and heat pumps, LED illumination solutions, water features and landscape lighting, water sanitizers, salt chlorine generators, safety equipment and in-floor automated cleaning systems. Our products are connected through OmniLogic, our mobile application that allows our end users to conveniently manage their connected pool equipment.
Our more environmentally sustainable products provide increased value for pool owners through various advanced functions that help drive energy savings, minimize chemical usage and reduce water consumption. For example, our large-capacity cartridge pool filters conserve up to 92% more water than standard sand filters as they do not need to be backwashed. Given these advanced functions, we are able to charge a higher price on key products such as variable speed pumps, energy efficient heaters, efficient filters and LED lights. The addition of IoT based controls and alternative sanitizers, including salt chlorination systems and UV/Ozone systems, also increases the potential equipment spend on a pool pad while providing greater ease of use for pool owners and potential energy savings and chemical reduction. Pool owners are typically willing to pay higher prices upfront in order to enjoy functional product benefits and ultimate cost savings. Pool owners appreciate the more environmentally sustainable features and understand that they can expect a payback over several years. For example, the average payback period on a variable speed pump is approximately one to two years.
Our products cater to all types of pools including both in-ground and above ground pools. Our wide range of offerings can be found in entry, mid-range and premium pools. The average wholesale price of equipment per pool typically ranges from $1,800 for entry-level pools to well above $12,000 for premium pools, but equipment is only a fraction of the total pool cost. Approximately 50% of our net sales is derived from non-discretionary products that are essential to operating a residential or commercial pool.
Recent product development has targeted key pool industry trends such as energy efficiency, advanced sanitization, reduced chemical usage, water conservation and enhanced IoT-driven pool experiences.
Customers 
We sell our products through a variety of channels to a diverse global trade customer base. The majority of our sales are through specialty distributors, who in turn sell to thousands of pool builders and servicers. The remaining sales are directly to large retailers, pool builders and buying groups. Our largest customer, Pool Corporation, 
represented approximately 35% of our net sales in Fiscal Year 2022, but no other customer represented more than 10% of our net sales in Fiscal Year 2022. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We maintain longstanding relationships with approximately 700 suppliers. We mainly purchase assembled components such as motors, metal parts, cables and extrusions from our suppliers. We also purchase raw materials, such as resins (ABS, PP, HDPE, PVC), metals (copper, steel, aluminum, titanium, ruthenium) and liner board (packaging), which expose us to changes in commodity pricing and the availability of materials within the global supply chain. We seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in commodity prices through our agreements with our suppliers that typically provide for fixed pricing over a three to 12-month period to manage raw material inflation. We have dedicated supply chain employees who manage global sourcing, strategic consolidation and supplier relationships. We typically perform an audit on any new suppliers, and periodically evaluate our existing supplier base to ensure maximum service and quality. Our supplier base is “sticky” as suppliers must invest to receive certain approvals, creating an economic incentive to maintain a long and productive relationship.
We have had an average relationship of over 15 years across our top 30 suppliers. We have had a 40+ year relationship with our top vendor and 10+ year relationships with 8 out of our top 10 suppliers, with an average of 16 years of supply continuity. 
Sales Channels 
The pool equipment market is served through several sales channels.
Distributors: The majority of our net sales comes from an authorized network of regional and national distributors who service the pool trade (i.e., builders, retailers and servicers). We have long-standing relationships with these trade customers and we have contractual agreements to support our continued net sales of our products through this channel. Distributors are responsible for ordering, stocking, training, delivering and taking on credit responsibility from their trade customers. Many distributors also sell our products to online retailers.
Builders, Retailers and Servicers (Direct Sales): We sell to several major builders and retailers. These customers are large in scale and are capable of managing their own demand planning and inventory. Builders and retailers who buy directly from us typically cross geographies beyond what many wholesalers can serve. 
Buying Groups: We sell to several major buying groups, which are composed of members who are independent businesses. Buying groups receive competitive pricing and special incentives. Members can place orders with the group’s corporate headquarters or order from us directly. We ship directly to member locations.
According to management estimates, in Fiscal Year 2022 approximately 75% of residential pool equipment in the United States is sold through specialty distributors such as Pool Corporation, Heritage Pool Supply Group, and Baystate Pool Supplies. Approximately 18% was sold directly to retailers, and approximately 7% was sold to builders. In Europe, the sales channel is more direct than in the United States as approximately 70% of sales are through distributors and 30% are through direct sales.
Across regions, the market is based on a “prescriber model.” The purchasing decisions of the end consumer (i.e., pool owners) are strongly influenced by pool builders and pool servicers.
Buying patterns through the various sales channels discussed above can also affect our sales for a given period. The level of inventory held by our distributor and retail customers is based upon factors beyond our control, such as end-user sales, supply chain lead times and macroeconomic factors, which may cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period. 
Seasonality 
Our business is seasonal with sales typically higher in the second and fourth quarters. During the second quarter of a fiscal year, sales are higher in anticipation of the start of the summer pool season. In the fourth quarter, we incentivize trade customers to buy and stock up in preparation for next year’s pool season under an “early buy” program that offers a price discount and extended payment terms. Under the early-buy program in 2022, we generally shipped products from October through March and receive payments for these shipments from February through July 2023.
Our aim is to keep our manufacturing plants running at a consistent level throughout the year. Consequently, we typically build inventory in the first and third quarters and inventory is typically sold-down in the second and fourth quarters. Our accounts receivable balance increases from October to April as a result of the early-buy extended terms and remains elevated through June due to higher sales in the second quarter. We typically utilize our asset-based lending facility in the first quarter to finance our operating expenses, and reduce our credit utilization in the second quarter as the seasonality of our business peaks and payments are received.
Weather can affect our sales, however we primarily serve the aftermarket, which is less affected than new pool construction equipment sales. Unseasonably cold weather or significant amounts of rainfall can suspend new pool construction and reduce the sale of pool equipment to new-pool builders.
For discussion regarding the effects seasonality had on our results of operations in Fiscal Year 2022, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Trends and Uncertainties Regarding Our Existing Business.”
Competition 
The markets for our products are geographically diverse and highly competitive. We compete against large and well-established national and global companies, as well as regional and local niche original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and lower cost manufacturers. Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve, offering products that compete with us. Our competitors offer pool equipment of varied quality and across a wide range of retail price points.
We compete based on brand recognition with distributors, retailers, pool builders and pool owners, strong relationships with our distributors and resellers, and the loyalty of our builders and servicers with whom we have built a large installed base. We offer our Totally Hayward loyalty program, an incentive-based program that allows us to better connect with our trade partners and drive expansion across our product lines and across our international markets. In addition, we compete based on our technical innovation, intellectual property, reputation for providing quality and reliable products, competitive pricing and contractual terms. We believe our extensive inventory of products enables us to meet both residential and commercial needs, which creates a one-stop-shop for many of our trade partners. Some of our competitors, in particular smaller companies, compete based primarily on price and local relationships, especially with respect to products that do not require significant engineering or technical expertise. 
Some geographic markets we serve, particularly the four largest and higher pool density U.S. markets of California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, have a greater concentration of competition than other U.S. markets. The European pool equipment market is generally more fragmented.
Intellectual Property 
Patents and trademarks are important to our business. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 209 issued U.S. patents and 231 issued foreign patents relating to our technologies, such as pumps, filters, heaters, drains and white goods, robotic cleaners, in-floor cleaning systems, lights, automation and controls, sanitization, valves and flow control, and IoT and other technologies, as well as approximately 135 U.S. trademark registrations and 714 foreign trademark registrations covering our marks, brands and products. As of December 31, 2022, we also held approximately 59 pending U.S. patent applications, 78 pending foreign patent applications, 9 pending U.S. trademark applications and 41 pending foreign trademark applications. We also license patents to certain technologies used in our products, such as our pool cleaner and lighting products.
We also have a brand enforcement program under which we monitor and pursue action against unauthorized online resales and infringements of our intellectual property, such as our trademark rights. When needed, we send cease and desist letters, which frequently result in the desired compliance without the need for litigation. From time to time, we initiate litigation on these matters as a means to enforce our rights.
We do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent or proprietary technology. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.
Human Capital Resources 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,000 total full-time equivalent employees of whom approximately 1% are temporary or contract workers. Our total number of temporary and contract workers fluctuates due to business cycles during the year. We believe our ability to maintain a flexible, modular workforce enhances our manufacturing capabilities. Our employees are primarily located in the United States, with about 25% employed at our international locations in Canada, Spain, France, Australia and China. As of December 31, 2022, none of our employees were represented by a union in the United States and we have relationships with works councils in Spain and France.
As part of our human capital resource objectives, we seek to attract, retain, develop and reward our employees through a variety of mechanisms. We build upon Hayward’s objectives by seeking to attract, retain, develop and reward behaviors to ensure our long-term sustainability as a company. We continue to advance our efforts to develop a performance culture by strengthening performance management processes through management training and the development and implementation of consistent documentation and methodologies designed to ensure a robust process for all employees. We schedule performance discussions for all employees each year, and establish clearly defined goals and incentive programs to drive employee performance. In addition, we have implemented a coordinated approach in managing our overall compensation structure and regularly conduct full evaluations of our compensation and incentive programs to ensure we are competitive in these areas. We monitor our performance by measuring numerous elements relating to our human capital management efforts, including, but not limited to, employee turnover, time to fill open roles and general diversity statistics.
Information Systems 
We believe that our website and information technology systems are equipped to support the operation of our business and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and protect our information technology systems.
Data Privacy and Security 
We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure and protection of certain types of data. Such regulations include state data breach notification laws, California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and Australia’s Privacy Act, amongst others. Additionally, our evolution into offering smart products that can connect to the IoT may subject us to other IoT-specific laws and regulations, including the California Internet of Things Security Law. Because of our marketing activities, we may also be subject to applicable marketing privacy laws, including the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the “CAN-SPAM Act”) and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the “TCPA”), among others.
These laws and regulations are increasing in number and complexity, and are subject to varying interpretations by regulators and the courts, resulting in higher risk of enforcement, fines, and other penalties.
We have taken steps to monitor and comply with changing requirements. For example, we maintain an updated website privacy policy that explains our online information collection and use practices and applicable rights of European Union and California residents under the GDPR and CCPA, respectively. We also take reasonable efforts to implement and maintain security controls to align with industry standards.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
Our operations are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental, health and safety matters, including employee health and safety, in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental, health and safety regulations that apply to operations at one or more of our United States facilities include, without limitation, regulations promulgated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Environmental Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures requirements and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) concerning employee health and safety matters. In addition, we and certain of our affiliates store certain types of hazardous materials and chemicals at various locations and the storage of these items 
is strictly regulated by local fire codes. We also sell UV, Ozone, and Salt Chlorinator and related products that are regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), which primarily relates to testing, use, reporting, sale, distribution, licensing and market verification of these products. Moreover, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “USEPA”), OSHA, and other federal and foreign, state and/or local agencies have the authority to promulgate laws and regulations in the future that may impact our operations going forward. In addition to the federal environmental laws identified above that apply to our operations, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes (and others), and under state corollaries to the federal laws, to regulate environmental, health and safety matters at our U.S. facilities. Compliance with, or liabilities under, such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and could affect various aspects of the business.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
As a leading provider of environmentally friendly and energy efficient products, Hayward strives to promote sustainability throughout our business operations. We believe that a healthy environment is necessary for the well-being of our people and our businesses and is the foundation for a sustainable and strong economy. Championing our core environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values, we are committed to providing innovative and environmentally sustainable products, upholding responsible manufacturing practices, fostering a safe and inclusive workplace, and maintaining strong governance and compliance practices. 
We recognize the risks and challenges that are associated with climate change. As a leading provider of environmentally friendly and energy efficient products in our industry, we are committed to upholding a mission of sustainability throughout our operations and within our culture. We strive to provide environmentally friendly, innovative, and energy efficient products without compromising our planet, our people, and our principles. 
We take our responsibility for environmental stewardship seriously and believe as a global designer and manufacturer, we play a constructive role in helping to address environmental challenges. In 2022, we established four pillars to guide our approach to ESG based on the results of our assessment of the ESG priorities that are important to our stakeholders: Products, People, Planet, and Principles. We are working to assess our current ESG performance in order to set goals that will guide our continued efforts and progress. As part of our first steps towards sustainability reporting, we published an inaugural ESG Tearsheet and enhanced our communication on our ESG webpage.
Hayward respects, values and celebrates the unique attributes, characteristics and perspectives that make each person who they are, and we believe that the success of our employees determines the success of our business. An inclusive and diverse workforce enables different perspectives to be shared and supports a collaborative and engaged company culture. 
We believe that bringing diverse individuals together allows us to more effectively address the challenges that may face our organization. We are committed to building a community where we all share a common purpose and a collective responsibility to ensure the well-being of individuals and the Company through mutual respect and mutual learning. Hayward has created a global diversity and inclusion platform and strategy focused on creating awareness and to enable our management accountability. Our people are fundamental to our long-term business success. We strive to attract, retain, develop and reward our employees by continuously enhancing various employee-focused initiatives while incorporating diversity and inclusivity into our hiring practices. We pride ourselves on our robust and comprehensive OSHA-aligned safety standards and go a step further to create an open feedback culture. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, over 550 employees’ suggestions for improvements have been implemented and we conduct regular town hall meetings. 
We also are proud of our employee development programs, which include a variety of skill trainings for our employees to advance in their careers and develop leaders from within the Company. Our regular and transparent performance discussions with all employees also serve to ensure our compensation and incentive programs remain competitive and ensure sustainable growth for our business.
To enable good governance, Hayward’s ESG strategy is governed by our Board of Directors through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our ESG Steering Committee comprises members of the senior leadership team and meets on a monthly cadence to oversee our ESG efforts. In 2022, the Committee on Policy Review and Approvals, revised, adopted and published several key ESG policies, including a management revised 
Environmental Policy, a revised Supplier Code of Conduct, a revised Human Rights Policy and a new Conflict Minerals Policy. We are committed to transparency and communications to our stakeholders. 
We maintain an ESG section of our website (https://investor.hayward.com/ESG/default.aspx) to provide detailed information to interested groups. 
Regulatory Matters 
We are also subject to foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to matters such as product labeling, weights and measures, zoning, land use, and fire codes, including regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Fire Protection Agency, and the Federal Trade Commission. Most of these requirements govern the packaging, labeling, handling, transportation, storage, sale and use of our products. In addition, we are subject to regulation passed by the U.S. Department of Energy (the “DOE”) relating to the labeling, testing, reporting and certification of new and replacement pumps sold for swimming pools. Compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly and could affect various aspects of the business.
