Item 1. Business.
General Description of Business.  Arcosa, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Arcosa,” “Company,” “we,” or “our”) headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions. We provide critical products for a broad spectrum of markets throughout construction, energy, and transportation. We own businesses with well-established positions in attractive markets with favorable long-term demand drivers, which should provide us with compelling organic and acquisition opportunities. 
Arcosa is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2018 in connection with the separation of Arcosa from Trinity Industries, Inc. (“Trinity” or “Former Parent”) on November 1, 2018 as an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “Separation”). At the time of the Separation, Arcosa consisted of certain of Trinity’s former construction products, energy equipment, and transportation products businesses. The Separation was effectuated through a pro rata dividend distribution on November 1, 2018 of all of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Arcosa to the holders of common stock of Trinity as of October 17, 2018, the record date for the distribution.
Our principal executive offices are located at 500 N. Akard Street, Suite 400, Dallas, Texas 75201. Our telephone number is 972-942-6500, and our Internet website address is www.arcosa.com. We make available on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Information on our Investor Relations page and on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other securities filings unless specifically incorporated herein by reference. 
Overview. As a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions, we manufacture or process and sell a variety of products principally including:

 | Construction Products | Energy Equipment | Transportation Products 
Primary products | •Natural aggregates•Lightweight aggregates•Specialty milled or processed materials•Trench shields and shoring products | •Wind towers•Utility structures•Storage tanks | •Inland barges•Fiberglass barge covers and other components•Axles and couplers for railcars and locomotives•Industrial and mining components 
Primary markets served | •Residential, commercial, and industrial construction•Road and bridge construction•Underground construction•Agriculture•Specialty building products | •Wind power generation•Power transmission and distribution•Gas and liquids storage for residential, agriculture, and industrial markets | •Transportation products serving numerous markets, including:•Agriculture/food products•Refined products•Chemicals•Upstream oil•Railcar manufacturers and maintenance operations

Recent Developments. On December 5, 2018, Arcosa completed the acquisition of ACG Materials (“ACG”), a producer of specialty materials and aggregates, with operations in Oklahoma, Texas, Nevada, Washington, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, and British Columbia. The acquisition of ACG expanded our geographic and product diversity beyond our existing natural and lightweight aggregates markets and introduced new markets including agricultural and specialty building products. The purchase price of $309.1 million was funded with a combination of cash on-hand and a $180 million borrowing under Arcosa's $400 million five-year credit facility. 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company divested certain businesses whose revenues are included in the other component of the Energy Equipment Group. The net proceeds from these divestitures were not significant. We concluded that the divestiture of these businesses does not represent a strategic shift that would result in a material effect on our operations and financial results; therefore, these disposals have not been reflected as discontinued operations in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Our Segments. We serve our customers through the following three business groups: 
Construction Products Group.
Markets
 Our Construction Products Group provides products that are used in multiple areas of construction infrastructure. Our products are used across the construction landscape including residential, commercial, industrial, road and bridge, and underground construction. As the United States ("U.S.") continues to experience population growth and replace its aging infrastructure, we believe our businesses are well-positioned to benefit from this activity. Additionally, our products are used in certain agricultural and energy markets.
Products, Customers, and Competitors
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Construction Products Group produces and sells construction aggregates including natural aggregates and specialty materials and construction site support equipment including trench shields and shoring products. See Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to construction aggregates products.
We are an established producer and distributor of natural aggregates serving both public infrastructure and private construction markets. Our natural aggregates products include sand, gravel, limestone, gypsum, and various other products used in the production of ready mixed concrete, cement, precast concrete products, roads, oil and gas well pads, wind farms, as well as various other building products. Our natural aggregates customers are concrete producers; commercial, residential, highway, and general contractors; manufacturers of masonry and building products; and state and local governments. We compete with natural aggregates producers in the regions where we operate.
Our specialty materials, including lightweight aggregates and milled or processed specialty building products and agricultural products, are produced and distributed nationwide. Our specialty materials products enjoy higher barriers to entry than our natural aggregates due to specific mineral properties, specialized manufacturing, or additional processing. Lightweight aggregates are select shales or clays that are expanded and hardened by high temperatures in a rotary kiln and possess a bulk density that can be less than half that of natural aggregates. Product applications include structural lightweight concrete, lightweight masonry block, and road surface treatments. Our specialty building products and agricultural products are processed at several production facilities across the U.S. using our natural aggregates as a component of raw material supply. Product applications include plasters, prills, agricultural supplements and fertilizers, paints, flooring, and glass. We compete with specialty materials producers nationwide.
We hold a strong market position in the manufacture of trench shields and shoring products for the U.S. construction industry. Trench shields and shoring products are used for water and sewer construction, utility installations, manhole work, oil and gas pipeline construction, and other underground applications. Our customers are equipment rental dealers and commercial, residential, and industrial contractors. Additionally, we participate in certain regional rental markets for trench shoring equipment. We compete with shoring products manufacturers nationwide. 
Raw Material and Suppliers
Natural aggregates can be found throughout the U.S., and many producers exist nationwide. Shipments of natural aggregates from an individual quarry are generally limited in geographic scope because the cost of transportation to customers is high relative to the value of the product itself. Raw materials for specialty material products are also from quarries; however, due to the added value in processing, they have a much wider, multi-state distribution area due to their higher value relative to their distribution costs. We currently operate mining facilities located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Colorado, California, Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Washington, Nevada, and British Columbia.
Energy Equipment Group.
Markets
Our Energy Equipment Group serves a broad spectrum of energy markets, including wind power generation, electricity transmission and distribution, and the storage and transportation of gas and liquid products for use in residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial end markets.
Products, Customers, and Competitors
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Energy Equipment Group manufactures structural wind towers; utility steel structures for electricity transmission and distribution; and storage and distribution tanks. See Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to wind towers and utility structures products.
We are one of the leading manufacturers of structural wind towers in the U.S. and Mexico. Our primary customers are wind turbine producers and we compete with both domestic and foreign producers of towers. Revenues from General Electric Company (“GE”) included in our Energy Equipment Group constituted 19.4%, 22.9%, and 22.4% of consolidated or combined revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

We are a well-established manufacturer in the U.S. and Mexico of steel utility structures for electricity transmission. Through our recognized brands, we have developed strong relationships with our primary customers, public and private utilities. We compete with both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
Additionally, our storage tanks support oil, gas, and chemical markets and are used by industrial plants, utilities, residences, and small businesses in suburban and rural areas. We also manufacture fertilizer storage containers for agricultural markets, including bulk storage, farm storage, and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia.
We are one of the primary manufacturers in North America of pressurized and non-pressurized tanks that store and transport a wide variety of products, including propane, anhydrous ammonia, and natural gas liquids. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal material used in our Energy Equipment manufacturing segment is steel. During 2018, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. Market steel prices continue to exhibit periods of volatility and ended 2018 higher than 2017. Steel prices may be volatile in the future in part as a result of market conditions. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profit for the year. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts.
Arcosa’s manufacturing operations also use component parts, such as flanges for wind towers. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels through more than one supplier and that our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts.
Transportation Products Group.
Markets
Our Transportation Products Group consists of established companies that supply manufactured steel products to the transportation industry. These transportation products serve a wide variety of markets, including the transportation of commodities such as grain, coal, aggregates, chemicals, fertilizers, petrochemicals, and refined products.
Products, Customers, and Competitors
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Transportation Products Group manufactures and sells inland barges, fiberglass barge covers, and marine hardware; and steel components for railcars and other transportation and industrial equipment. See Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to inland barges and steel components products.
We have a leading position in the U.S. market for the manufacture of inland barges and fiberglass barge covers. We manufacture a variety of hopper barges, tank barges, and fiberglass covers, and we provide a full line of deck hardware to the marine industry, including hatches, castings and winches for towboats and dock facilities. Dry cargo barges transport various commodities, such as grain, coal, and aggregates. Tank barges transport liquids including refined products, chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products. Our fiberglass reinforced lift covers are used primarily for grain barges. Our barge manufacturing facilities are located along the U.S. inland river systems, allowing for rapid delivery to our customers. Our customers are primarily commercial marine transportation companies and industrial shippers. We compete with a number of other manufacturers in the U.S.
We are a recognized manufacturer of steel components for railcars and other transportation equipment. We manufacture axles, circular forgings and coupling devices for freight, tank, locomotive and passenger rail transportation equipment, as well as other industrial uses, and also provide cast components for use in the industrial and mining sectors. Our customers are primarily freight and passenger railcar manufacturers, rail maintenance and repair facilities, railroads, steel mills, and mining equipment manufacturers. We compete with both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal material used in our Transportation Products manufacturing segment is steel. During 2018, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. Market steel prices continue to exhibit periods of volatility and ended 2018 higher than 2017. Steel prices may be volatile in the future in part as a result of market conditions. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profit for the year. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts.
Arcosa’s manufacturing operations also use component parts, such as pumps, engines, and hardware for tank barges. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels through more than one supplier and that our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts.

Unsatisfied Performance Obligations (Backlog). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our backlog of firm orders was as follows:

 | December 31,2018 | | December 31,2017
 | (in millions) 
Energy Equipment Group: | | | 
Wind towers and utility structures | $ | 633.1 | | $ | 899.0
Other | $ | 55.1 | | * | 
Transportation Products Group: | | | 
Inland barges | $ | 230.5 | | $ | 98.2 

* Prior to January 2018, contracts within the Other businesses of the Energy Equipment Group did not meet the Company's historical definition of backlog, which was firm, non-cancellable orders. With the adoption in January 2018 of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, these amounts are now included in backlog due to the fact that they contain substantive cancellation penalties.
Approximately 64% percent of unsatisfied performance obligations for our wind towers and utility structures in our Energy Equipment Group are expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2019 with the remainder to be delivered through 2020. All of the unsatisfied performance obligations for our other business lines in our Energy Equipment Group are expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2019. Approximately 94% percent of unsatisfied performance obligations for barges in our Transportation Products Group are expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2019 with the remainder to be delivered through 2020.
Marketing. We sell substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in multiple locations in the U.S. and Mexico. We also use independent sales representatives and distributors.
Employees. The following table presents the approximate headcount breakdown of employees by business group:
Business Group | December 31,2018
Construction Products Group | 1,159 
Energy Equipment Group | 3,366 
Transportation Products Group | 1,261 
Corporate | 103 
 | 5,889 

As of December 31, 2018, approximately 4,150 employees were employed in the U.S., 1,726 employees in Mexico, and 13 employees in Canada.
Seasonality. Results in our Construction Products Group are affected by seasonal fluctuations with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues.
Intellectual Property. Arcosa owns a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although Arcosa’s patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are important to Arcosa’s success, we do not regard our business as being dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Business and Operations.” 
Governmental Regulation.
Construction Products Group. Arcosa’s Construction Products Group is subject to regulation by the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), the Health-Safety and Reclamation Code of Ministry of Mines for British Columbia, and various state agencies.
Energy Equipment Group. Arcosa’s storage tanks are subject to the regulations by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and the U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), both of which are part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”). These agencies promulgate and enforce rules and regulations pertaining, in part, to the manufacture of tanks that are used in the storage, transportation and transport arrangement, and distribution of regulated and non-regulated substances.

Transportation Products Group. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Customs Service, the Maritime Administration of the USDOT, and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. These organizations establish safety criteria, investigate vessel accidents, and recommend improved safety standards. 
Our steel components businesses that serve the railcar industry are regulated by governmental agencies such as the USDOT and the administrative agencies it oversees, including the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and industry authorities such as the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”). All such agencies and authorities promulgate rules, regulations, specifications, and operating standards affecting rail-related safety standards for railroad equipment. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Similar Regulations. In addition to the regulations described above, our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and, within our Construction Products Group, MSHA. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims that may be asserted against Arcosa for work-related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
International Regulations. We ship raw materials to Mexico and manufacture products in Mexico that are sold in the U.S. or elsewhere, which are subject to customs and other regulations. In addition, we are subject to other governmental regulations and authorities in Mexico and other countries where we conduct business that regulate products manufactured, sold or used in those countries. 
Environmental, Health and Safety. We are subject to federal, state, and international environmental and safety and health laws and regulations in the U.S., Mexico, and each country in which we operate, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”). These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities.
We cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding reserves for environmental matters.
See Item 1A for further discussion of risk factors with regard to environmental, governmental, and other matters.
