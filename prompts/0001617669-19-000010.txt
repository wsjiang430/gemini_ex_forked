On the same date, Unique Fabricating NA, Inc., purchased 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Intasco USA, Inc. (together the two entities purchased are referred to as “Intasco”)
Initial Public Offering (the “IPO”)
On July 7, 2015, we completed our IPO of 2,702,500 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $9.50 per share, including 352,500 shares subject to an over-allotment option granted to the underwriters. After underwriting discounts, commissions, and approximate fees and expenses of the offering, we received net IPO proceeds of approximately $22.2 million. We used part of these proceeds to repay the $13.1 million principal amount of our 16% senior subordinated note together with accrued interest through the date of payment. We used the remaining proceeds to temporarily reduce borrowings under the revolver portion of our then senior secured credit facility. Amounts paid under the facility remained available to be re-borrowed, subject to compliance with the terms of the facility. We also issued to the underwriters warrants to purchase up to 141,000 shares of common stock, as additional compensation in the IPO. The warrants are exercisable at a per share exercise price equal to 125% of the initial public offering price of $9.50 per share, and may be exercised until the date five years from the date of the IPO.
Automotive Industry Analysis and Industry Trends
The automotive parts industry provides components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, and had approximately $250 billion of North American annual revenue in 2016 according to a January 2017 Dun & Bradstreet report on the automotive supplier market. Based on North American vehicle production in 2018, which declined just over 5% from 2016 as noted in the chart below, the revenue in the automotive parts industry was approximates the $250 billion amount in 2018 as well. Within the automotive parts industry, North America is the Company’s core market. We manufacture multi-material foam, rubber, plastic components, and tape adhesive related products utilized in noise, vibration and harshness management, acoustical management, water and air sealing, decorative and other functional applications.
Demand for automotive parts in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive parts industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by increasing business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. We believe that as a company with a North American presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, we are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
Overall, we expect modest long-term growth of vehicle sales and production in the OEM market. The automobile industry in general in recent years has seen slight declines in customer sales and production volumes from the peak achieved in 2016. According to IHS Automotive, North American vehicle production declined during 2018 to 17.0 million units, a decrease of approximately 1.2% from vehicle production during 2017. Going forward, vehicle production is expected to be slightly lower in 2019 compared to 2018, however, IHS is currently projecting growth to 17.3 million units in 2023, as depicted in the following chart.

In addition to the modest overall industry growth, we believe there are a variety of trends that are influencing the future of the global automotive market. We believe that we are positively positioned to benefit from an increasing number of trends driven by market forces such as:

• | Fuel efficiency/vehicle light-weighting: Government mandates on fuel efficiency and emission reductions will continue to force the automotive industry to focus on improving the fuel economy of vehicles. This is one of the factors driving the trend of replacing conventional steel as the primary material in vehicle production with lighter weight materials, such as plastics and foams. In 2010, approximately 65% of vehicle content was made of conventional steel, but according to industry sources that percentage is expected to decrease by 10 – 20%, in the aggregate by 2025. 


• | Interior comfort: Comfort of interiors consistently rank in the top three factors that consumers consider when purchasing a new vehicle, and is a key area where vehicle manufactures can differentiate their vehicles. The comfort of the interior is an area of increased focus for OEM manufacturers with each new generation of vehicles. This trend is expected to continue to increase the use of foam and acoustical insulation in vehicles. 


• | Telematics and Infotainment: The increasing use of telematics and infotainment requires increasingly quieter vehicles for the telematics systems to recognize voice commands and passengers to enjoy the infotainment options. Over the next few years, approximately 80% of all new vehicles are expected to include voice recognition systems, increasing the need for quiet interiors. We expect that the result will be increased use of acoustic insulation materials, more precise air seals and other noise, vibration and harshness products in all vehicles. 


• | Rapid pace of new vehicle launches: In order to meet consumers’ increasing demand for new products, the automotive market will see a significant number of new program launches from vehicle manufacturers over the next few years. Each new vehicle launch creates new product opportunities for us because of the OEMs need for noise, vibration and harshness solutions as they discover unplanned noise issues at the launch of production for a new vehicle program. 


• | Localization of production: Due to freight costs, currency fluctuations, logistic issues and protection of supply, many foreign vehicle manufacturers have increased their production volumes in North America and are increasing local sourcing of vehicle components. We believe that Unique’s production facilities situated in geographic proximity to the majority of North American vehicle assembly locations provide a competitive advantage. 

We believe these market trends create opportunities for us to achieve above market growth rates as a result of increased content per vehicle, higher industry production volumes, geographic shifts in vehicle production, and evolving customer sourcing strategies. Our challenge is to continue developing leading edge solutions focused on addressing these trends, and applying those solutions via products with sustainable margins that enable our customers to produce distinctive market-leading products.

As an example of our innovative technical capabilities, we utilized our thermoforming process to develop and produce a line of lightweight flexible air duct systems for a leading OEM, providing an 80% weight reduction and enhanced functionality. This air duct system has developed into Unique’s patent pending TwinShape line of proprietary ducts. Unique has been awarded four additional production orders for the TwinShape line of ducts, adding three additional OEM customers since launching the product, and have secured development and prototyping contracts with four additional OEMs in the last few years for potential inclusion of this product in vehicle programs starting with model years 2019 and 2020 vehicles.
We generate a significant number of new sales opportunities from customer challenges, such as buzz, squeak, rattle (“BSR”) or noise, vibration and harshness (“NVH”) issues, discovered during the launch of production for a new vehicle program. In many of these situations, we develop and begin supplying a solution within days, a level of responsiveness that avoids competitive requests for quotations and produces premium value for our customers. Given the projected rapid pace of new vehicle launches over the next three years, we believe that we will benefit from an increasing number of opportunities sourced late in the launch cycle.
Appliance, HVAC, and Water Heater Industries
We are a leading provider of fabricated, non-metallic components to a diverse group of OEMs and tiered suppliers in the appliance, HVAC, and water heater industries. These sales represented approximately 10.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 30, 2018. These components are primarily manufactured from foam, adhesives, fiberglass, rubber and board-back material. We have extensive materials, engineering and fabrication expertise and deliver custom-designed, innovative solutions for our customers. Our component solutions primarily consist of products used in gasketing, heat deflection, packaging, insulation, water seals, noise reduction and vibration control. Demand for these end-market products is largely driven by the health of the housing sector. According to the U.S. Census bureau, there were 1.3 million new housing starts in 2018 and the National Association of Home Builders forecasts that there will be approximately another 1.3 million new housing starts in 2019. We believe that the appliance, HVAC, and water heater industries are currently primed for slightly favorable growth.
The United States major household appliance industry, which includes water heaters, is forecast to show modest growth during 2019, as new and existing home sales, as well as home improvement spending, both of which have a direct impact on appliance industry sales, continue to show positive outlooks. According to an independent source published in December 2018, forecasted revenue for this industry in the United States is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 1.1% from 2018 to 2023 to reach approximately $21.2 billion in revenue in 2023. The United States HVAC industry is also poised to benefit from the positive outlook in the housing and home improvement markets. According to an independent source published in November 2018, forecasted revenue for this industry is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 0.5% from 2018 to 2023 to reach approximately $48.8 billion in revenue in 2023. We believe these benefits will increase the demand for our products from existing clients including GE,Whirlpool, AO Smith, Rheem and Trane.

and creative resources and our rapid response capabilities to deliver rapid technical innovation, exceptional quality, reliable on-time delivery and competitive costs. We believe the key to our core competitive strengths are as follows:
Strong technical expertise.  We have tremendous depth of expertise and knowledge of materials, adhesives, manufacturing processes and the product applications of our customers. Our understanding of our customers’ design and performance needs, and how our products interface with their applications allows us to engineer effective product solutions. We believe that our engineering talent, test facilities and rapid prototyping capabilities distinguish us from our competitors and enable us to rapidly innovate and develop products that resolve customers’ problems, often within 24 to 48 hours. By understanding our customers’ products and processes, when we are confronted with a customer engineering challenge, we can conceptualize a design concept that allows us to capitalize on the optimum combination of materials to solve a given problem. We have the ability to create our own prototype tools in-house so that we can go directly from concept to hardware and quickly present tangible product solutions for our customers to evaluate. Our ability to rapidly address customer challenges and provide prototype parts that include the use of new materials, products or processes is one of our key competitive strengths.
Operational Excellence.  We are dedicated to maintaining a culture of continuous improvement. We utilize lean manufacturing techniques and statistical methods to drive productivity and quality improvement. We use quality, delivery and speed-to-market as competitive advantages. Lean manufacturing not only improves overall costs and quality, it also improves product velocity through the manufacturing process. This leads to better response time and greater flexibility in scheduling. Our reputation for high quality, innovative products is attributable to a constant emphasis on engineering, including materials engineering, product and process engineering, and sales engineering, coupled with our dedication to lean manufacturing to ensure effective execution.
Depth of customer relationships.  We have developed long-term relationships with a customer base that we target deliberately. Each of our customers has substantial requirements for NVH management, water and air sealing, functional and decorative components. Due to our technical sophistication, raw material and adhesive innovation and rapid responsiveness, we have a reputation with our key customers as the supplier of choice for our core products within the North American automotive and appliance markets. Our sales engineers have developed deep relationships with the technical teams of our key customers. The customers’ engineers leverage our materials knowledge and utilize us as a resource to help them solve problems and/or pursue product enhancements. This enables us to become involved early in the design/development stage of new vehicles or appliances, leading to opportunities to introduce new products. In certain situations, we are able to influence the customer design specifications from which new business is awarded.
Key relationships with suppliers.  We have long relationships with over 150 raw material and adhesive suppliers. We track new developments in materials, and pursue exclusive relationships with those suppliers that develop innovative raw materials and adhesives. Our key suppliers see us as a way to introduce their new products and technology to the marketplace and obtain the necessary customer approvals. This, in turn, can lead to Unique being first to market with certain products or materials. For example, this has led to us having exclusive access for our types of products to the only source of recycled polyol for polyurethane in the industry. While products incorporating these materials accounted for less than 1% of net sales for the year ended December 30, 2018, we believe these recycled materials are opening up opportunities for new product variations that other competitors cannot offer. We constantly collaborate with our suppliers to develop new materials and adhesive combinations that exhibit a cost, quality and/or performance enhancement for our customers.
Proximity to key customers.  Our manufacturing facilities are strategically located to serve the North American automotive and appliance industries. Our primary manufacturing centers are in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. We believe that our manufacturing facilities are within approximately 500 miles of over 80.0% of North American vehicle production, and even closer to major appliance manufacturing locations. This is advantageous, because our products are light in weight, and transportation costs can be a significant portion of the delivered cost of products.
Our Strategy
Our business strategy is to be a valued partner in our customers’ product development and production processes by producing exceptional quality and providing reliable on-time delivery, competitive costs, and technical innovation with rapid engineering support. We utilize our extensive knowledge of raw materials and adhesives combined with our engineering development and rapid responsiveness to deliver innovative and timely customer solutions for NVH management, water and air sealing, decorative and other functional applications.
We attempt to align our internal human resources and technical capabilities to take advantage of industry mega trends, such as light weighting, telematics, and reduced energy consumption, which we believe have contributed to profitable revenue growth opportunities from our existing operations. In addition, our growth plan includes initiatives to develop certain new

TABLE OF CONTENTS

products and new markets which provide incremental growth opportunities. We believe that significant opportunities exist to continue to grow our business and increase profitability by focusing on the following:
Further Penetrate Existing Markets with Existing Products and Processes.  We believe we are positioned to gain share and grow in existing markets with our current products and processes, capitalizing on the industry’s increasing demand for NVH management content coupled with our capabilities, including exclusive proprietary materials sold to existing customers and targeted new customers. As OEM vehicles change materials to reduce weight, vehicles are utilizing more rubber and plastic components like those designed and supplied by Unique. In addition, the increasing use of telematics is driving a need for quieter interiors in vehicles at all levels. This is causing an increase in the amount of acoustical insulation and solutions per vehicle. Separately, the rate of increase in vehicle production is projected to be significantly higher in the Southern United States and Mexico than elsewhere in North America over the next few years. We hope to capitalize on our ability to service customers in different geographical locations through our manufacturing facilities in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States and in Mexico and Canada.
Develop New Products and Processes for Existing Markets.  We have developed and earned the reputation as a problem solver to our current customers. As a result, we are in the position to develop complementary products and processes that can be sold to the same purchasing and engineering groups that already do business with us. By adding products and processes to our portfolio that broaden our scope with existing engineers and purchasing groups, we can offer one stop shopping, that allows them to reduce their supply base and complexity, while increasing sales opportunities for Unique. We work closely with raw material and adhesive suppliers to develop innovative solutions that offer cost and performance improvement. We constantly focus on finding new applications for molded products utilizing thermoforming, compression and fusion molding. These activities frequently lead to the development of new or novel products not yet in common use. When this occurs, we actively explore the patentability of the product. Protection of our intellectual property is a conscious part of our strategy of using technology and innovation as a competitive advantage. An example of this is our patent pending for light weight TwinShape duct technology.
Create New Markets with Existing Products and Processes.  While the specific products may vary, we have identified numerous opportunities to sell products fabricated using die cut and molding technology into new markets such as medical and industrial markets that we do not currently serve. We have demonstrated the ability to develop cost effective products utilizing various materials. Our recent acquisitions have provided the Company with credible access to a variety of new markets for our products. Because of our strategic acquisitions, we are currently developing new products for the appliance, water heater and HVAC industries utilizing our various molding technologies. We are also exploring increased opportunities for medical products. Raw material and adhesive suppliers rely on us to provide marketplace insight into new or emerging customer challenges. We have the capability to combine new materials with new processes to create cost effective products in new markets.
Pursue Acquisitions.  We expect to selectively pursue acquisitions that add new products and/or processes or geographic and market expansion to further expand our portfolio of customer solutions. Since December 2013, management has completed four accretive add-on acquisitions that added new markets, products, and additional manufacturing processes to our capabilities. Management has a long history of identifying and successfully integrating new platforms. We will continue to use our relationship with Taglich Private Equity, LLC, which sponsored our formation, to identify evaluate and execute acquisition opportunities.
