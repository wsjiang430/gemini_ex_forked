Item 1. Business
General
 
We are a New York-based real estate finance company that specializes in originating, servicing and managing a portfolio of first mortgage loans. We offer short-term, secured, non-banking loans (sometimes referred to as “hard money” loans), which we may renew or extend on, before or after their initial term expires, to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation or improvement of properties located around the New York metropolitan area. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). We have qualified for taxation as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014.
 
We are organized as a New York corporation and operated as a fully-taxable C-corporation for federal and state income tax purposes through the end of our 2013 tax year. As a result, we were able to re-invest most of our net after-tax profits back into our business. In 2014, we concluded that it would be in the best interests of our shareholders if we operated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In July 2014, we completed a public offering of 1,754,386 common shares to the public. As a result of that offering, we met all the requirements to qualify as a REIT and elected REIT status starting with that year.
 
In order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our shareholders each year. To the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders (but more than 90%) we will maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, but the undistributed portion will be subject to regular corporate income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to federal excise taxes and minimum state taxes. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). In addition, in order for us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding common shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year. To help ensure that we meet the tests, our restated certificate of incorporation restricts the acquisition and ownership of our capital stock. The ownership limitation is fixed at 4.0% of our outstanding shares of capital stock, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive.
 
The properties securing the loans are generally classified as residential or commercial real estate and, typically, are not income producing. Each loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate. In addition, each loan is personally guaranteed by the principal(s) of the borrower, which guarantee may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower. The face amount of the loans we originated in the past seven years ranged from $30,000 to a maximum of $2.5 million. Our lending policy limits the maximum amount of any loan to the lower of (i) 9.9% of the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio (not including the loan under consideration) and (ii) $2.5 million. Our loans typically have a maximum initial term of 12 months and bear interest at a fixed rate of 10% to 14% per year. In addition, we usually receive origination fees or “points” ranging from 0% to 2% of the original principal amount of the loan as well as other fees relating to underwriting and funding the loan. Interest is always payable monthly, in arrears. In the case of acquisition financing, the principal amount of the loan usually does not exceed 75% of the value of the property (as determined by an independent appraiser) and in the case of construction financing, it is typically up to 80% of construction costs.

Since commencing our business in 2007, we have never foreclosed on a property and none of our loans have ever gone into default, although sometimes we have renewed or extended the term of a loan to enable the borrower to avoid premature sale or refinancing of the property. When we renew or extend a loan we generally receive additional “points” and other fees.
 
Our executive officers are experienced in hard money lending under various economic and market conditions. Loans are originated, underwritten and structured by our Chief Executive Officer, assisted by our Chief Financial Officer, and then managed and serviced principally by our Chief Financial Officer and our internal team. A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new business. We also receive leads for new business from real estate brokers and mortgage brokers and a limited amount of advertising.
 
Our primary business objective is to grow our loan portfolio while protecting and preserving capital in a manner that provides for attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to selectively originate, fund loans secured by first mortgages on residential real estate held for investment located around the New York metropolitan area and to carefully manage and service our portfolio in a manner designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe that current market dynamics specifically the demand/supply imbalance for relatively small real estate loans, presents significant opportunities for us to selectively originate high-quality first mortgage loans on attractive terms and we believe that these market conditions should persist for a number of years. We have built our business on a foundation of intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market combined with a disciplined credit and due diligence culture that is designed to protect and preserve capital. We believe that our flexibility and ability to structure loans that address the needs of our borrowers without compromising our standards on credit risk, our expertise, our intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans, has defined our success until now and should enable us to continue to achieve our objectives.
 
The Market Opportunity
 
Real estate investment is a capital-intensive business that relies heavily on debt capital to acquire, develop, improve, construct, renovate and maintain properties. We believe that the demand for relatively small loans to acquire, renovate or improve residential real estate held around the New York metropolitan market presents a compelling opportunity to generate attractive returns for an established, well-financed, non-bank lender like us. We have competed successfully in this market notwithstanding the fact that many traditional lenders, such as banks and other institutional lenders, also service this market. Our primary competitive advantage is our ability to approve and fund loans quickly and efficiently. In this environment, characterized by a supply-demand imbalance for financing and increasing asset values, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize and profit from these industry trends.

We believe there is a significant market opportunity for a well-capitalized “hard money” real estate finance company to originate attractively priced loans with strong credit fundamentals. Particularly around the New York metropolitan area, where real estate values are relatively stable and substandard properties are being improved, rehabilitated and renovated, we believe there are many opportunities for a “hard money” lender providing capital for these purposes to small scale developers. We further believe that our flexibility to structure loans to suit the particular needs of our borrowers and our ability to close quickly make us an attractive alternative to banks and other large institutional lenders for small real estate developers and investors.
 
Our Business and Growth Strategies
 
Our objective is to protect and preserve capital in a manner that provides for attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term, principally through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to focus exclusively on selectively originating, servicing and managing a portfolio of short-term real estate loans secured by first mortgages on real estate located around the New York metropolitan area that are designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe that our ability to react quickly to the needs of borrowers, our flexibility in terms of structuring loans to meet the needs of borrowers, our intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market, our expertise in “hard money” lending and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans, should enable us to achieve this objective. Nevertheless, we will remain flexible in order to take advantage of other real estate related opportunities that may arise from time to time, whether they relate to the mortgage market or, if we determine that it is in our best interest, to make direct or indirect investments in real estate.
 
Our strategy to achieve our objective includes the following:
 

● | capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market and the continuing demand for liquidity in the real estate market; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | take advantage of the prevailing economic environment as well as economic, political and social trends that may impact real estate lending currently and in the future as well as the outlook for real estate in general and particular asset classes; 
● | remain flexible in order to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle; and 
● | operate so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT and for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. 

 
In furtherance of these strategies, we have a credit line agreement with Webster Business Credit Corporation (“Webster”) and Flushing Bank (“Flushing”), whereby Webster and Flushing have extended us a $25 million credit line.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths include:
 

● | Experienced management team. Our management team has successfully originated and serviced a portfolio of real estate mortgage loans generating attractive annual returns under varying economic and real estate market conditions. We expect that the experience of our management team will provide us with the ability to effectively deploy our capital in a manner that we believe will provide for attractive risk-adjusted returns but with a focus on capital preservation and protection.

● | Long-standing relationships. A significant portion of our business comes from repeat customers with whom we have long-standing relationships. These customers are also a referral source for new borrowers. As long as these customers remain active real estate investors they provide us with an advantage in securing new business and help us maintain a pipeline to attractive new opportunities that may not be available to many of our competitors or to the general market. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Knowledge of the market. Our intimate knowledge of the New York metropolitan area real estate market enhances our ability to identify attractive opportunities and helps distinguish us from many of our competitors. 
● | Disciplined lending. We seek to maximize our risk-adjusted returns, and preserve and protect capital, through our disciplined and credit-based approach. We utilize rigorous underwriting and loan closing procedures that include numerous checks and balances to evaluate the risks and merits of each potential transaction. We seek to protect and preserve capital by carefully evaluating the condition of the property, the location of the property, and the creditworthiness of the guarantors. 
● | Vertically-integrated loan origination platform. We manage and control the loan process from origination through closing with our own personnel and independent legal counsel and appraisers, with whom we have long relationships, who together constitute a highly experienced team in credit evaluation, underwriting and loan structuring. We also believe that our procedures and experience allow us to quickly and efficiently execute opportunities we deem desirable. 
● | Structuring flexibility. As a relatively small, non-bank real estate lender, we can move quickly and have much more flexibility than traditional lenders to structure loans to suit the needs of our clients. Our ability to customize financing structures to meet borrowers’ needs is one of our key business strengths. 
● | No legacy issues. Unlike many of our competitors, we are not burdened by distressed legacy real estate assets. We do not have a legacy portfolio of lower-return or problem loans that could potentially dilute the attractive returns we believe are available in the current liquidity-challenged environment and/or distract and monopolize our management team’s time and attention. We do not have any adverse credit exposure to, and we do not anticipate that our performance will be negatively impacted by, previously purchased assets. 

Our Real Estate Lending Activities
 
Our real estate lending activities involve originating, funding, servicing and managing short-term loans (i.e.: loans with an initial term of not more than one year), secured by first mortgage liens on real estate property around the New York metropolitan area held for investment or resale. Generally, borrowers use the proceeds from our loans for one of three purposes: (i) to acquire and renovate existing residential (single, one or two family) real estate properties; (ii) to acquire vacant real estate and construct residential real properties; and (iii) to purchase and hold income producing properties. Our mortgage loans are structured to fit the needs and business plans of the borrowers. Revenue is generated primarily from the interest borrowers pay on our loans and, to a lesser extent, loan fee income generated on the origination and extension of loans.

Most of our loans are funded in full at the closing. However, our loan portfolio includes a number of construction loans, which are only partially funded at closing. At December 31, 2017, our unfunded commitment was approximately $5.28 million. At December 31, 2018, our unfunded commitment was approximately $7.27 million. Advances under construction loans are funded against requests supported by all required documentation as and when needed to pay contractors and other costs of construction. In the case of construction loans, the borrower will either deliver multiple notes or one global note for the entire commitment. In either case, interest only accrues on the funded portion of the loan.
 
In general, our strategy is to service and manage the loans we originate until they are paid. However, there have been a few instances where we have either used loans as collateral, or sold participating interests in loans. At December 31, 2018, all of our loans are secured by properties located around the New York metropolitan area, which is where we are based. Most of the properties we finance are residential, although on occasion they are classified as commercial. However, in all instances the properties are held only for investment by the borrowers. Most of these properties do not generate any cash flow.
 
The typical terms of our loans are as follows:
 
Principal amount – In the last seven years, a minimum of $30,000 to a maximum of $2.5 million. Our lending policy limits the maximum loan amount to the lower of (i) 9.9% of the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio (not including the loan under consideration) and (ii) $2.5 million.
 
Loan-to-Value Ratio - Up to 75%, and/or up to 80% of construction costs.
 
Interest rate - Most of the loans in our portfolio have a fixed rate of typically 10% to 14%.
 
Term - Generally, one year with early termination in the event of a sale of the property or a refinancing. We entertain requests for granting extensions under certain conditions.
 
Prepayments - Borrower may prepay the loan at any time beginning three months after the funding date.
 
Covenants - To timely pay all interest on the loan and to maintain hazard insurance with respect to the property.
 
Events of default - Include: (i) failure to comply with the loan terms; (ii) breach of a covenant.
 
Payment terms - Interest only is payable monthly in arrears. Principal is due in a “balloon” payment at the maturity date.
 
Escrow - None.
 
Reserves - None.
 
Security - The loan is evidenced by a promissory note, which is secured by a first mortgage lien on the real property owned by the borrower. In addition, each loan is guaranteed by the principals of the borrower, which may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower.

Fees and Expenses - Borrowers generally pay an origination fee equal to 0% to 2% of the loan amount. If we agree to extend the term of the loan, we usually collect the same origination fee we charged on the initial funding of the loan. In addition, borrowers also pay a processing fee, wire fee, bounced check fee and, in the case of construction loans, check requisition fee for each draw from the loan. Finally, the borrower pays all expenses relating to obtaining the loan including the cost of a property appraisal, the cost of a credit report and all title, recording fees and legal fees.
 
Operating Data 
 
Our lending activities increased each year since 2007, the first year we started making real estate loans. We believe our business will continue to grow given the strength of the New York real estate market and our reputation among real estate investors as a reliable and reasonable financing source.

Our Origination Process and Underwriting Criteria
 
We primarily rely on our relationships with existing and former borrowers, real estate investors, real estate brokers, loan initiators, and mortgage brokers to originate loans. Many of our borrowers are “repeat customers.” When underwriting a loan, the primary focus of our analysis is the value of a property and the credit worthiness of the borrower and its principals. Prior to making a final decision on a loan application we conduct extensive due diligence of the borrower and its principals. In terms of the property, we require an assessment report and evaluation. We also order title, lien and judgment searches. In most cases, we will also make an on-site visit to evaluate not only the property but the neighborhood in which it is located. Finally, we analyze and assess financial and operational data provided by the borrower relating to its operation and maintenance of the property. In terms of the borrower and its principals, we usually obtain third party credit reports from one of the major credit reporting services as well as personal financial information provided by the borrower and its principals. We analyze all this information carefully prior to making a final determination. Ultimately, our decision is based on our conclusions regarding the value of the property, which takes into account factors such as the neighborhood in which the property is located, the current use and potential alternative use of the property, current and potential net income from the property, the local market, sales information of comparable properties, existing zoning regulations, the creditworthiness of the borrower and its principals and their experience in real estate ownership, construction, development and management. In conducting our due diligence we rely, in part, on third party professionals and experts including appraisers, engineers, title insurers and attorneys.
 
Before a loan commitment is issued, the loan must be reviewed and approved by our Chief Executive Officer. Our loan commitments are generally issued subject to receipt by us of title documentation and title report, in a form satisfactory to us, for the underlying property. We require a personal guarantee from the principal or principals of the borrower.
 
Our Current Financing Strategies
 
Our financing strategies are critical to the success and growth of our business. Our financing strategies at this time are limited to equity and debt offerings. Our principal capital raising transactions have consisted of the following:
 
Credit line. Currently, we have a credit line with Webster and Flushing pursuant to which we are eligible to borrow up to $25 million against assignments of mortgages and other collateral (the “Webster Credit Line”), as described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. The current interest rates under the Webster Credit Line equal (i) LIBOR plus a premium, which rate aggregated 6.52% as of December 31, 2018, or (ii) a Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus 2.25% plus a 0.5% agency fee, as chosen by the Company for each drawdown. (See Note 6 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.)

Recent Public offerings.
 
On April 25, 2016, MBC Funding II, our wholly owned subsidiary, completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering of 6% senior secured notes due April 22, 2026 (the “Notes”), which are currently outstanding. We guarantee MBC Funding II’s obligations under the Notes, which are secured by our pledge of 100% of the outstanding common shares of MBC Funding II we own. On August 15, 2016, we completed a public offering of 672,269 common shares. In addition, the underwriter fully exercised its over-allotment option for an additional 100,840 common shares. The gross proceeds from the offering, including the exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.6 million and the net proceeds were approximately $4.2 million, after deducting our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
 
On July 24, 2018, we completed a public offering of 1,428,572 common shares. On August 1, 2018, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option for an additional 117,214 common shares. The gross proceeds from the offering, including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $10.8 million and the net proceeds were approximately $9.9 million, after deducting our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
 
The following table shows our sources of capital, including our financing arrangements, and our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018:

Competition
 
The real estate finance market around the New York metropolitan area is highly competitive. We face competition for lending and investment opportunities from a variety of institutional lenders and investors and many other market participants, including specialty finance companies, mortgage/other REITs, commercial banks and thrift institutions, investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other financial institutions as well as private equity funds, family offices and high net worth individuals. Many of these competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, established lending relationships with customers, financial resources, and access to capital.
 
Notwithstanding the intense competition and some of our competitive disadvantages, we believe we have carved a niche for ourselves among small real estate developers, owners and contractors throughout the New York metropolitan area because of our ability to structure each loan to suit the needs of each individual borrower and our ability to act quickly. In addition, we believe we have developed a reputation among these borrowers as offering reasonable terms and providing outstanding customer service. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to maintain and capitalize on our existing relationships with borrowers and brokers and to expand our borrower base by continuing to offer attractive loan products, remain competitive in pricing and terms, and provide superior service.

Sales and Marketing
 
We do not engage any third parties for sales and marketing. Rather, we rely on our internal team to generate lending opportunities as well as referrals from existing or former borrowers, brokers and bankers and advertising to generate lending opportunities. A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new leads.
Intellectual Property
 
Our business does not depend on exploiting or leveraging any intellectual property rights. To the extent we own any rights to intellectual property, we rely on a combination of federal, state and common law trademarks, service marks and trade names, copyrights and trade secret protection. We have registered some of our trademarks and service marks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office including “Manhattan Bridge Capital”.
 
The protective steps we have taken may not deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. These claims, if meritorious, could require us to license other rights or subject us to damages and, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed four employees. In addition, during 2018 we used outside lawyers and other independent professionals to verify titles and ownership, to file liens and to consummate the transactions. Outside appraisers were used to assist management in evaluating the worth of collateral, when deemed necessary by management. We also used construction inspectors as well as mortgage brokers and deal initiators.
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, we may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and ERISA. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third-parties who we do not control.
Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities
 
Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We also are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, The USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and federal and state securities laws and regulations.

Investment Company Act Exemption
 
Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, we are not currently required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, we cannot assure you that our business strategy will not evolve over time in a manner that could subject us to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act.
 
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test.
 
We rely on the exception set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act which excludes from the definition of investment company “[a]ny person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses... (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” This exception generally requires that at least 55% of an entity’s assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as “qualifying interests,” and at least another 25% of the entity’s assets must be comprised of real estate-type interests reduced by any amount of qualifying interests that the entity holds in excess of the 55% minimum limit (with no more than 20% of the entity’s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). At the present time, we qualify for the exception under this section and our current intention is to continue to focus on originating short term loans secured by first mortgages on real property. However, if, in the future, we do acquire non-real estate assets without the acquisition of substantial real estate assets, we may be deemed to be an “investment company” and be required to register as such under the Investment Company Act, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters.
 
Qualification for exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act will limit our ability to make certain investments. In addition, complying with the tests for such exclusion could restrict the time at which we can acquire and sell assets.
 
Environmental Laws
 
Our borrowers, who own properties, may be subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our debt instruments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. To date, our borrowers’ compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our earnings and we do not have reason to believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on the properties owned by our borrowers.
