ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 
InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc. (“InnerScope” or the “Company”) is a Nevada Corporation incorporated June 15, 2012, with its principal place of business in Roseville, California.

On June 20, 2012, InnerScope acquired InnerScope Advertising Agency, LLC (“ILLC”), a commonly owned entity, to provide advertising/marketing services to the hearing device industry in accordance with an Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with ILLC.
 
On November 1, 2013, InnerScope acquired Intela-Hear, LLC (“Intela-Hear”), a commonly owned entity, with an Acquisition and Plan of Share Exchange with Intela-Hear.
 
On August 25, 2017, the Company changed its name to InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the Company’s current direction as a technology driven company with a scalable business to business (B2B) solution and business to consumer (and B2C) solution. Recently, the Company began offering its own line of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) registered Hearing Aids and its “Hearable”, and “Wearable” Personal Sound Amplifier Products (PSAPs). On July 5, 2018, the Company signed a supplier agreement as a direct shipped vendor ("DSV") for Walmart.com. The Company has been accepted as a Walmart.com USA, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.) supplier and will sell its FDA-Registered Hearing Aids and its PSAP to Walmart.com as the retailer for their Direct-To-Consumer online retail sale.
 
InnerScope is a technology driven company with scalable Business to Business (“BTB”) and Business to Consumer (“BTC”) solutions. The Company offers a BTB SaaS based Patient Management System (PMS) software program, designed to improve operations and communication with patients. InnerScope also offers a Buying Group experience for audiology practice, enabling owners to lower product costs and increase their margins. The Company will compete in the DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) markets with its own line of “Hearables”, and “Wearables”, including APPs on the iOS and Android markets. The company also has opened 5 retail hearing device clinics and plans on using management’s unique and successful talents on acquiring and opening additional audiological brick and mortar clinics to be owned and operated by the company. 
 
On September 10, 2018, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Kathy L Amos Audiology (“Amos Audiology”) in exchange for 340,352 shares of common stock (the “Acquisition”). Amos Audiology provides retail hearing aid sales and audiological services in the East Bay area of San Francisco.
 
We are dedicated to serving the retail hearing aid dispensing community and developing a program to contribute to various hearing aid focused charities.
 
InnerScope is an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.
 
InnerScope will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”).

InnerScope also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.

The Expansion Agreement was cancelled on January 6, 2017. The Client has decided to do their own marketing in-house and eliminate this out-sourced contract and decided to open only one location and delay the opening of any other new stores.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized $100,000 of income for the one new store, opened in January 2017, and $160,000 in other income, net, for payments received for the Expansion Agreement pursuant to the cancellation.

Revenue Generation
 
The Company has begun to implement an industry encompassing revenue strategy, including the current revenue model to other major sectors of the global hearing industry. The Company plans include generating revenues from 7 separate revenue streams. Each stream will generate revenue and be poised for growth, increasing the Company’s market penetration.
 
The 7 revenue streams are:
 
Patient Management System (PMS): a SaaS based software program which was created, designed and customized by and for audiologists, specifically to fill a much-needed clinical gap solved in other multidiscipline software programs. It allows audiological retail clinics to better manage their day-to-day operations through efficient clinical workflow, patient follow up, and logical organization of data. The PMS software platform delivers a comprehensive business solution. Once the data is uploaded, the platform seamlessly integrates the needs of the audiologist, management, patient and marketing. The software also provides a link between an electronic medical record (EMR) system containing patient's medical history, all while seamlessly integrating the schedule and patient files of the clinics’ patient management platform. EMR systems are not designed for Audiology and the records are often not integrated. The Company’s PMS software solves that problem by linking the two platforms.
 
Buying Group: The Company will create an exclusive Buying Group experience that management believes will permit hearing aid practices of all sizes to reduce their wholesale costs by aggregating their orders with other practices to obtain a lower per unit cost.
 
Direct-to-Consumer (DTC): The Company has begun the marketing and selling of products within the new emerging “Hearables” and “Wearables” markets in “Personal Sound Amplification Products” (PSAP’s) and the Over-the-Counter (OTC) hearing aid market created by the result of recently passed Congressional legislation, known as “The Hearing Aid Act of 2017”, which allows the purchase of hearing aids and related products without seeking a medical professional. The Company will continue to market and sell these products as well as invest in “Hearable” technology and has and will continue to create its own brands and technology in the PSAP and OTC hearing aids in the DTC markets. 
 
APP Development: The Company plans on building apps for the iOS and Android markets that will be dedicated to serving the hearing impairment population around the world. The APPs will be developed to help the audiology and hearing aid retail practices that have joined the Buying Group or using the Company’s PMS software, as well as APPs for the hearing-impaired consumer to use for a better hearing experience.
 
Advertising and Marketing: This division will be built on the Company’s current business and will include graphic artists, digital and print marketing experts, and telemarketers. This division will assist all divisions in helping to market and deploy all products and services to practices and consumers, as well as assisting Buying Group members with advertising and marketing for their own practices. Whether the hearing aid dispensary is small, medium or large, we have previously shown an ability to increase the total revenue of our clients without increasing cost. There are over 14,000 retail hearing aid dispensing practices in the United States. The company operates in a highly competitive and growing industry. The proliferation of media channels, including the rapid development of interactive technologies and mediums, along with their integration within all offerings has fragmented consumer audiences, especially the 55+ age sector which is our clients’ primary targeted audience. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a cost-effective way, causing them to turn to marketing service providers for a customized mix of advertising and marketing communications services designed to make the best use of their total marketing expenditures. We provide a comprehensive range of services (including consulting services), grouped into four fundamental disciplines: advertising/marketing, customer relationship management, public relations and specialty communications.
 
Retail: The Company plans to open a chain of Audiological and Hearing Aid Clinics throughout the United States and eventually abroad.
 
Research and Development (“R&D”): Management has been researching and developing products and solutions for the Business to Business (“BTB”) and Business to Consumer (“BTC”) hearing impaired markets for more than 3 decades. The R&D team which will be comprised of world renowned scientists, business professionals and industry leaders, will develop and deploy products.

Competition
 
We have numerous direct, indirect and partial competitors, many of which have valuable industry relationships and access to greater resources than we do. There is no assurance that we will be able to provide services that will be competitive in the marketplace, and even if competitive, that we will be able to earn a profit.
 
The numerous types of direct or indirect competitors that exist in the market today include, but may not be limited to, sales and marketing firms, marketing consultants, design services, ad agencies, media buying firms, internet marketing firms, online social media firms and others: Key competitors include Chicago Advertising & Marketing (CAM), a leader in direct marketing for the Hearing Aid Industry since 1995, Beeman Marketing, a marketing firm specializing in hearing care practitioners and audiologists since 2004, and Nutshell Marketing, a high quality direct response marketing firm specialized in targeting 55 and older age group.
 
The internet is fast becoming a major factor in the distribution of hearing aids in the U.S. Numerous small companies are on the internet advertising hearing aids for the cheapest price, and the largest hearing aid manufacturer, Sonova, which owns HearingPlanet, is most prominent among these online offerings. However, internet sales still require the participation of a local practitioner for testing and fitting. This limits the widespread geographic appeal of internet sales.
 
Our Buying Group plan faces competition from major retail distributors and/or networks, as there is presently rapid growth of manufacturer-owned retail stores. Major consolidation has taken place in the US market by the hearing aid manufacturers in the last few years, with almost every manufacturer participating in buying out other smaller manufacturers, resulting in many different brand labels controlled under the same parent company umbrella. This consolidation has allowed the manufacturers to increase and control more of their distribution by offering different levels in their product lines throughout their different brands. This has also allowed the manufacturers to implement different price strategies for the same technology throughout their brands. This consolidation has not only increased their market share but also increased their profit margins.
 
Technology and Development
 
We are equipped with three (3) G5 MacPros and one (1) iMac, which are up-to-date with the latest in software package from Adobe Creative Cloud and other graphic design software. We also utilize a large format printer and a production color printer to handle all proofing needs. All design and client information is held on a cloud computing network, which allows all designers and customer relation associates to access all design and customer files from on-site and off-site, to improve productivity and decrease lag time. Files are encrypted and password protected to make sure files are securely stored.
Intellectual Property
 
We have copyrights on all materials that are created or modified by any designers, which includes all conceptual and final artwork. Over the years, we have developed proprietary processes in how we manage our marketing programs; these processes are not protected by any patents but, to the extent possible, are covered by non-disclosure agreements executed with clients, consultants and employees. In the future we may utilize the services of contract developers, consultants, and/or third party personnel. Our success may depend in part upon our ability to preserve our trade secrets, obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies, products and processes, and operate without infringing upon the proprietary right of other parties. However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies, trade secrets, and know-how that are not patentable. Although we may take action to protect our unpatented trade secrets and our proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors, we cannot guarantee that:

(a) | these agreements will not be breached;
----+---------------------------------------


(b) | we would have adequate remedies for any breach; or 
----+-------------------------------------------------------


(c) | our proprietary trade secrets and know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed or discovered by competitors. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We cannot guarantee that our actions will be sufficient to prevent imitation or duplication of either our products or services by others or prevent others from claiming violations of their trade secrets and proprietary rights.

Government Regulation.
 
We are subject to a limited variety of local, state, and federal regulations. Some of our products for example are registered with the FDA. While we believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable regulations, there can be no assurances that from time to time unintentional violations of such regulations will not occur. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulation applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. Our current business requires that we comply with state corporate filings, city or county business license and the necessary business liability insurance. The requirements of these regulations are minimal and do not cause any undue burden.
 
Internet access and online services are not subject to direct regulation in the United States. Changes in the laws and regulations relating to the telecommunications and media industry, however, could impact our business. For example, the Federal Communications Commission could begin to regulate the Internet and online service industry, which could result in increased costs for us. The laws and regulations applicable to the Internet and to our services are evolving and unclear and could damage our business. There are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to, or commerce on, the Internet. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted, covering issues such as user privacy, defamation, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Such legislation could expose us to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the Internet, decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium, or require us to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations.
 
Debt and Recent Events
 
Capital Raising
 
During the year ended 2018 and through April 15, 2019, we incurred an aggregate of $1,961,133 and $1,296,003 of convertible indebtedness, respectively, at variable conversion rates.
