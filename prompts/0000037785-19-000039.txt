ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in two distinct business segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions and FMC Lithium. Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as in non-agricultural markets for pest control. Our FMC Lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products, which are used primarily in energy storage, specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application.
FMC Lithium (Livent Corporation)
In March 2017, we announced our intention to separate our FMC Lithium segment (subsequently renamed Livent Corporation, or "Livent") into a publicly traded company. The initial step of the separation, the initial public offering ("IPO") of Livent, closed on October 15, 2018. In connection with the IPO, Livent had granted the underwriters an option to purchase additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments at the IPO price, less the underwriting discount. On November 8, 2018, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase additional shares. After completion of the IPO and the underwriters' exercise to purchase additional shares of common stock, FMC owned 123 million shares of Livent's common stock, representing approximately 84 percent of the total outstanding shares of Livent's common stock. FMC presently intends to distribute the remaining Livent shares to FMC stockholders (the "Distribution") on March 1, 2019. We will continue to consolidate and present Livent as the FMC Lithium segment until the full separation date. At that time, results of FMC Lithium will be presented as a discontinued operation.
DuPont Crop Protection Business
On March 31, 2017, we entered into a definitive Transaction Agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont"). On November 1, 2017, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement, we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to DuPont's Crop Protection business and research and development organization ("DuPont Crop Protection Business") (collectively, the "DuPont Crop Protection Business Acquisition"). In connection with this transaction, we sold to DuPont our FMC Health and Nutrition segment and paid DuPont $1.2 billion in cash. Our FMC Health and Nutrition business and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented throughout this document.
FMC Strategy
FMC has streamlined its portfolio over the past eight years to focus on technology-driven end markets with attractive long-term demand trends. The actions we have taken over the past year have better positioned each of our businesses to capitalize on future growth opportunities.
2018 was another pivotal year for FMC, as we made substantial progress toward integrating the recently acquired DuPont Crop Protection Business into FMC Agricultural Solutions and toward separating our Lithium business into a standalone public company, Livent Corporation. Our Agricultural Solutions segment grew revenue by 11 percent, on a pro forma basis, due to robust demand for our acquired insecticides, Rynaxypr® and Cyazypyr ® insect control, and broad cross-selling opportunities for all our products around the world. Rynaxypr® is now the second largest active ingredient in the crop protection market. We also launched 30 new formulated products in 2018, which is key to life cycle management of our products. We far outperformed the crop protection market, which we estimate grew by just 2 to 3 percent in 2018. FMC will begin launching its technology pipeline of six new active ingredients, starting with our bixafen fungicide launch - under the Lucento brand - in North America in the first quarter of 2019.
The November 2017 acquisition of a significant portion of the DuPont Crop Protection Business transformed FMC into a tier-one leader and the fifth largest global provider in the agricultural chemicals market. The acquisition included DuPont’s industry-leading insecticides and herbicides (the majority of which are patented technologies), exceptional discovery research capabilities and a global manufacturing network. The acquisition also added 16 discovery leads to our pipeline, and we expect to spend approximately 
4

7 percent of FMC Agricultural Solutions sales on research and development annually. FMC acquired 14 manufacturing plants from DuPont, and with 26 total plants today, we have the scale to operate this business with greater resources and global reach to address changing market conditions.
Livent Corporation, which is approximately 84 percent owned by FMC, is one of the leading global producers of specialty lithium products, and 2018 was another year of significant growth for the company's lithium products. As an independent company, Livent will have a focused investor base and strong balance sheet, ensuring it has the financial capacity to pursue its growth plans and be a leading force in this critical industry. We made several strategic decisions during the last few years to focus FMC Lithium on downstream, higher-value products. We convert most of our lithium carbonate and chloride production into high-purity materials, including lithium hydroxide used in electric vehicle ("EV") batteries, and butyllithium and lithium metals for specialty applications. In 2018, we had a full year of sales from our lithium hydroxide plant that we opened in China in the second half of 2017. That plant can produce 10,000 metric tons per year, in addition to the 10,000 metric tons of annual production capacity at our Bessemer City, NC plant, to meet accelerating demand for FMC’s hydroxide products.
We maintain our commitment to enterprise sustainability, including responsible stewardship. As we grow, we will do so in a responsible way. Safety and business ethics will remain of utmost importance. Meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus.

FMC Agricultural Solutions


Overview

Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment, which represents approximately 91 percent of our 2018 consolidated revenues, operates in the agrochemicals industry. This segment develops, manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection, professional pest control and lawn and garden products. 
Products and Markets
FMC Agricultural Solutions' portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. The majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides, and we have a small but fast-growing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments. Our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests, while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficult-to-control weeds. We are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products, seed treatments and micro-nutrients.
In the Latin American region, which includes the large agricultural market of Brazil, we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization, and we access the market through independent distributors and co-ops. In North America, 
6

we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in Canada. We access the European markets through our own sales and marketing organizations. With the 2017 acquisition of the DuPont Crop Protection Business, we now access key Asian markets through large distributors, in addition to either local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations. Through these and other alliances, along with our own targeted marketing efforts, access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives, we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and non-crop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively.
Industry Overview 
The three principal categories of agricultural and non-crop chemicals are: herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, representing approximately 43 percent, 25 percent and 29 percent of global industry revenue, respectively.
The agrochemicals industry is more consolidated following several recent mergers of the leading crop protection companies, which now include FMC, ChemChina (owners of Syngenta and Adama), Bayer AG (acquired Monsanto in 2018), BASF AG and DowDuPont (Corteva Agriscience, the agricultural division of DowDuPont, is expected to be spun out in June 2019). These five companies currently represent approximately 74 percent of the crop protection industry’s global sales. The next tier of agrochemical producers include Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd., Nufarm Ltd. and United Phosphorous Ltd. (UPL also acquired Arysta on February 1, 2019). FMC employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops, markets and geographies, while also being supported by a low-cost manufacturing model.
Growth
The 2017 acquisition of a significant portion of the DuPont Crop Protection Business positions FMC among leading agrochemical producers in the world. The acquired insecticides are predominantly based on patent-protected active ingredients and are growing well above market patterns. Our complementary technologies combine improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline, resulting in new and differentiated products. We will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver near-term growth.
We will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring, accessing, developing, marketing, distributing and/or selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers.
Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide cost-effective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles. Our external growth efforts include product acquisitions, in-licensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access, complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces. We have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize.

Overview

    
Our FMC Lithium segment represents 9 percent of our 2018 consolidated revenues.
FMC Lithium is a pure-play, fully integrated lithium company, with a long, proven history of producing performance lithium compounds. Our primary products, namely battery-grade lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal are critical inputs used in various performance applications. Our strategy is to focus on supplying high performance lithium compounds to the fast growing EV battery market, while continuing to maintain our position as a leading global producer of butyllithium and high purity lithium metal. With extensive global capabilities, over 60 years of continuous production experience, applications and technical expertise and deep customer relationships, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the accelerating trend of vehicle electrification.
FMC Lithium produces lithium compounds for use in applications that have specific performance requirements, including battery-grade lithium hydroxide for use in high performance lithium-ion batteries. We believe the demand for our compounds will continue to grow as the electrification of transportation accelerates, and as the use of high nickel content cathode materials increases in the next generation of battery technology products. We also supply butyllithium, which is used as a synthesizer in the production of polymers and pharmaceutical products, as well as a range of specialty lithium compounds including high purity lithium metal, which is used in the production of lightweight materials for aerospace applications and non-rechargeable batteries. It is in these applications that we have established a differentiated position in the market through our ability to consistently produce and deliver performance lithium compounds.
Industry Overview
Lithium is a soft, naturally occurring, silvery-white metal that is widely used in a range of energy storage and industrial applications. Lithium is the lightest of all metals and has the highest specific heat capacity among all elements, a high charge density and low thermal expansion properties, enabling high-performance characteristics in end use applications that could not otherwise be achieved. These unique chemical and physical properties make it ideally suited for use in a variety of commercial applications.
Prior to 2000, lithium was primarily used in a wide range of industrial market applications, including air treatment, ceramics, glass, greases, metallurgy, non-rechargeable batteries, pharmaceuticals and polymers. 
Lithium’s use in energy storage applications accelerated in the 1990’s with the introduction of a commercially viable, rechargeable, lithium-ion battery. Lithium-ion battery technology provided a more efficient, longer-lasting and lighter alternative to incumbent battery technologies. The introduction and adoption of portable electronic devices over the past two decades fueled the initial growth in demand for lithium compounds in energy storage applications. In recent years, advancements in lithium-ion battery technology have resulted in increased adoption of lithium-ion batteries for use in powering EVs.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials used by FMC Agricultural Solutions, primarily processed chemicals, are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide. Our primary raw material used by FMC Lithium is lithium, which we extract through solar evaporation and a proprietary process from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines located in the Andes Mountains of Argentina.

Patents
We own and license a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business. The FMC intellectual property estate provides us with an important competitive advantage. Our patents cover many of our products, processes and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting the FMC new product pipeline. Patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities. We also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product end-users. Unlike patents, ownership rights in trademarks can be continued indefinitely so long as the trademarks are properly used and renewal fees are paid. We actively monitor and manage our patents and trademarks to maintain our rights in these assets. We believe that the invalidity or loss of any particular patent, trademark or license would be a remote possibility and/or would not likely have a material adverse effect on the overall business of FMC.
Seasonality
The seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the FMC Agricultural Solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations. FMC Agricultural Solutions' products sold in the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe and parts of Asia) serve seasonal agricultural markets from March through September, generally resulting in significant earnings in the first and second quarters, and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter. Markets in the southern hemisphere (Latin America and parts of the Asia Pacific region, including Australia) are served from July through February, generally resulting in earnings in the third, fourth and first quarters. The remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.
Competition
We encounter substantial competition in each of our two business segments. We market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners, independent distributors and sales representatives. The number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment. In general, we compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner.
Our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Industry products include crop protection chemicals and, for certain major competitors, genetically engineered (crop biotechnology) products. Competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents have expired in the last decade. In general, we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development, including novel formulations, proprietary mixes, and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing (mostly) proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus. We also differentiate ourselves by our global cost-competitiveness through our manufacturing strategies, establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions.
FMC Lithium sells its performance lithium compounds worldwide. Most markets for lithium compounds are global, with significant growth occurring in Asia, driven primarily by the development and manufacture of lithium-ion batteries. The market for lithium compounds also faces some barriers to entry, including access to an adequate and stable supply of lithium, technical expertise and development lead time. We compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner. We believe we are a leading provider of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in EV battery applications and of performance greases and benefit from low production costs and a history of efficient capital deployment. We also believe we are one of only a few global suppliers of butyllithium. Our primary competitor for performance lithium compounds is Albemarle Corporation. We are the only producer of high purity lithium metal in the Western Hemisphere and enjoy competitive advantages from our vertically integrated manufacturing approach and low production costs. Our primary competitors within the lithium metal product category include Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium and other Chinese producers.
Research and Development Expense
We perform research and development in both of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. The development efforts in the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions — both new active ingredients and new product formulations — that cost-effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
A discussion of environmental related factors can be found in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 11 “Environmental Obligations” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Employees
We employ approximately 7,300 people with about 1,900 people in our domestic operations and 5,400 people in our foreign operations. Approximately 800 of these employees are with Livent Corporation. 
Approximately 2 percent of our U.S.-based and 30 percent of our foreign-based employees, respectively, are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We have successfully concluded most of our recent contract negotiations without any material work stoppages. In those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred, there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of future contract negotiations. In 2019, eight foreign collective-bargaining agreements will be expiring. These contracts affect approximately 20 percent of our foreign-based employees. There will be no U.S. collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2019.
SEC Filings
SEC filings are available free of charge on our website, www.fmc.com. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are posted as soon as practicable after we furnish such materials to the SEC.
