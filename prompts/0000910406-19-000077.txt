Item 1.        Business                                            
Overview 
The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, along with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” and herein referred to as “Hain Celestial,” “we,” “us” and “our”), was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company’s mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, “better-for-you” products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide. 
The Company manufactures, markets, distributes and sells organic and natural products under brand names that are sold as “better-for-you” products, with many recognized brands in the various market categories it serves, including Almond Dream®, Arrowhead Mills®, Bearitos®, Better Bean®, BluePrint®, Casbah®, Celestial Seasonings®, Clarks™, Coconut Dream®, Cully & Sully®, Danival®, DeBoles®, Earth’s Best®, Ella’s Kitchen®, Europe’s Best®, Farmhouse Fare™, Frank Cooper’s®, Gale’s®, Garden of Eatin’®, GG UniqueFiber®, Hain Pure Foods®, Hartley’s®, Health Valley®, Imagine®, Johnson’s Juice Co.™, Joya®, Lima®, Linda McCartney® (under license), MaraNatha®, Mary Berry (under license), Natumi®, New Covent Garden Soup Co.®, Orchard House®, Rice Dream®, Robertson’s®, Rudi’s Gluten-Free Bakery™, Rudi’s Organic Bakery®, Sensible Portions®, Spectrum® Organics, Soy Dream®, Sun-Pat®, Sunripe®, SunSpire®, Terra®, The Greek Gods®, Walnut Acres®, Yorkshire Provender®, Yves Veggie Cuisine® and William’s™. The Company’s personal care products are marketed under the Alba Botanica®, Avalon Organics®, Earth’s Best®, JASON®, Live Clean® and Queen Helene® brands.
Historically, the Company divided its business into core platforms, which are defined by common consumer need, route-to-market or internal advantage and are aligned with the Company’s strategic roadmap to continue its leadership position in the organic and natural, “better-for-you” products industry. Those core platforms within our United States segment are:

• | Better-for-You Baby, which includes infant foods, infant and toddler formula, toddler and kids foods and diapers that nurture and care for babies and toddlers, under the Earth’s Best® and Ella’s Kitchen® brands.


• | Better-for-You Pantry, which includes core consumer staples, such as MaraNatha®, Arrowhead Mills®, Imagine® and Spectrum® brands.


• | Better-for-You Snacking, which includes wholesome products for in-between meals, such as Terra®, Sensible Portions® and Garden of Eatin’® brands.


• | Fresh Living, which includes yogurt, plant-based proteins and other refrigerated products, such as The Greek Gods® yogurt and Dream™ plant-based beverage brands.


• | Pure Personal Care, which includes personal care products focused on providing consumers with cleaner and gentler ingredients, such as JASON®, Live Clean®, Avalon Organics® and Alba Botanica® brands.


• | Tea, which includes tea products marketed under the Celestial Seasonings® brand.

Additionally, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Company launched Hain Ventures (formerly known as “Cultivate Ventures”), a venture unit with a twofold purpose: (i) to strategically invest in the Company’s smaller brands in high potential categories, by giving these brands a dedicated, creative focus for refresh and relaunch and (ii) to incubate and grow small acquisitions until they reach the scale required to migrate to the Company’s core platforms.
During fiscal 2019, the Company refined its strategy within the United States segment, focusing on simplifying the Company’s portfolio and reinvigorating profitable sales growth by discontinuing uneconomic investment, realigning resources to coincide with industrial brand role, reducing unproductive stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) and brands, and reassessing current pricing architecture. As part of this initiative, the Company reviewed its product portfolio and divided it into “Get Bigger” and “Get Better” brand categories.
The Company’s “Get Bigger” brands represent its strongest brands with higher margins, which compete in categories with strong growth. In order to capitalize on the potential of these brands, the Company began reallocating resources to optimize assortment and increase share of distribution. In addition, the Company will increase its marketing and innovation investments.
4

The Company’s “Get Better” brands are the brands in which the Company is primarily focused on simplification and expansion of profit. Some of these are low margin, non-strategic brands that add complexity with minimal benefit to the Company’s operations. Accordingly, in fiscal 2019, the Company initiated a SKU rationalization, which included the elimination of approximately 350 low velocity SKUs. The elimination of these SKUs is expected to impact sales growth in the next fiscal year, but is expected to result in expanded profits and a remaining set of core SKUs that will maintain their shelf space in the store. 
As part of the Company’s overall strategy, the Company may seek to dispose of businesses and brands that are less profitable or are otherwise less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio. Accordingly, the Company divested of all of its operations of the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment (discussed further below) and WestSoy® tofu, seitan and tempeh businesses in the United States. Additionally, on August 27, 2019, the Company sold the entities comprising its Tilda operating segment and certain other assets of the Tilda business. See Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
Productivity and Transformation
As part of the Company’s historical strategic review, it focused on a productivity initiative, which it called “Project Terra.” A key component of this project was the identification of global cost savings, and the removal of complexity from the business. This review has included and continues to include streamlining the Company’s manufacturing plants, co-packers and supply chain, eliminating served categories or brands within those categories, and product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating slow moving SKUs.
In fiscal 2019, the Company announced a new transformation initiative, of which one aspect is to identify additional areas of productivity savings to support sustainable profitable performance. 
Discontinued Operations
In March 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to sell all of the operations of the Hain Pure Protein Corporation (“HPPC”) operating segment, which includes the Plainville Farms and FreeBird businesses, and the EK Holdings, Inc. (“Empire Kosher” or “Empire”) operating segment, which were reported in the aggregate as the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment. These dispositions were undertaken to reduce complexity in the Company’s operations and simplify the Company’s brand portfolio, in addition to allowing additional flexibility to focus on opportunities for growth and innovation in the Company’s more profitable and faster growing core businesses.
Collectively, these dispositions represented a strategic shift that had a major impact on the Company’s operations and financial results and have been accounted for as discontinued operations. 
On February 15, 2019, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used primarily for the Plainville Farms business (a component of HPPC).
On June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the remainder of HPPC and EK Holdings, Inc. which includes the FreeBird and Empire Kosher businesses. 
See Note 5, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan 
On June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) succession plan, whereby the Company’s former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. On October 26, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Mark L. Schiller as President and CEO, succeeding Mr. Simon. In connection with the appointment, on October 26, 2018, the Company and Mr. Schiller entered into an employment agreement, which was approved by the Board, with Mr. Schiller’s employment commencing on November 5, 2018. Accordingly, Mr. Simon’s employment with the Company terminated on November 4, 2018. See Note 3, Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 
Headcount
As of June 30, 2019, we employed a total of 5,441 full-time employees.

Products
During fiscal 2019, we primarily sold our organic, natural, and “better-for-you” products in the following categories: grocery; snacks; personal care; and tea. We continuously evaluate our existing products for quality, taste, nutritional value and cost and make improvements where possible. We discontinue products or SKUs when sales of those items do not warrant further production. Our product categories consist of the following:
Grocery
Grocery products include infant formula, infant, toddler and kids foods, diapers and wipes, rice and grain-based products, plant-based beverages and frozen desserts (such as soy, rice, oat, almond and coconut), flour and baking mixes, breads, hot and cold cereals, pasta, condiments, cooking and culinary oils, granolas, cereal bars, canned, chilled fresh, aseptic and instant soups, yogurts, chilis, chocolate, nut butters, juices including cold-pressed juice, hot-eating desserts, cookies, frozen fruit and vegetables, pre-cut fresh fruit, refrigerated and frozen plant-based meat-alternative products, jams, fruit spreads, jelly, honey, natural sweeteners and marmalade products, as well as other food products. Grocery products accounted for approximately 74% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019, 75% in fiscal 2018 and 74% in fiscal 2017.
Snacks
Our snack products include a variety of potato, root vegetable and other exotic vegetable chips, straws, tortilla chips, whole grain chips, pita chips and puffs. Snack products accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019, 12% in fiscal 2018 and 13% in fiscal 2017.
Personal Care
Our personal care products cover a variety of personal care categories including skin, hair and oral care, deodorants, baby care items, body washes, sunscreens and lotions. Personal care products accounted for approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales in each of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Tea
Under the Celestial Seasonings® brand, we currently offer more than 100 varieties of herbal, green, black, wellness, rooibos and chai tea. Tea products accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Seasonality
Certain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, baking products, hot cereal, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our prepared food and personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters.
Working Capital
For information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Capital Expenditures
During fiscal 2019, our aggregate capital expenditures from continuing operations were $77.1 million. We expect to spend approximately $70 million to $80 million for capital projects in fiscal 2020.
Segments
We principally manage our business by geography in seven operating segments: the United States, United Kingdom, Tilda, Ella’s Kitchen UK, Canada, Europe and Hain Ventures.  In addition, we have three reportable segments: United States, United Kingdom and Rest of World.

In fiscal 2018, the Hain Pure Protein operations, including HPPC and Empire, were classified as discontinued operations as discussed in Note 5, Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Therefore, segment information presented excludes the results of Hain Pure Protein.
On August 27, 2019, we sold our Tilda business as discussed in Note 21, Subsequent Event in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Each segment includes the results of operations attributable to its geographic location except for Hain Ventures, which conducts business in the United States, Canada and Europe which are included in the Rest of World segment. 
We use segment net sales and operating income to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources.  We believe this measure is most relevant in order to analyze segment results and trends.  Segment operating income excludes certain general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), impairment and acquisition related expenses, restructuring, integration and other charges.
The following table presents the Company’s net sales by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands, other than percentages which may not add due to rounding):

 | Fiscal Year Ended June 30,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
United States | $ | 1,009,406 | | 44 | % | | $ | 1,084,871 | | 44 | % | $ | 1,107,806 | 47 | %

New Product Initiatives Through Research and Development
Innovation, including new product development, is a key component of our growth strategy. We continuously seek to understand our consumers and develop products that address their desire for organic, natural and better-for-you alternatives to conventional packaged foods and personal care products. We have a demonstrated track record of extending our product offerings into other product categories. A team of professional product developers, including microbiologists, nutritionists, food scientists, chefs and chemists, work to develop products to meet changing consumer needs. Our research and development staff incorporates product ideas from all areas of our business in order to formulate new products. In addition to developing new products, the research and development staff routinely reformulates and improves existing products based on advances in ingredients, packaging and technology. We incurred approximately $11.1 million in company-sponsored research and development activities, consisting primarily of personnel-related costs, in fiscal 2019, $9.7 million in 2018 and $10.1 million in 2017. In addition to our company-sponsored research and development activities, in order to quickly and economically introduce our new products to market, we may partner with contract manufacturers that make our products according to our formulas or other specifications. The Company also partners with certain customers from time to time on exclusive customer initiatives. The Company’s research and development expenditures do not include the expenditures on such activities undertaken by co-packers and suppliers who develop numerous products on behalf of the Company and on their own initiative with the expectation that the Company will accept their new product ideas and market them under the Company’s brands.

See “Item 2: Properties” of this Form 10-K for more information on the manufacturing facilities that we operate. 
Co-Packers
In addition to the products manufactured in our own facilities, independent third-party manufacturers, who are referred to in our industry as “co-packers,” manufacture many of our products. In general, utilizing co-packers provides us with the flexibility to produce a large variety of products and the ability to enter new categories quickly and economically. Our contract manufacturers have been selected based on their production capabilities, capitalization and their specific product category expertise, and we expect to continue to partner with them to improve and expand our product offerings.  During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 41%, 42% and 41%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from products manufactured by co-packers. We require that our co-packers comply with all applicable regulations and our quality and food safety program requirements, and compliance is verified through auditing and other activities. Additionally, the co-packers are required to ensure our products are manufactured in accordance with our finished good specifications to ensure we meet customer expectations.
Suppliers of Ingredients and Packaging
Agricultural commodities and ingredients, including almonds, corn, dairy, fruit and vegetables, oils, rice, soybeans and wheat, are the principal inputs used in our products. Our certified organic and natural raw materials as well as our packaging materials are obtained from various suppliers around the world. The Company works with its suppliers to ensure the quality and safety of their ingredients and that such ingredients meet our specifications and comply with applicable regulations. These assurances are supported by our purchasing contracts, supplier expectations manual and technical assessments, including questionnaires, scientific data, certifications, affidavits, certificates of analysis and analytical testing, where required. Our purchasers and quality team visit major suppliers around the world to procure competitively priced, quality ingredients that meet our specifications.
We maintain long-term relationships with many of our suppliers. Purchase arrangements with ingredient suppliers are generally made annually. Purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts, and price, delivery terms and product specifications vary.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with both large mainstream conventional packaged goods companies and natural and organic packaged foods companies. Many of these competitors enjoy significantly greater resources. Large mainstream conventional packaged goods competitors include Campbell Soup Company, Mondelez International, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Danone S.A., The J.M. Smucker Company, Kellogg Company, The Kraft Heinz Company, Nestle S.A., PepsiCo, Inc., The Hershey Company, Conagra Brands, Inc. and Unilever, and conventional personal care products companies with whom we compete include, but are not limited to, The Proctor & Gamble Company, Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive Company. Certain of these large mainstream conventional packaged foods and personal care companies compete with us by selling both conventional products and natural and/or organic products. Natural and organic packaged foods competitors include Chobani LLC, Nature’s Bounty Inc., Clif Bar & Company and Amy’s Kitchen. In addition to these competitors, in each of our categories we compete with many regional and small, local niche brands. Given limited retailer shelf space and merchandising events, competitors actively support their respective brands with marketing, advertising and promotional spending. In addition, most retailers market similar items under their own private label, which compete for the same shelf space.
Competitive factors in the packaged foods industry include product quality and taste, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety, interesting or unique product names, product packaging and package design, shelf space, reputation, price, advertising, promotion and nutritional claims.

Under various statutes, these agencies prescribe and establish, among other things, the requirements and standards for quality, safety and representation of our products to the consumer in labeling and advertising.
Internationally, we are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products, including the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Canada and European Food Safety Authority which supports the European Commission, as well as individual country, province, state and local regulations.
Quality Control
We utilize a comprehensive food safety and quality management program, which employs strict manufacturing procedures, expert technical knowledge on food safety science, employee training, ongoing process innovation, use of quality ingredients and both internal and independent auditing. 
In the United States, each of our own manufacturing facilities has a Food Safety Plan (“FSP”), which focuses on preventing food safety risks and is compliant with the requirements set forth under the Food Safety and Modernization Act (“FSMA”). In addition, each facility has at least one Preventive Controls Qualified Individual (“PCQI”) who has successfully completed training in the development and application of risk-based preventive controls at least equivalent to that received under a standardized curriculum recognized by the FDA. 
All of our Hain-owned manufacturing sites and a significant number of our co-packers are certified against a standard recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”) including Safe Quality Foods (“SQF”) and British Retail Consortium (“BRC”). These standards are integrated food safety and quality management protocols designed specifically for the food sector and offer a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality. Certification provides an independent and external validation that a product, process or service complies with applicable regulations and standards.
In addition to third-party inspections of our co-packers, we have instituted audits to address topics such as allergen control; ingredient, packaging and product specifications; and sanitation. Under FSMA, each of our contract manufacturers is required to have a FSP, a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plant (“HACCP”) plan or a hazard analysis critical control points plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards.

Independent Certification
In the United States, our organic products are certified in accordance with the USDA’s National Organic Program through Quality Assurance International (“QAI”), a third-party certifying agency. For products marketed as organic outside of the United States, we use accredited certifying agencies to ensure compliance with country-specific government regulations for selling organic products or reciprocity, where available.
Many of our products are certified kosher under the supervision of accredited agencies including The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations and “KOF-K” Kosher Supervision.
We also work with other non-governmental organizations such as NSF International, which developed the NSF/ANSI 305 Standard for Personal Care Products Containing Organic Ingredients and provides third-party certification through QAI for our personal care products in the absence of an established government regulation for these products. In addition, we work with other nongovernmental organizations such as the Gluten Free Intolerance Group, Whole Grain Council and the Non-GMO Project.
Currently all of our Hain-owned facilities are GFSI compliant and audited by external certification bodies.  90% of our FDA regulated food facilities have achieved a GFSI certification.
