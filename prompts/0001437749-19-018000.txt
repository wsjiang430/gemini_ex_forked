Our Company

LSI is a performance-based outdoor lighting company. We provide best-in-class solutions to our customers that include bringing select indoor and specialty lighting products to a broad number of vertical markets and specific applications. We look to bundle these products with our graphics, digital graphics, and lighting solutions to create a differentiated and unique offering to our customers. Our products and services include digital signage, printed and structural graphics, and electrical signage capabilities, a wide variety of high quality indoor and outdoor lighting products, lighting control systems, and related professional services including engineering, installation, and project management. We also provide graphics and lighting products on a stand-alone basis. Our company is the leading provider of corporate visual image solutions to the petroleum / convenience store industry. We use this leadership position to penetrate national retailers and multi-site retailers, including quick service and casual restaurants, retail chain stores and automobile dealerships, located primarily in the United States. We seek to expand our market share in the traditional commercial / industrial lighting market by combining our LED product innovation and lighting control solutions utilizing the latest technology along with a strong emphasis on high service levels and market focused solutions. Our solutions are targeted at both renovation and new construction markets. We have comprehensive design and product development capabilities for targeted markets. We also provide a variety of lighting control solutions which allow our customers to reduce energy and maintenance costs. In addition to designing and producing traditional signage, we design and integrate digital signage technology where customers are provided a turnkey solution that includes design, software, hardware content development, implementation, service and support.
 
We believe that national retailers and other companies in the markets we serve are increasingly seeking single-source suppliers with the project management skills and service expertise necessary to execute a comprehensive visual image program. The integration of our graphics, lighting, and technology coupled with our professional services capabilities allows our customers to outsource to us the development of an entire visual image program from the planning and design stage through installation. Our approach is to combine our lighting products and custom graphics applications utilizing the latest technology along with our professional service capabilities to create complete customer-focused visual image solutions. We also offer our lighting products and graphics elements on a stand-alone basis to service our existing image solutions customers, to establish a presence in a new market or to create a relationship with a new customer. We believe that our ability to combine lighting, graphics, and technology coupled with professional services into a comprehensive visual image solution differentiates us from our competitors who offer only stand-alone products for lighting or graphics and who lack professional services offerings. During the past several years, we have continued to enhance our ability to provide comprehensive corporate visual image solutions by adding additional graphics capabilities such as digital signage and media content management, wireless lighting control systems, new and innovative LED lighting products and professional services through acquisitions and internal development.
 
Our focus on product development and innovation creates products that are essential components of our customers’ corporate visual image strategy. Our spending on research and development was $5.3 million in fiscal 2019 and $6.0 million in fiscal 2018. We develop and manufacture lighting including solid-state LED lighting, lighting control systems, and graphics and distribute them through an extensive multi-channel distribution network that allows us to effectively service our target markets. Customers include distributors, franchisees and national end-user corporate accounts.
 
We also focus on the elimination of non-value added activities throughout our organization through the LSI Business System, a Lean Management System utilizing Kaizen events and lean tools to drive continuous improvement in our processes. The LSI Business System improves shareholder value by increasing customer satisfaction and eliminating waste, both of which will improve the bottom line. We are committed to this company-wide initiative through employee education and training with the ultimate goal to make it part of the corporate culture and way of thinking of all employees.

Lighting Segment

Our Lighting Segment manufactures and markets outdoor and indoor lighting and lighting controls for the commercial, industrial and multi-site retail markets including the petroleum / convenience store, quick-service, and automotive markets. Our products are designed and manufactured to provide maximum value and meet the high-quality, competitively-priced product requirements of the markets we serve. We generally avoid specialty or custom-designed, low-volume products for single order opportunities. Focusing on key market applications allows us to deliver unique product solutions which in turn provides value to our customers.
 
Our lighting fixtures, poles and brackets are produced in a variety of designs, styles and finishes. Important functional variations include types of mounting, such as pole, bracket and surface, and the nature of the light requirement, such as interior and exterior down-lighting, wall-wash lighting, canopy lighting, flood-lighting, area lighting and security lighting. Our engineering staff performs photometric analyses and wind load safety studies for all light fixtures and also designs our fixtures and lighting systems. Our lighting products utilize LED light sources. The major products and services offered within our lighting segment include: exterior area lighting, interior lighting, canopy lighting, landscape lighting, lighting controls, light poles, lighting system design, and photometric layouts. All of our products are designed for performance, reliability, ease of installation and service, as well as attractive appearance. The Company also has a focus on designing lighting system solutions and implementing strategies related to energy savings in substantially all markets served.
 
We offer our customers expertise in developing and utilizing high-performance solid-state LED solutions, which when combined with the Company’s lighting fixture expertise and control technology, has the potential to result in a broad spectrum of white light LED fixtures that offer equivalent or improved lighting performance with significant energy and maintenance savings as compared to conventional light sources.
 
Graphics Segment

Our Graphics Segment manufactures and sells exterior and interior visual image elements related to signage and graphics, including integrated digital signage solutions and menu boards. The major products and services offered within our Graphics Segment include the following: signage and canopy graphics, pump dispenser graphics, building fascia graphics, electrical signage, decals, interior signage and marketing graphics, aisle markers, wall mural graphics, fleet graphics, video boards, menu boards and digital signage and media content management. Our Company also manages and executes the implementation of large rollout programs. These products are used in graphics displays and visual image programs in several markets, including the petroleum / convenience store market, quick-service restaurant, grocery, and multi-site retail operations. Our extensive lighting and graphics expertise, product offering, visual image solution implementation capabilities and other professional services represent significant competitive advantages. We work with our customers and design firms to establish and implement cost effective corporate visual image programs to advance our customer’s brand. Increasingly, we have become the primary supplier of exterior and interior graphics for our customers. We also offer installation management services for those customers who require the installation of interior or exterior products (utilizing pre-qualified independent subcontractors throughout the United States).
 
Our business can be significantly impacted by participation in a customer’s “image conversion program,” especially if it were to involve a “roll out” of that new image to a significant number of that customer’s and its franchisees’ retail sites. The impact to our business can be very positive with growth in net sales and profitability when we are engaged in an image conversion program. This can be followed in subsequent periods by lesser amounts of business or negative comparisons following completion of an image conversion program, unless we are successful in replacing that completed business with participation in new image conversion programs of similar size with one or more customers. An image conversion program can potentially involve any or all of the following improvements, changes or refurbishments at a customer’s retail site: interior or exterior lighting (see discussion above about our lighting segment), interior or exterior store signage and graphics, and installation of these products in both the prototype and roll out phases of their program.

Our Competitive Strengths

Single Source Comprehensive Visual Image Solution Provider. We believe that we are the only company serving our target markets that combines digital signage and graphics capabilities, lighting products and installation implementation capabilities to create comprehensive image solutions. We believe that our position as a single-source provider creates a competitive advantage over competitors who can only address either the lighting or the graphics component of a customer’s corporate visual image program. Using our broad visual image solutions capabilities, our customers can maintain complete control over the creation of their visual image programs while avoiding the added complexity of coordinating separate lighting and graphics suppliers and service providers. We can use high technology software to produce computer-generated virtual prototypes of a customer’s new or improved retail site image. We believe that these capabilities are unique to our target markets and they allow our customers to make educated, cost-effective decisions quickly.
Proven Ability to Penetrate Target Markets. We have grown our business by establishing a leadership position in many of the markets we serve, including petroleum / convenience stores, automobile dealerships and specialty retailers. Although our relationship with our customers may begin with the need for a single product or service, we leverage our broad product and service offering to identify additional products and solutions. We promote the combination of graphics, lighting, and technology, along with image element offerings, and services to create comprehensive solutions for our customers.
Focus on Product Innovation. We believe that our ability to successfully identify, develop and patent new products has allowed us to expand our market opportunity and enhance our market position. Our product innovation initiatives are designed to increase the value of our product offering by addressing the needs of our customers and target markets through retrofit enhancements to existing products or the development of new products. New product development includes developing an expanding portfolio of technology patents. We believe our product innovation process creates value for our customers by producing products that offer energy efficiency, low maintenance requirements and long-term operating performance at competitive prices based upon the latest technologies available.
 
Strong Relationships with our Customers. We have used our innovative products and high-quality services to develop close, long-standing relationships with a large number of our customers. Many of our customers are recognized among the leaders in their respective markets. Their use of our products and services raises the visibility of our capabilities and facilitates the acceptance of our products and services in their markets. Within each of these markets, our ability to be a single source provider of image solutions often creates repeat business opportunities through corporate reimaging programs. We have served some of our customers since our inception in 1976.
 
An Appropriately Capitalized Balance Sheet. As part of our long-term operating strategy, we believe the Company maintains a conservative capital structure. With a solid equity base, we are able to preserve operating flexibility in times of industry expansion and contraction. In the current business environment, a strong balance sheet demonstrates financial viability to our existing and targeted customers. In addition, a strong balance sheet enables us to invest in the company through research and development and allows the Company to invest in capital projects that support the Company’s growth.
Customer Product Training and Education Centers. We conduct product training and education for our customers, contractors, and channel partners at our multiple locations. These centers, which demonstrate the depth and breadth of our product and service offerings, have become an effective component of our sales process. These centers can also provide a visual illustration of lighting solutions to our customers.
Maintain our Vertically Integrated Business Model. Our Company balances its strength as a vertically integrated manufacturer with its sourcing of purchased finished goods through the global supply chain. We focus on developing lighting and graphics products coupled with technology, and outsource certain non-core processes and product components as necessary.
Commitment to Continuous Improvement. We are committed to a philosophy of continuous improvement through the LSI Business System, which is a Lean Management System utilizing Kaizen events and lean tools to identify and eliminate waste and increase customer satisfaction with the ultimate goal to improve shareholder value.

Sales, Marketing and Customers

Sales: Our lighting products including lighting controls, are sold primarily throughout the United States, but also in Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Latin America (less than 5% of consolidated net sales are outside the United States) using a combination of regional sales managers and independent sales representatives serving primarily the commercial / industrial market along with several of the other markets we serve. Our lighting product sales originate from two primary revenue streams. The first revenue stream is from project-based business, quoting and receiving orders as a preferred vendor for product sales to multiple end-users, including customer-owned as well as franchised and licensed dealer operations. The second revenue stream is from selling standard product to stocking distributors, who subsequently provide product to electrical contractors and end users for a variety of lighting applications. Our graphics products, which in many instances are program-driven, are sold primarily through our own sales force. Our marketing approach and means of distribution vary by product line and by market.
 
Sales are developed through a wide variety of contacts such as, but not limited to, national retail marketers, branded product companies, franchise and dealer operations. In addition, sales are also achieved through recommendations from local architects, engineers, petroleum and electrical distributors and contractors. The Company utilizes the latest technology to track sales leads and customer quotes with the ultimate goal to turn them into orders from our customers. Our sales are partially seasonal as installation of outdoor lighting and graphic systems in the northern states decreases during the winter months.
 
Marketing: The capabilities of our Image Center and I-Zone Marketing Centers are important parts of our sales process. These centers, unique within the lighting and graphics industry, are facilities that can produce a computer-generated virtual prototype of a customer’s facility on a large screen through the combination of high technology software and audio/visual presentation. The I-Zone marketing center is a digitally controlled facility containing a large solid-state LED video screen and several displays that showcase our LED technology and LED products. With these capabilities, our customers can instantly explore a wide variety of lighting and graphics alternatives to develop consistent day and nighttime images. These centers give our customers more options, greater control, and more effective time utilization in the development of lighting, graphics and visual image solutions, all with much less expense than traditional prototyping. In addition to being cost and time effective for our customers, we believe that the capabilities of these marketing centers contribute to the development of the best solution for our customers’ needs.
 
The Image and I-Zone marketing centers also contain comprehensive indoor and outdoor product display areas that allow our customers to see many of our products and services in one setting. This aids our customers in making quick and effective lighting and graphic design decisions through hands-on product demonstrations and side-by-side comparisons. More importantly, these capabilities allow us to expand our customer’s interest from just a single product into other products and solutions. We believe that the capabilities of these centers have further enhanced our position as a highly qualified outsourcing partner capable of guiding a customer through image alternatives utilizing our lighting and graphics products and services. We believe this capability distinguishes us from our competitors and will become increasingly beneficial in attracting additional customers.
 
In addition to the capabilities of our Image and I-Zone Marketing Centers, the Company markets its products and service capabilities to end users in multiple channels through a broad spectrum of marketing and promotional methods, including direct customer contact, trade shows, on-site training, print advertising in industry publications, product brochures and other literature, as well as the internet and social media.
 
Manufacturing and Operations

We design, engineer and manufacture most of our lighting and graphics products through utilizing lean manufacturing principles. We periodically invest in new machinery and equipment utilizing the latest technology in order to leverage the manufacturing efficiencies gained from our high-volume production. When appropriate, we utilize alliances with domestic and international vendors to outsource certain products and components. The majority of products and related software are engineered, designed and final-assembled by the Company, while a portion of the manufacturing has been performed by select qualified vendors. We are not dependent on any one supplier for critical component parts.
 
The principal raw materials and purchased components used in the manufacturing of our products are steel, aluminum, aluminum castings, fabrications, LEDs, power supplies, powder paint, steel tubing, wire harnesses, acrylic, silicon and glass lenses, inks, various graphics substrates such as foam board and vinyls, and digital screens. We source these materials and components from a variety of suppliers. Although an interruption of these supplies and components could disrupt our operations, we believe generally that alternative sources of supply exist and could be readily arranged. We strive to reduce price volatility in our purchases of raw materials and components through annual contracts with strategic suppliers. Our Lighting operations generally carry a certain level of sub-assemblies and finished goods inventory to meet quick delivery requirements. Most lighting products are made to order and shipped shortly after they are manufactured. Our Graphics operations manufacture custom graphics products for customers who require us to stock certain amounts of finished goods in exchange for their commitment to that inventory.  Our digital signage business requires an investment in digital screens in order to meet the demands of a large roll-out program. In some Graphics programs, customers also give us a cash advance for the inventory that we stock for them.  The Company’s operations dealing with LED products generally carry LED and LED component inventory due to longer lead times.

We currently operate out of eight manufacturing and office facilities in four U.S. states. Excluded from the list of facilities is the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility which is reported as an asset held for sale as of June 30, 2019.
 
Most of our operations received ISO 9001:2015 Certification thru ANAB (Cert# 5369-Eagle Registrations Inc.) with plans to certify the Company’s other facilities. Our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety. We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures with regard to these matters and believe our facilities are in compliance with such regulations.
 
Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment

There was no impairment of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. The Company recorded a $20,165,000 impairment of goodwill in the Lighting Segment in fiscal year 2019 and a $28,000,000 goodwill impairment to the same reporting unit in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018.
Competition
 
We experience strong competition in all segments of our business, and in all markets served by our product lines. Although we have many competitors, some of which have greater financial and other resources, we do not compete with the same companies across our entire product and service offerings. We believe product quality and performance, price, customer service, prompt delivery, and reputation to be important competitive factors. We also have several product and process patents which have been obtained in the normal course of business which provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Additional Information

Our sales are partially seasonal as installation of outdoor lighting and graphic systems in the northern states lessens during the winter months. We had a backlog of orders, which we believe to be firm, of $30.7 million and $28.8 million at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All orders are expected to be shippable or installed within twelve months.
 
We have 1,065 full-time employees and 181 agency employees as of June 30, 2019. We offer a comprehensive compensation and benefits program to our employees, including competitive wages, medical and dental insurance, an incentive plan that is based upon the achievement of the Company’s business plan goals, a 401(k) retirement savings plan and, for certain employees, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and an equity based incentive plan.
