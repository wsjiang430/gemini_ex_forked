ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Overview
 
MedoveX was incorporated in Nevada on July 30, 2013 as SpineZ Corp. MedoveX is the parent company of Debride Inc., (“Debride”), which was incorporated under the laws of Florida on October 1, 2012 but did not commence operations until February 1, 2013. SpineZ Corp. changed its name to MedoveX Corp. and effected a 2-for-1 reverse split of its stock in March 2014.
 
The Company is in the business of designing and marketing proprietary medical devices for commercial use in the United States and Europe. The Company received CE marking in June 2017 for the DenerveX System and it is now commercially available throughout the European Union and several other countries that accept CE marking. The Company’s first sale of the DenerveX System occurred in July 2017. The Company still intends to seek approval for the DenerveX System from the Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the United States.
 
In October 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), and subsequently amended in January 2019 (the “APA Amendment”) with Regenerative Medicine Solutions, LLC (“RMS”), Lung Institute LLC, RMS Lung Institute Management LLC, Cognitive Health Institute Tampa, LLC, RMS Shareholder, LLC and RMS Acquisition Corp. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased all of the assets of RMS, Cognitive Health Institute Tampa, LLC, Lung Institute LLC and RMS Lung Institute Management LLC. The Company executed the Asset Purchase Agreement on January 8, 2019.
 
The DenerveX Device
 
Our first acquisition was the DenerveX device. We believe that the DenerveX device can be used to encompass several medical applications, including pain relief.
 
The Company acquired the DenerveX patent on January 31, 2013 from Scott Haufe, M.D. (“Dr. Haufe”), a former director of the Company, in exchange for 750,108 shares of common stock in the Company and a 1% royalty on all sales of any product sold based on the patent. In September 2013, we entered into a Co-Development Agreement with James Andrews, M.D. (“Dr. Andrews”), a former director of the Company, whereby Dr. Andrews committed to further evaluate the DenerveX device and to seek to make modifications and improvements to such technology. In exchange for such services, the Company agreed to pay Dr. Andrews a royalty equal to two (2%) percent of the DenerveX net sales during the five (5) year term of the Co-Development Agreement. Upon the termination of the term of the Co-Development Agreement, which has a minimum term of five (5) years, then the royalty payable to Dr. Andrews shall be reduced to one (1%) percent of DenerveX net sales after such termination of products covered by any U.S. patent on which Dr. Andrews is listed as a co-inventor; if any such patents are obtained. Such one (1%) percent royalty shall continue during the effectiveness of such patent. Pursuant to the Co-Development Agreement, Dr. Andrews agreed to assign any modifications or improvements to the DenerveX to the Company subject to the royalty rights described above. The Co-Development agreement with Dr. Andrews expired September 30, 2018, and management has no intention to re-enter into this agreement.
 
We are marketing the product as a disposable, single-use kit which includes all components of the DenerveX device product. In addition to the DenerveX device itself, we have developed a dedicated Electro Surgical Generator, the DenerveX Pro-40, to power the DenerveX device.  There is currently no finished good product of the DenerveX device in inventory as commercial production  is currently on-hold. The Company anticipates the resumption of manufacturing in Q4 2019.
 
The generator is provided to customers agreeing to purchase the DenerveX device and cannot be used for any other purpose.
 
We accepted a proposal from Devicix, a third party design and development firm located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in November 2013, to develop a prototype device. This proposal included a 5-phase development plan, culminating in the production ready prototype that could be used for validation purposes. We have recently completed the final stages of the build and test phase of the device, culminating in receiving CE marking to market the product in Europe. The DenerveX Kit and Pro-40 generator is now in commercial production. We anticipate very minimal, if any, additional build and test related expenses, which consists of product design verification activities, in the future as we launch the DenerveX System in Europe. Through December 31, 2018, we have incurred expenses of approximately $1,950,000 to Devicix.

In November 2014, we selected Nortech Systems Inc. (“Nortech”), a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based FDA registered contract manufacturer, to produce test DenerveX devices from the prototype supplied by Devicix for use in final development and non-clinical testing. The agreement with Nortech includes agreed upon per unit prices for delivery of the devices. Actual work on development of the final units began in November 2014. Through December 31, 2018, we have incurred expenses of approximately $997,000 to Nortech. Commercial production  of the DenerveX device is currently on-hold at Nortech. The Company anticipates the resumption of manufacturing in Q4 2019.
 
Also in November 2014, we engaged Bovie Medical Corporation (“Bovie”), a Delaware Corporation, to develop the Electro Surgical Generator and provide post production support services. Per our agreement with Bovie, we are invoiced based on deliverables produced by Bovie, which was originally supposed to amount to $295,000 upon completion of all the deliverables. Through December 31, 2018, we have incurred expenses of approximately $441,000 to Bovie for production services. The original $295,000 agreement was a base number along the pathway of development.
 
Additional requirements were incurred as the research and development process progressed and as a result certain prices increased and additional costs were incurred to further customize the DenerveX System.
 
Streamline, Inc. Divestiture
 
In May 2016, the Board of Directors authorized management to seek buyers for Streamline, Inc., (“Streamline”), the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary acquired in March 2015. The Company sold all Streamline related assets on December 7, 2016 (the “Closing”).
 
The transaction resulted in the immediate receipt of $500,000 in cash, and a $150,000 receivable to the Company due on or before January 1, 2018. The Company subsequently received the $150,000 per the terms of the asset purchase agreement on January 2, 2018.
 
The terms of the agreement also required that for each of the calendar years ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 (each such calendar year, a “Contingent Period”), a contingent payment in cash (each, a “Contingent Payment”) equal to five percent (5%) of the total net sales received by the acquiring party from the sale of “IV suspension system” products in excess of 100 units during each Contingent Period. Each such Contingent Payment is payable to the Company by the acquiring party by no later than March 31st of the subsequent year; provided, however, that the total aggregate amount of all Contingent Payments owed by the acquiring party to the Company for all Contingent Periods will not exceed $850,000. The Company is yet to receive any Contingent Payments and has no reason to expect it will receive any Contingent Payments.
 
Competition
 
Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. We face intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major medical products companies. We may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products. Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered part of the standard of care. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are:

● | the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceptance by surgeons and the medical device market generally; 
● | ease of use and reliability; 
● | technical leadership and superiority; 
● | effective marketing and distribution; 
● | speed to market; and 
● | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement.

We will also compete in the marketplace to recruit qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business.
 
We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in our current and future products areas. With regard to the DenerveX System, we believe that our principal competitors include device manufacturers Cosman Medical Inc., Stryker Corporation and Spembly Medical Systems. We may also face competition from developing, but potentially untested technologies such as Zyga’s GLYDER device. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve widespread market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective.
 
Customers
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval.
 
We sell to local distributors in the countries where we currently sell the DenerveX System with the exception of Germany, where we sell directly to hospitals and providers . There is currently no finished goods product of the DenerveX device in inventory as commercial production  is currently on-hold. The Company anticipates the resumption of manufacturing in Q4 2019.
 
Intellectual Property
 
A key element of our success depends on our ability to identify and create proprietary medical device technologies. In order to proactively protect those proprietary technologies, we intend to continue to develop and enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally, as well as through the use of trade secrets, domain names and contractual agreements such as confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements.
 
Currently, our intellectual property rights include the intellectual property acquired from Debride, Inc., which includes the U.S. Patent 8,167,879 B2 (the “Patent”). The Patent was originally filed in 2009 and was issued on May 1, 2012. We intend to leverage the Patent to the fullest extent possible through market development and prosecution of our rights under the Patent.
 
In addition, we have filed 33 additional US and International patents, of which 21 are pending, 8 are pending published, and 4 have been granted. These patents cover a total of 885 claims both in the United States and Internationally.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent.
 
We intend to continually re-assess and refine our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify our position in our market space in the United States and internationally. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications should our intellectual property strategy require such filings and/or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities.
 
Many biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the medical device field and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Internally, we have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. Also, we generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us.
 
In order to contend with the possibility of third party intellectual property conflicts, we review and assess the third-party intellectual property landscape for competitive and other developments that may inform or impact our intellectual property development and commercialization strategies. We may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third party intellectual property holders. Where licenses are readily available at reasonable cost, such licenses are considered a normal cost of doing business. In other instances, however, where a third party holds relevant property and is a direct competitor, a license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or available at all. We will attempt to manage the risk that such third party intellectual property may pose by conducting, among other measures, freedom-to-operate studies to guide our early-stage research away from areas where we are likely to encounter obstacles in the form of third party intellectual property.

Government Regulations
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
European Union and Other Country Approvals
 
The Company received CE marking in June 2017 for the DenerveX System. It can now be sold throughout the European Union and countries that accept CE Mark.
 
Aside from the European Union, we may seek regulatory approval for commercialization of the DenerveX System from Columbia, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, Israel, New Zealand, Australia and other countries where the management of the Company deems it to be suitable for commercialization. The documentation required to accompany the CE Mark to obtain regulatory approval in the aforementioned countries may include copies of the ISO 13485 certification, the SGS certificate of approval and a statement of Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”).
 
FDA Regulation
 
The DenerveX System and any other product we may develop must be approved or cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies.
 
FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and products.
 
In the United States, the FDA subjects medical products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or to allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.
 
FDA Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 

● | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (often referred to as a 510(k) application), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
● | Class III: special controls and approval of a pre-market approval (“PMA”) application. 



In general, the higher the classification, the greater the time and cost to obtain approval to market. There are no “standardized” requirements for approval, even within each class. For example, the FDA could grant 510(k) status, but require a human clinical trial, a typical requirement of a PMA. They could also initially assign a device Class III status, but end up approving a device as a 510(k) device if certain requirements are met. The range of the number and expense of the various requirements is significant. The quickest and least expensive pathway would be 510(k) clearance with a review of existing data. The longest and most expensive path would be a PMA with extensive randomized human clinical trials. We cannot predict how the FDA will classify the DenerveX device, nor predict what requirements will be placed upon us to obtain market approval or clearance, or even if they will allow marketing of the DenerveX device at all. However, we believe the pathway that will be required by the FDA will be somewhere between the two extremes described above.

We still intend to apply to the FDA for 510(k) clearance for our DenerveX device. However, it is very possible the FDA will deny this request and require the more expensive de novo classification process or possibly the PMA process. It is possible that the company may choose to directly pursue the de novo classification process without filing a 510K which could reduce the overall FDA review time. The Company has budgeted based on the assumption that the PMA process will be required.
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another currently legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a currently legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a currently legally marketed device.
 
510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing.
 
In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. We believe that other medical devices which have been approved by the FDA have many aspects that are substantially similar to the DenerveX device, which may make obtaining 510(k) clearance possible. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require PMA. In addition, any additional claims the Company wished to make at a later date, such as the permanent relief of pain, may require a PMA. If the FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, they will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter, at which point the Company must submit and the FDA must approve a PMA or a de Novo classification before marketing can begin.
 
During the review of a 510(k) submission, the FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide that the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us.
 
Clinical Trials of Medical Devices
 
One or more clinical trials may be necessary to support an FDA submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or un-cleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or “IDE” application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board (“IRB”) has approved the study.
 
During any study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.

Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | the FDA Quality Systems Regulation (“QSR”), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product. 

 
We will continue to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.
International Regulation
 
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may seek to sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
European Good Manufacturing Practices
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice (“GMP”), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with GMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
 
Our third-party manufacturers have ISO certification which is generally one of the requirements for approval under the guidelines established in the European Union.
 
United States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 
In the United States, there are Federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of Federal and state laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments of over $50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials.

-

 

Although we intend to structure our future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of our products to comply with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of our business practices in the future could be subject to scrutiny and challenge by Federal or state enforcement officials under these laws.
 
Research, Product Development and Technical Operations Expense
 
Research and development costs and expenses consist primarily of fees paid to external service providers, laboratory testing, supplies, costs for facilities and equipment, and other costs for research and development activities. Research and development expenses are recorded in operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Estimates have been used in determining the expense liability of certain costs where services have been performed but not yet invoiced.
 
We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract for external service providers for activities through communications with the service providers to reflect the actual amount expended.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 6 total full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union and we believe our employee relations are good.
