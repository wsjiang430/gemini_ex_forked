Products
 
We have developed a series of soft and hard folding tonneau covers as well as energy products.
 
Soft Tonneau Covers
 
Our soft tonneau cover offering consists of vinyl wrapped tri- and quad-fold tonneau covers manufactured overseas in Meizhou, China. Enhanced versions of our vinyl tri-fold soft tonneau covers are now available for purchase and marketed under a “PRO” designation; our quad-fold soft tonneau covers will soon have an upgraded “PRO” version available as well. These upgraded versions include our patented quick latch system, which allows the operator to open the cover by simply pulling a release cable – enabling single-sided operation. Each soft cover is fitted with a powder-coated, lightweight aluminum frame and rear cam latches as well as ultra-violet (UV) protected, vinyl tri-layer material that seals around the truck bed with a rubber gasket designed to protect cargo from moisture and debris.
 
Tri-fold soft covers are a lower cost option when compared to quad-fold tonneau covers. Compared with Worksport tri-fold soft tonneau covers, Worksport quad-fold covers have the additional benefit of enabling full truck bed access by being foldable upwards toward the rear window of the truck. As the market’s first quad-folding vinyl-wrapped cover that will provide full truck bed access utilizing Worksport’s Intellectual Property, Worksport’s soft quad-fold covers are compact when folded parallel to the back window of the truck while avoiding obstruction of the rear brake light on most truck models.

Hard Tonneau Covers
 
Our hard line of tonneau covers includes tri- and quad-fold, aluminum flush-mounted and top-mounted folding tonneau covers. Our entire line of hard folding tonneau covers will be manufactured in the USA. Our hard cover panels are designed with formed aluminum, ultra-strong high temper formed alloy panels with a durable black surface. These panels will have significant dent resistance over many other tonneau covers as they use thicker aluminum on the exterior surface as opposed to the sandwich style of most covers today. Designed to auto index (center) in the truck bed and be only 7.5mm above the truck bed, it is a low profile, sleek look that is easy to install. Our hard covers will be offered with the XCX rail upgrade, allowing future accessories such as expandable cargo division and storage solutions. Similar to the soft cover line, our hard cover line products will each be available in upgraded versions utilizing our quick latch system, enabling single-sided operation.
 
Our hard tonneau cover line, all of which is in development, includes:
 

● | The Worksport TC3 – top-mounted hard tri-fold; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Worksport TC3 PRO – top-mounted hard tri-fold with Smart Latch system;

Energy Products
 
We are researching and developing various energy-based products, two of which can be sold together as a kit: the Worksport SOLIS tonneau cover (“SOLIS”) and the Worksport COR energy storage system (“COR”). This kit will be available for both end-consumers and Original Vehicle Manufactures alike. This kit integrates tonneau cover, solar energy capture, and portable energy storage technologies to convert pickup trucks to mobile microgrid power stations – allowing Worksport to compete within niche markets in each the automotive aftermarket accessory, solar energy, and portable power station markets.

Worksport SOLIS
 
The SOLIS, a tonneau cover with integrated solar panels, is a unique, folding tonneau cover design founded on our top-mounted tough cover design but with the addition of cutting edge, monocrystalline, semi-flexible solar panels and wiring system. These solar panels are secured to aluminum alloy panels both mechanically and using specialized adhesives, which ensure the covers are extremely strong, durable, and secure. The SOLIS cover is intended to be sold as an Original Equipment Manufacturer product, as it can be integrated into the design of leading electric pickup trucks; consequently, we have and will continue forging relationships with electric pickup truck manufacturers, including but not limited to Workhorse, Atlis, Bollinger, and Hercules as well as Toyota, Stellantis, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, and Rivian.
 
The solar panels that we plan to integrate into the SOLIS cover are capable of generating 170-180 watts per square meter. For example, as tested outdoors, the SOLIS cover is capable of generating approximately 460 watts of power on a RAM 6’5” truck bed. When integrated into the design of an electric pickup truck, this power generation can be converted to additional vehicle mileage. The specific added mileage is dependent on many factors including but not limited to region of the world in which the vehicle is driven, weather conditions, season, temperature, hours of sun light per day, and average irradiance. For example, assuming a solar power density of 170 W/m2, battery capacity of 98 kWh, mileage range of 300 miles, average hours of sun per day of 6 hours, average irradiance per day of 700 W/m2, and surface area of 2.7 m2, the SOLIS cover is estimated to provide 5.6 additional miles of range to an electric pickup truck per day.
 
Worksport COR
 
The COR or COR ESS (energy storage system) is a modular, portable power station uniquely designed to mount to the inside of a pickup truck bed and enable battery swapping without an immediate drop in power output. The COR built-in inverter with an output voltage of 120V AC (frequency of 60Hz) is capable of powering loads up to 3000W. Combined with its modular 48V batteries, it can store up to 6kWh of energy on the go. Each additional modular battery adds 1.5kWh of energy storage. The COR main battery, a Lithium battery, boasts a capacity of 1534Wh while its Hot Swap Lithium Iron Phosphate (Li-LFP) battery has a capacity of around 200Wh. The system allows Bluetooth connection for monitoring and controlling the COR system and its external batteries.
 
Not only does the COR system allow users to swap a depleted battery for a fully charged one, but it does so without a drop in power output for up to 15 seconds with a load of 3000W. This unique feature allows the COR system to be used in a variety of applications, including but not limited to sporting and outdoor activities, disaster relief and general emergencies, and vocational activities ranging from contractor to drone operator. While the COR system is designed to nicely complement the SOLIS tonneau cover, it will be purchasable as a standalone product – allowing consumers to utilize stored energy, whether captured via grid or grid-independent energy sources, anywhere. As Worksport’s first step into the energy storage market, the COR system is Worksport’s pioneer product within its future COR platform.
 
Manufacturing
 
As of December 31, 2022, all Worksport tonneau covers were manufactured in a facility located in Meizhou, China according to Worksport’s specifications, schematics and blueprints. We believe production at the factory can be increased within 30 days to facilitate volumes up to ten times the current output without any adverse effects on quality or craftsmanship.
 
We have purchased many production tools including injection molds, die cast molds, extrusion dies, and stamping dies – many of which are residing among foreign suppliers who are currently utilizing said tooling to produce needed components for manufacturing or assembly within the USA. We are concurrently diversifying this list raw material suppliers who can use our production tools to continue producing our tonneau cover components, should trade with any particular or preferred raw material supplier become more expensive or difficult.
 
In May of 2022, we purchased a 152,847 square foot production facility for domestic production, storage, and distribution, located in West Seneca, New York. We have received the majority of all manufacturing equipment deemed necessary to begin production, and we are in the process of installing and testing those machines, as well as training personnel to use those machines. Management believes that having manufacturing capability in North America will increase quality control and production efficiency, as well as lower landed costs and geopolitical risks.
 
Our Plant-Readiness Team believes that we will begin initial, basic manufacturing and/or assembly at our USA-based production facility within the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, improving our process on an on-going basis.

We currently hold a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of our parts and accessories and services. This includes patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Although we believe the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on such ownership, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
Patents
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s patent portfolio consists of eight (8) issued U.S. utility patents, one (1) issued Canadian utility patent, and twenty-seven (27) pending patent applications: eight (8) U.S. utility applications, seven (7) U.S. design applications, three (3) PCT applications, six (6) Canadian utility applications, one (1) Chinese invention application, and two (2) Chinese design applications. The Company is also in the process of preparing and filing several other utility and design patent applications across relevant countries and jurisdictions.

If issued, pending applications would expire 20 years from the filing date of each application, excluding the filing date of any provisional applications and excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent.
 
Trademarks
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company has 20 trademark registrations and 15 pending trademark applications in the United States, Canada, China, and European Union.
 
The Market
 
We primarily compete in the Automotive Aftermarket Accessories and New Energy industries with a focus on the Tonneau Cover and the Portable Power Station Markets.
 
Tonneau Cover Market
 
There are various forms of tonneau covers, each with their advantages and disadvantages, available for consumption through direct-to-consumer and retailer and dealer sales channels. Some forms of tonneau covers include but are not limited to:

● | Solid One Piece Caps and Lids; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Retractable Covers; 
● | Soft Folding & Roll-Up Covers; and 
● | Hard Folding & Standing Covers. 

 
Solid one piece covers and retractable covers tend to have limited functionality and tend to be priced higher when compared to other types of tonneau covers. Soft and hard folding/rolling tonneau covers, in contrast, tend to be priced more competitively and, as such, are a popular choice among tonneau cover consumers. Given these factors and our belief that we can develop less cumbersome, high functioning, and low cost soft and hard folding covers, we focus primarily on developing soft and hard folding covers.

Our tonneau cover revenue stream is largely proportional to sales of pickup trucks. Currently, there are 284.9 million vehicles in operation in the USA1, 21%, or 59.5 million, of which are pickup trucks.2 However, as a result of supply chain shortages, rising interest rates, high prices, and slowing sales, it may take until 2025 for new-vehicle sales to return to pre-pandemic levels.1 While new vehicle sales have decreased, we are well-positioned to capitalize on new vehicle sales; we offer tonneau covers for each of the 10 most popular makes/models by projected 2022-2029 sales (including, for example, the Ford F-Series, RAM Pickups, and Chevrolet Silverado), as well as the top 10 most accessorized pickup truck makes/models projected in 2022-2029.2 Within the USA market, pickup truck market revenue is expected to show a compound annual growth rate of 1.70% in 2023-2027.3 Within this market, pickup trucks are most popular within the southern region of the United States2, and the two largest state markets for pickup trucks are by far Texas and California.2 Globally, pickup truck market revenue is expected to show a compound annual growth rate of 1.01% in 2023-2027.4
 
Electric pickup trucks are projected to gain a larger portion of the pickup truck market share each year through 20351, as this submarket is estimated to have a compound annual growth rate of 29.7% between 2022 and 2023.5 However, a large headwind acting against this trend is that pickup trucks tend to be more popular in areas with less-developed charging infrastructure2 – a headwind that the SOLIS cover directly addresses and positions us favorably for possible partnerships and deals with electric pickup truck manufacturers.
 
The Specialty Equipment Aftermarket provides more specific insight into how often and for what reasons vehicle owners or renters are purchasing accessories for their vehicles. Despite crossover utility vehicles being the most common vehicle type on the road in the USA1, pickup trucks are the largest market by sales within the USA for specialty equipment – constituting 31% of this market2, which translated to $16 billion in sales during 2021.2 This market is expected to grow from $50.9 billion in 2021 to $58.66 billion by 2025.6 Within this pickup truck accessory market, 34% of accessories are truck bed & utility modifications2, which is the submarket in which we operate. Truck bed covers are among the top product categories for aftermarket accessory purchases in 20212, and the size of the tonneau cover market within the USA was valued at $3 billion as of 2021.7
 
As discretionary consumer goods, the specialty automotive part market is subject to consumer spending trends. Per capita disposable income fell 7.8% during 2022 as government stimulus ended; however, it is expected to increase slowly during 2023.8 Further, while the Federal Reserve has projected unemployment rates to increase in 2023 and subsequent years9, recent unemployment rates are the lowest they have been in recent decades.10 Together, these factors suggest consumer disposable income and unemployment will need to be carefully monitored in order to accurately forecast the automotive aftermarket accessories’ market potential year-to-year.
 
Consumers purchase automotive aftermarket accessories, as well as tonneau covers, specifically, for various reasons. According to recent reports, 97%, 92%, 80%, and 62% of pickup truck owners use their trucks for utility/work, travel/vacation, outdoor recreation, and off-road uses, respectively.2 Of those pickup truck owners who have purchased accessories for their trucks, 93%, 86%, 68%, and 43% of them use their pickup trucks for day trips, carrying tools/gear, light off-roading, and car camping, respectively.2 Pickup truck owners who use their vehicles for outdoor recreation, work, or off-roading are much more likely to purchase accessories when compared to those who use their vehicles for other purposes.2 Worksport’s tonneau covers largely benefit truck owners using their vehicles for any of these aforementioned purposes, and the SOLIS cover provides additional utility for those utilizing their trucks for utility/work, outdoor recreation, and car camping, in particular.
 
Sales of truck bed covers occur across several channels, among those including but not limited to part manufacturers, specialty retailers and online retailers. For physical location sales, the most popular sales channels for truck bed covers include Specialty Retailers/Installers and New Vehicle Dealerships, which constitute 17% and 11% of in-store sales, respectively.6 For online sales, the most popular sales channels for truck bed covers include Online Only General Retailer, Specialty Retailers/Installers, and Parts Manufacturers, which constitute 23%, 19%, and 8% of online sales, respectively.6 In the Fall of 2022, it was reported that roughly 59% of retailer specialty equipment sales were sold through in-store/physical channels while the other 41% were sold through online channels.11 It was further reported that roughly 50% of manufacturer specialty equipment sales were sold through in-store/physical channels while the other 50% were sold through online channels.11 Worksport aims to list its products on each of these highly-popular in-person and online sales channels in order to maximize sales volumes.

Portable Power Station Market
 
Compared to the Tonneau Cover Market, the Portable Power Station Market is much younger and globalized. Gas and diesel generators have long been used by consumers to generate electricity when they could not rely on the grid, whether it be for grid damages or the lack of grid in remote areas. Unlike such generators, portable power stations do not generate electricity, themselves, but can also be used to provide electricity during times of grid unreliability. These portable power stations are often charged by the grid via home outlets or independent of the grid via consumers’ vehicles or solar panels.
 
The Portable Power Station Market is large and growing. At a compound annual growth rate of 3.9% between 2022 and 20311, the global Portable Power Station market size was valued at $4.0 billion in 2021.1 Within this global market, the largest regional market is the North American market.2 The highest compound annual growth rates in this regional market is expected to be those power stations utilizing lithium-ion batteries for off-grid power applications2, which matches the COR system’s battery type as well as intended usage.
 
When paired with the SOLIS cover, the COR energy storage system will be a market outlier in that it can be charged safely while mobile whereas competing portable power stations are intended to be stationary during charging.

Distribution
 
We distribute our tonneau covers in Canada and the United States through an expanding network of wholesalers, private labels, distributors, and online retail channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and our own e-commerce platform hosted on Shopify. Distribution via each aforementioned channel is expected to increase during 2023. We have pursued and will continue to pursue relationships with Original Equipment Manufacturers with the intention of distributing through them as well.
 
The specialty equipment aftermarket consists of three major types of customers, which include master warehouse distributors and big box stores, dealers and wholesalers, and retail end consumers. Master warehouse distributors and big box stores stock and distribute products to their customers, which are usually local dealers and wholesalers. Dealers and wholesalers are local stores which sell products to some businesses and retail consumers in their area and online. Dealers purchase most of their products from their local distributor who deliver to them regularly. Retail end consumers are the end users of the products.

Competition
 
Tonneau Cover Competitors
 
The Tonneau Cover market is relatively consolidated with one industry leader, Real Truck (formerly Truck Hero), having the largest market share. Real Truck has acquired upwards of 16 independent tonneau cover brands in North America, allowing it to concurrently target many different niche markets but also potentially cannibalizing its own sales. We compete directly with Real Truck. Other competitors in this space include Truck Accessories Group (Primarily Leer), Agricover (primarily Access), Truck Covers USA, and Paragon.
 
We believe that being independent, innovative, operationally lean, and competitively priced will enable us to acquire a larger portion of the existing market share. In order to execute on this, we intend to have a small and effective sales team to forge strong business-to-business relationships, while turning inventory regularly through direct-to-consumer sales supported by a strong customer support team. Selling above MAP (Minimum Advertised Price) and enforcing this policy will allow business customers to sell without competing with us and in return support the growth of the distribution base. Our innovative covers are designed to serve purposes that no other tonneau cover is currently capable of, some of which are specifically geared towards improving margins for distributors. Further, the SOLIS cover’s inclusion of solar panels may be particularly attractive to electric pickup truck original equipment manufacturers, paving the path towards an original equipment manufacturer relationship that may be lucrative beyond standard tonneau cover partnerships.
 
Portable Power Station Competitors
 
The Portable Power Station market is global and highly fragmented and includes many competitors from across the world including but not limited to Alpha ESS Co., Ltd., Anker Technology, Bluetti, Chilwee Group Co., Ltd, Duracell, GES Group Limited Company, Jackery Inc., Lion Energy, Milwaukee Tool, and Mitsubishi Corporation. Some of these competitors offer a line of Portable Power Stations, each with different power capacities, sizes, and price points. Others specialize in few or even one Portable Power Station as to target a specific or niche submarket.
 
We intend to be competitive by focusing on our portable power station’s biggest strengths – primarily it’s modularity and Hot Swap battery. Modularity allows consumers not only to determine themselves the ideal stored energy capacity and price point they are seeking but also to upgrade their COR system overtime based on their evolving needs.
 
Supply of Components
 
Production of our soft and hard cover product lines requires components including but not limited to injection molded plastics, rubber hinges, rubber seals, foam corners, aluminum blanks, aluminum extrusions, and metal brackets. We believe that we can source materials needed for soft and hard tonneau cover production from other suppliers without major delay should any preferred supplier no longer be suitable.
 
For our domestically-assembled products, we have developed an extensive network of suppliers based in a diverse range of countries, including but not limited to the USA, China, Romania, Spain, Turkey, and Canada. We are further diversifying our supply chain of tonneau cover components by developing relationships with suppliers based in countries, including but not limited to Malaysia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Thailand, Poland, Finland, Italy, and Lithuania. For our COR and SOLIS components, we are establishing relationships with suppliers based in countries, including but not limited to China, Germany, Romania, Turkey, Philippines, and India. We actively seek to lower reliance on any country deemed a potential geo-political supply chain risk.
 
Research and Development
 
We invest in research and development activities on an ongoing basis. We are actively acquiring new engineering and design assets, both in-house and third-party. Our industrial engineers are based in both Canada and the United States, and they have developed and are further developing unique tonneau cover designs with enhanced user experience, cost-effective and sustainable materials, and automatable manufacturing potential. Our electrical engineers are based in Canada and work heavily on sourcing solar panels with features suitable for the Company’s SOLIS cover, as determined through deep product research and testing. Concurrently, the electrical engineering department is researching and developing more size- and cost-effective methods of portable energy storage in order to offer the market a competitive portable energy storage system with distinguishable and unique product features.

Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations
 
Globally, both the operation of our business and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.
Programs and Incentives
 
We have applied for and been granted tax, mortgage, wage, and energy cost relief in New York in addition to wage cost relief in Ontario. These programs are provided by several agencies including the Erie County Industrial Development Agency, Empire State Development, NY Power Authority, and The Canada Revenue Agency. Each of these incentive programs includes its own set of guidelines and requirements, including but not limited to timely eligibility reporting, environmental regulation compliance, and headcount projection realization – each of which we have agreed to and must abide by in order to continue realizing said incentives.
 
We continue to seek additional incentives and grants in order to lower our operational costs as well as commit less capital to new product initiatives.
 
Regulations
 
Our COR portable power station is subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We plan to conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.
 
We use lithium-ion cells in our energy storage products. The use, storage, and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
We are committed to high environmental standards and carry out our activities and operations in compliance with all relevant and applicable environmental regulations and best industry practices. Costs of environmental regulatory compliance are not expected to be significant.
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 25 employees, of which included 16 full-time employees in Canada and five full-time and four temporary employees in the USA. We intend to hire additional employees as operations grow – particularly within our West Seneca, NY manufacturing facility. We rely on few independent contractors for additional labor and are very selective in our use of consultants.
Practices and Policies
 
We are an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.
