Item 1. Business
General
  
 F & M Bank Corp. (the “Company” or “we”), incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is a one bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 that has elected to become a financial holding company. The Company owns 100% of the outstanding stock of its banking subsidiary, Farmers & Merchants Bank (“Bank”) and a majority interest in VSTitle, LLC (“VST”). TEB Life Insurance Company (“TEB”) and Farmers & Merchants Financial Services, Inc. (“FMFS”) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Bank. The Bank also holds a majority ownership in VBS Mortgage, LLC (DBA F&M Mortgage “F&M Mortgage”).
  
 The Bank was chartered on April 15, 1908, as a state chartered bank under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. TEB was incorporated on January 27, 1988, as a captive life insurance company under the laws of the State of Arizona. FMFS is a Virginia chartered corporation and was incorporated on February 25, 1993. F&M Mortgage was incorporated on May 11, 1999. The Bank purchased a majority interest in F&M Mortgage on November 3, 2008 and the Company purchased a majority interest in VST on January 1, 2017. F&M Mortgage owns the remaining minority interest in VST.
  
 As a commercial bank, the Bank offers a wide range of banking services including commercial and individual demand and time deposit accounts, commercial and individual loans, internet and mobile banking, drive-in banking services, ATMs at all branch locations and several off-site locations, as well as a courier service for its commercial banking customers. TEB was organized to re-insure credit life and accident and health insurance currently being sold by the Bank in connection with its lending activities. FMFS was organized to write title insurance but now provides brokerage services, commercial and personal lines of insurance to customers of the Bank. F&M Mortgage originates conventional and government sponsored mortgages through their offices in Harrisonburg, Woodstock and Fishersville. VST provides title insurance and real estate settlement services through their offices in Harrisonburg, Fishersville and Charlottesville, VA.
  
 The Bank makes various types of commercial and consumer loans and has a large portfolio of residential mortgages and indirect auto lending. The local economy is relatively diverse with strong employment in the agricultural, manufacturing, service and governmental sectors.
  
 The Company’s and the Bank’s principal executive office is located at 205 South Main Street, Timberville, VA 22853, and its phone number is (540) 896-8941.
  
 Filings with the SEC
  
 The Company files annual, quarterly and other reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These reports are posted and are available at no cost on the Company’s website, www.FMBankVA.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files such documents with the SEC. The Company’s filings are also available through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
  
 Employees
  
 On December 31, 2018, the Bank had 172 full-time and part-time employees; including executive officers, loan and other banking officers, branch personnel, operations personnel and other support personnel. None of the Company’s employees is represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Company considers their employee relations to be excellent. No one employee devotes full-time services to F & M Bank Corp.
Competition
  
 The Bank's offices face strong competition from numerous other financial institutions. These other institutions include large national and regional banks, other community banks, nationally chartered savings banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, loan production offices, marketplace lenders and other financial technology firms, mutual funds and life insurance companies. Competition for loans and deposits is affected by a variety of factors including interest rates, types of products offered, the number and location of branch offices, marketing strategies and the reputation of the Bank within the communities served.

Regulation and Supervision
  
 General. The operations of the Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state statutes, which apply to bank holding companies, financial holding companies and state member banks of the Federal Reserve System. The common stock of the Company is registered pursuant to and subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). These include, but are not limited to, the filing of annual, quarterly, and other current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). As an Exchange Act reporting company, the Company is directly affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”).  The Company believes it is in compliance with SEC and other rules and regulations implemented pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley and intends to comply with any applicable rules and regulations implemented in the future.
  
 The Company, as a bank holding company and a financial holding company, is subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act") and is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). The Act requires the Company to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before the Company acquires ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any institution, including another bank.
  
 As a financial holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as it may require pursuant to the Act. The Federal Reserve Board may also conduct examinations of F & M Bank Corp. and any or all of its subsidiaries. Under the Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with an extension of credit, pro-vision of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing of services.
  
 The permitted activities of a bank holding company are limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies, such as the Company, may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determinedby the Federal Reserve Board), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are financial in nature include but are not limited to securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments.Since 1994, the Company has entered into agreements with the Virginia Community Development Corporation to purchase equity positions in several Low-Income Housing Funds; these funds provide housing for low-income individuals throughout Virginia. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is necessary to engage in any of the activities described above or to acquire interests engaging in these activities.
  
 The Bank as a state member bank is supervised and regularly examined by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board; such supervision and examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not the stockholders of the Company.
  
 Payment of Dividends. The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company. Under the current regulatory guidelines, prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board is required if cash dividends declared in any given year exceed net income for that year, plus retained net profits of the two preceding years. A bank also may not declare a dividend out of or in excess of its net undivided profits without regulatory approval. The payment of dividends by the Bank or the Company may also be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines.
  
 Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Based on the Bank’s current financial condition, the Company does not expect that any of these laws will have any impact on its ability to obtain dividends from the Bank.

 The Company also is subject to regulatory restrictions on payment of dividends to its shareholders. Regulators have indicated that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only if the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Further, a bank holding company should inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board prior to declaring a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization’s capital structure.
  
 Capital Requirements. Effective January 1, 2015, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) adopted a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The final rule implemented the "Basel III" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (see definition below). The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and refines the definition of what constitutes "capital" for purposes of calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements currently applicable to the Bank are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective on January 1, 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (b) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (c) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities.
  
 The CETI and Tier 1 leverage ratio of the Bank as of December 31, 2018, were 13.65% and 11.79%, respectively, which are significantly above the minimum requirements. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
  
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the proposed framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing-in through January 1, 2027. Under the current capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulatory agencies.
  
 As directed by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), on November 21, 2018, the federal banking regulators jointly issued a proposed rule that would permit qualifying banks that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets to elect to be subject to a 9% “community bank leverage ratio.” A qualifying bank that has chosen the proposed framework would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements and would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” under prompt corrective action rules, provided it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. This proposed rule has not been finalized and, as a result, the content and scope of any final rule, and its impact on the Bank (if any), cannot be determined at this time.
  
 Pursuant to the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion, such as the Company, are not subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements.

 Source of Strength. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
  
 Safety and Soundness. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance fund in the event of a depository institution default. For example, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become "undercapitalized" with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution's total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines.
  
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”) allows a bank holding company or other company to certify status as a financial holding company, which will allow such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker;dealing in or making markets in securities; and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto.
  
 USA Patriot Act of 2001. In October 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Northern Virginia which occurred on September 11, 2001. The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcements’ and the intelligence communities’ abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The continuing and potential impact of the Patriot Act and related regulations and policies on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.
  
 Community Reinvestment Act.  The requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act are also applicable to the Bank. The act imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution’s efforts in meeting community needs currently are evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to twelve assessment factors. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility.

 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Its wide-ranging provisions affect all federal financial regulatory agencies and nearly every aspect of the American financial services industry. Among the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that directly impact the Company is the creation of an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has the ability to implement, examine and enforce complaints with federal consumer protection laws, which govern all financial institutions. For smaller financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, their primary regulators will continue to conduct its examination activities.
  
 The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions designed to reform mortgage lending, which includes the requirement of additional disclosures for consumer mortgages. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued new rules that have the effect of limiting the fees charged to merchants for debit card transactions. The result of these rules will be to limit the amount of interchange fee income available explicitly to larger banks and indirectly to us. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation.
  
 Although the Dodd-Frank Act provisions themselves are extensive, the ultimate impact on the Company of this massive legislation is unknown. The Act provides that several federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, shall issue regulations implementing major portions of the legislation, and this process is ongoing.
  
 In May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was enacted to modify or remove certain regulatory financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank, and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion.
  
 Among other matters, the Economic Growth Act expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, exempts community banks from the Volcker Rule, and includes additional regulatory relief regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
  
 It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Economic Growth Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Economic Growth Act and implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.
