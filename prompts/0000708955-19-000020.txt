Item 1.  Business.
First Financial Bancorp.
First Financial Bancorp., an Ohio corporation (First Financial or the Company), was formed in 1982.  First Financial is a mid-sized, regional bank holding company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, which has elected to become a financial holding company. References in this Form 10-K to “we,” “us” or “our” refer, as the context requires, to First Financial and its subsidiaries, collectively or to First Financial as the holding company.
First Financial engages in the business of commercial banking and other banking and banking-related activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, First Financial Bank (the Bank), which was founded in 1863. Effective December 30, 2016, the Bank converted its charter to an Ohio state chartered bank from a nationally chartered bank.
The range of banking services provided by First Financial to individuals and businesses includes commercial lending, real estate lending and consumer financing.  Real estate loans are loans secured by a mortgage lien on the real property of the borrower, which may either be residential property (one to four family residential housing units) or commercial property (owner-occupied and/or investor income producing real estate, such as apartments, shopping centers, or office buildings).  Risk of loss related to lending activities is managed by adherence to standard loan policies that establish certain levels of performance prior to the extension of a loan to the borrower.  In addition, First Financial offers deposit products that include interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing accounts, time deposits and cash management services for commercial customers. A full range of trust and wealth management services is also provided through First Financial’s Wealth Management line of business.
Commercial and industrial loans are made to all types of businesses for a variety of purposes including, but not limited to, inventory, receivables and equipment.  First Financial works with businesses to meet their shorter term working capital needs while also providing long-term financing for their business plans.  First Financial also offers lease and equipment financing through a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, First Financial Equipment Finance LLC (First Equipment Finance).  Credit risk for lending activities is managed through standardized loan policies, established and authorized credit limits, centralized portfolio management and the diversification of market area and industries.  The overall strength of the borrower is evaluated through the credit underwriting process and includes a variety of analytical activities, including the review of historical and projected cash flows, financial performance, financial strength of the principals and guarantors and collateral values, where applicable.
Commercial and industrial lending activities also include equipment and leasehold improvement financing for franchisees throughout the U.S., principally in the quick service and casual dining sector.  The underwriting of these loans incorporates basic credit proficiencies combined with knowledge of select franchise concepts to measure the creditworthiness of proposed multi-unit borrowers.  The focus is on a limited number of concepts that we believe have sound economics, lower closure rates, and higher brand awareness within specified local, regional or national markets.  Loan terms for equipment are generally up to 84 months fully amortizing and up to 180 months on real estate-related requests.
First Financial also offers secured commercial financing throughout the U.S. through two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Bank, Oak Street Funding LLC (Oak Street) and First Franchise Capital Corporation (First Franchise). Oak Street lends to the insurance industry, registered investment advisors, certified public accountants and indirect auto finance companies, while First Franchise lends to restaurant franchisees. Together, these niche lending activities are driven by acquisitions, ownership transitions and financing general working capital needs.  The underwriting of Oak Street's loans involves analyses of collateral (through use of Oak Street’s proprietary system) that consists of revenue, which is then continuously monitored by Oak Street throughout the life of the loans.
Commercial real estate loans are secured by a mortgage lien on the real property.  The credit underwriting for both owner-occupied and investor income producing real estate loans includes detailed market analysis, historical and projected cash flow analysis, appropriate equity margins, assessment of lessees and lessors, type of real estate and other analyses.  Market diversification within First Financial’s service area and industry diversification are other means by which First Financial manages the risk.  First Financial does not have a significant exposure to residential builders and developers.
The majority of residential real estate loans originated by the Bank conform to secondary market underwriting standards and are sold within a short timeframe to unaffiliated third parties. The Bank sells the loans with both servicing retained and servicing released, depending on pricing and other market conditions.  The credit underwriting standards adhere to a required

TABLE OF CONTENTS

level of documentation, verifications, valuation and overall credit performance of the borrower.  The underwriting of these loans includes an evaluation of these and other pertinent factors prior to the extension of credit. These underwriting standards increase the marketability and address the credit risk associated with the loans.
Consumer loans are primarily loans made to individuals.  These types of loans include new and used vehicle loans, second mortgages on residential real estate and unsecured loans.  Risk elements in the consumer loan portfolio are primarily focused on the borrower’s cash flow and credit history, which are key indicators of the ability to repay.  A level of security is provided through liens on automobile titles and second mortgage liens, where applicable.  Consumer loans are generally smaller dollar amounts than other types of lending and are made to a large number of customers, increasing diversification within the portfolio.  Economic conditions that affect consumers in First Financial’s markets have a direct impact on the credit quality of these loans.  Higher levels of unemployment, lower levels of income growth and weaker economic growth are factors that may adversely impact consumer loan credit quality.
Home equity lines of credit consist mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by residential real estate.  Home equity lines of credit are generally governed by the same lending policies and subject to the same credit risk as described previously for residential real estate loans.
First Financial has a limited number of foreign currency transactions and, in general, does not have significant exposure to loss from foreign currencies. Foreign currency activities are generally related to services provided to commercial customers.

Market and Competitive Information
First Financial utilizes a community banking business model and serves a combination of metropolitan and non-metropolitan markets through its full-service banking centers primarily in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois.  Market selection is based upon a number of factors, but markets are primarily chosen for their potential for growth, long-term profitability and customer reach.  First Financial’s goal is to develop a competitive advantage through a local market focus, building long-term relationships with clients to help them reach greater levels of financial success.
We also compete on a nationwide basis through Oak Street which lends to the insurance industry, registered investment advisors, certified public accountants and indirect auto finance companies and First Franchise which lends to restaurants franchisees.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Company’s markets support many different types of business activities, such as manufacturing, agriculture, education, healthcare and professional services.  Within these markets, growth is projected to continue in key demographic groups and populations.  First Financial’s market evaluation includes demographic measures such as income levels, median household income and population growth.  The Midwestern markets that First Financial serves have historically not experienced the level of economic volatility experienced in other areas of the country, although material fluctuations may occur.  
First Financial believes that it is well positioned to compete in its markets.  Smaller than super-regional and multi-national bank holding companies, First Financial believes that it can meet the needs of its markets through a local decision-making process and that it is better positioned to compete for business than smaller community banks that may have size or geographic limitations.  First Financial’s targeted customers include individuals and small to medium sized businesses within the Bank's geographic footprint. Through its diversified delivery systems of banking centers, ATMs, internet banking and telephone-based transactions, First Financial is able to meet the needs of its customers in an ever-changing marketplace.
First Financial faces strong competition from financial institutions and other non-financial organizations.  Its competitors include local and regional financial institutions, savings and loans and bank holding companies, as well as some of the largest banking organizations in the United States.  In addition, other types of financial institutions, such as credit unions, offer a wide range of loan and deposit services that are competitive with those offered by First Financial. The consumer is also served by brokerage firms and mutual funds that provide checking services, credit cards, margin loans and other services similar to those offered by First Financial.  Online lenders also create additional competition, particularly in the mortgage and consumer lending areas. Major consumer retail stores compete for loans by offering credit cards and retail installment contracts.  It is anticipated that competition from other financial and non-financial services entities will continue and, for certain products and services, intensify.
Supervision and Regulation
First Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to an extensive system of laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), and the banking system in general and not for the protection of shareholders.  These laws and regulations govern such areas as capital, permissible activities, allowance for loan and lease losses, loans and investments, interest rates that can be charged on loans and consumer protection communications and disclosures.  Certain elements of selected laws and regulations are described in more detail in the sections that follow.  These descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
We are subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA) and subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board.  The BHCA requires prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board of the acquisition of 5% or more of the voting stock or substantially all the assets of any bank within the United States.  In addition, First Financial’s acquisition of a savings and loan association would require Federal Reserve Board approval. Acquisitions are also subject to certain anti-competitive limitations.
The BHCA and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board prohibit a bank holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property, or furnishing of services.  A tie-in arrangement is when a bank uses its ability to offer banking products in a coercive manner to gain a competitive advantage for non-banking products or services. The BHCA also imposes certain restrictions upon dealings by affiliated banks with the holding company and among themselves, including restrictions on inter-bank borrowing and upon dealings in the securities or obligations of the holding company or other affiliates.
The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil monetary penalties, issue cease and desist or removal orders, and require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including a subsidiary bank). In general, the Federal Reserve Board may initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. A bank holding company is required by law and Federal Reserve Board policy to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to its shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

With some exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve non-bank activities that, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, are held to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. A bank holding company that elects to be a financial holding company may, however, engage in additional non-bank activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature.
Activities that are considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be “financial in nature” include:
•securities underwriting, dealing and market making;
•sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies;
•insurance underwriting and agency;
•merchant banking; and
•activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking.
A financial holding company must be well-capitalized and well-managed, and each subsidiary bank must be well-capitalized and well-managed and have a CRA rating of at least satisfactory. If a financial holding company or a subsidiary bank fails to meet all requirements for the holding company to maintain financial holding company status, material restrictions may be placed on the activities of the holding company and on the ability of the holding company to enter into certain transactions or obtain regulatory approvals. The holding company could also lose its financial holding company status and be required to divest ownership or control of all banks owned by the financial holding company. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of a financial holding company, such restrictions may not be made publicly available pursuant to confidentiality regulations of the banking regulators.
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the "Regulatory Relief Act") was signed into law. The Regulatory Relief Act was designed to provide regulatory relief for banking organizations, particularly for all but the very largest, those with assets in excess of $250 billion. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, and those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be relieved of those requirements in 18 months, unless the Federal Reserve Board takes action to maintain those standards. Certain regulatory requirements applied only to banks with assets in excess of $50 billion and so did not apply to the Company even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act.
The Regulatory Relief Act also provides that the banking regulators must adopt regulations implementing the provision that banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are permitted to satisfy capital standards and be considered "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action framework if their leverage ratios of tangible assets to average consolidated assets is between 8% and 10%, unless the banking organization's federal banking agency determines that the banking organization's risk profile warrants a more stringent leverage ratio. The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have proposed for comment the leverage ratio framework for any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, limited amounts of certain types of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The community bank leverage ratio would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average total consolidated assets. Tangible equity capital would be defined as total bank equity capital or total holding company equity capital, as applicable, prior to including minority interests, and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets). Average total assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the community bank leverage ratio numerator would also be excluded from the community bank leverage ratio denominator.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also adopted a rule providing banking organizations with the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with assets of less than $100 billion in assets from certain record-keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Depository Institution Regulation
The Bank, as a bank chartered under the laws of the State of Ohio and a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (Federal Reserve Bank), is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (ODFI). The Bank's deposits are insured up to the legal limits by the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC and is subject to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA). The Bank is also subject to regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and has broad powers to adopt and enforce consumer protection regulations.
Regulatory Capital
Financial institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain capital as a way of absorbing losses that can and cannot be predicted. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies as well as state banks that are members of a Federal Reserve Bank. The OCC and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for national banks and state non-member banks, respectively. The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of prompt corrective action regulatory provisions. 
In July 2013, the United States banking regulators issued new capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations, which First Financial was at the time. These capital rules implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the Basel III Capital Rules). Community banking organizations, including First Financial and the Bank, began transitioning to the new rules when the new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015. A capital conservation buffer (i.e. common equity) and additional deductions from common equity capital were phased in through January 1, 2019.
The capital rules include (a) a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, (b) a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0%, (c) a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0% and (d) a minimum leverage ratio (tier 1 capital to average assets) of 4.0%.
Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions.
Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions.
Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions.
The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization’s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels).
The rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the Company does not hold a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5% composed of common equity tier 1 capital compared to its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effective January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer requirement phases were fully phased in. 
Federal banking regulators have established regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve capital deficient banks. Under these regulations, institutions that become undercapitalized become subject to mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations, which increase as capital continues to decrease. Each such institution is also required to file a capital plan with its primary federal regulator, and its holding company must guarantee the capital shortfall up to 5% of the assets of the capital deficient institution at the time it becomes undercapitalized.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In accordance with the Basel III Capital Rules, in order to be “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action guidelines, a bank must have a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level or any capital measure. At December 31, 2018, the Bank met the capital ratio requirements to be deemed “well-capitalized” according to the guidelines previously described.
A bank with a capital level that might qualify for well capitalized or adequately capitalized status may nevertheless be treated as though the bank is in the next lower capital category if the bank’s primary federal banking supervisory authority determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants that treatment. A bank’s operations can be significantly affected by its capital classification under the prompt corrective action rules. For example, a bank that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market without advance regulatory approval. These deposit-funding limitations can have an adverse effect on the bank’s liquidity. At each successively lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to additional restrictions. Undercapitalized banks are required to take specified actions to increase their capital or otherwise decrease the risks to the federal deposit insurance fund. Bank regulatory agencies generally are required to appoint a receiver or conservator within 90 days after a bank becomes critically undercapitalized with a leverage ratio of less than 2%. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that a federal bank regulatory authority may require a bank holding company to divest itself of an undercapitalized bank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture will improve the bank’s financial condition and prospects.
In September 2017, the Federal Reserve Board, along with other bank regulatory agencies, proposed amendments to its capital requirements to simplify various aspects of the capital rules and thereby reduce regulatory burden for “non-advanced approaches” banking organizations. The Bank is a non-advanced approach bank because it has total consolidated assets less than $250 billion and balance sheet foreign exposures of less than the maximum amount for a non-advanced approach bank. Because the amendments were proposed with a request for comments and have not been finalized, we do not yet know what effect the final rules will have on the Bank’s capital calculations. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies extended, for such non-advanced approaches banks, the existing capital requirements for certain items that were scheduled to change effective January 1, 2018, in light of the simplification amendments being considered. 
Debit Card Interchange Fees
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions be “reasonable” and proportional to certain costs related to processing the transactions. The Federal Reserve Board established certain standards and prohibitions, including setting interchange fees and allowing for an upward adjustment if the debit card issuer implements policies and procedures designed to prevent fraud. The debit card interchange rules became applicable to First Financial after First Financial’s assets exceeded $10 billion. First Financial expects noninterest income to decline by approximately $13.0 million on an annual basis as a result of the Durbin Amendment, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, with the first full year impact in 2020.
Limitations on Dividends and Other Payments
There are various legal limitations on the extent to which a subsidiary bank may finance or otherwise supply funds to its parent holding company. Under applicable federal and state laws, the Bank may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, First Financial. A subsidiary bank is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loan or extension of credit permitted by such exceptions. 
The Bank may not pay dividends out of its surplus if, after paying these dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum capital levels established by the Federal Reserve Board. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank is also restricted if the Bank does not hold a capital conservation buffer as described above. In addition, the Bank must have the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the ODFI if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of the Bank’s current year’s net income and the retained net income for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus. Under Ohio law, the Bank may pay a dividend from surplus only with the approval of First Financial (as the sole shareholder of the Bank) and the approval of the ODFI. Payment of dividends by the Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its regulatory authorities, if such regulatory authorities deem such dividends to constitute unsafe and/or unsound banking practices or if necessary to maintain adequate capital.
The ability of First Financial to obtain funds for the payment of dividends, for the servicing of indebtedness and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by the Bank. However, because the Federal Reserve Board expects us to serve as a source of strength to the Bank, as discussed above, payment of dividends by the Bank

TABLE OF CONTENTS

may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board if the Federal Reserve Board deems such dividends to constitute an unsafe and/or unsound banking practice.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a bank holding company generally should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. Under certain circumstances, a bank holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board of an intended dividend payment, to which the Federal Reserve Board might object if it determines the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice. 
Insurance of Accounts
The FDIC maintains the DIF, which insures the deposit accounts of the Bank to the maximum amount provided by law.  The general insurance limit is $250,000 per separately insured depositor.  This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on each insured institution quarterly based on risk characteristics of the institution. As a bank with assets of more than $10 billion, First Financial is subject to a deposit assessment based on a scorecard issued by the FDIC. This scorecard considers, among other things, the Bank’s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as our use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the results of the Bank’s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 1.5 and 40 basis points. The FDIC may also impose a special assessment in an emergency situation.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), which is the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits of the total industry. In March 2016, the FDIC adopted final rules designed to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%.  The FDIC’s rules reduced assessment rates on all banks but imposed a surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more until the DRR reaches 1.35% and will provide assessment credits to banks with assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%. The rules also changed the method to determine risk-based assessment rates for established banks with less than $10 billion in assets to better ensure that banks taking on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than less risky banks. The reserve ratio reached 1.36% on September 30, 2018, and as a result the surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more will cease with the first assessment invoice in 2019. In addition, once the DRR reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will apply the assessment credits to banks that had assets below $10 billion at any time during the credit calculation period, which includes the Bank. The Bank will also be entitled to assessment credits attributable to MainSource.
In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF.  These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September 2019. The Financing Corporation has projected that the last assessment will be collected on the March 2019, FDIC invoice.
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by DIF-insured institutions. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
Banks are subject to regular examination to ensure compliance with federal statutes and regulations applicable to their business, including consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations. Potential penalties under these laws include, but are not limited to, fines. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. As a bank with total assets in excess of $10 billion, the Bank is primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB has adopted numerous rules with respect to consumer protection laws, amending some existing regulations and adopting new ones, and has commenced enforcement actions. The following are just some of the consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank:

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | Community Reinvestment Act of 1977: imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation to fulfill the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. 


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act: prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction on the basis of any of various criteria. 


• | Truth in Lending Act: requires that credit terms are disclosed in a manner that permits a consumer to understand and compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. 


• | Fair Housing Act: makes it unlawful for a lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person on the basis of any of certain criteria. 


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act: requires financial institutions to collect data that enables regulatory agencies to determine whether the financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the communities in which they are located. 


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act: requires that lenders provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits abusive practices that increase borrowers’ costs. 


• | Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: requires financial institutions to establish policies and procedures to restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties and to protect customer information from unauthorized access. 

The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of specific banking or consumer finance law. 
In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule, referred to as the “Payday Rule,” that addresses commercial lending practices with respect to certain consumer loans. The Payday Rule was effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most of its provisions will not be required until August 19, 2019. The first major part of the rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. The second major part of the rule applies to the same types of loans as well as longer-term loans with an annual percentage rate greater than 36% that are repaid directly from the borrower’s account. The rule states that it is an unfair and abusive practice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrower’s account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer’s new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account. The rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment from the borrower’s account. 
On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule. First, the CFPB proposed to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Payday Rule to November 19, 2020. It has requested comments on the proposed delay to be made within 30 days. Second, the CFPB proposed to rescind provisions of the Payday Rule that (1) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms; (2) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (3) provide exemptions of certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (4) provide related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The CFPB has requested comments to be made within 90 days on this proposal. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule. The CFPB also stated that it will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives.
The Company does not currently expect the new Payday Rules to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 
Community Reinvestment Act
Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), every FDIC-insured institution is obligated, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking regulator, in connection with the examination of an insured institution, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to consider this record in its evaluation of

certain applications to banking regulators, such as an application for approval of a merger or the establishment of a branch.  An unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application and will prevent a bank holding company of the institution from making an election to become a financial holding company. As of its last examination, the Bank received a CRA rating of “satisfactory.”
Privacy Rules
Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties.  The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties.  The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
Fiscal and Monetary Policies
The earnings of banks, and, therefore, the earnings of First Financial (and its subsidiaries), are affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the United States government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board.  An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in an effort to prevent recession and to restrain inflation.  Among the procedures used to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on member bank deposits. These policies are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.
Volcker Rule
In December 2013, five federal agencies adopted a final regulation implementing the so-called Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act (the Volcker Rule). The Volcker Rule places limits on the trading activity of insured depository institutions and entities affiliated with a depository institution, subject to certain exceptions. The trading activity includes a purchase or sale as principal of a security or a derivative, commodity future or option on a security in order to benefit from short-term price movements or to realize short-term profits. The Volcker Rule exempts specified U.S. government, agency and/or municipal obligations, and it excludes trading conducted in certain capacities, including as a broker or other agent, through a deferred compensation or pension plan, as a fiduciary on behalf of customers, to satisfy a debt previously contracted, repurchase and securities lending agreements and risk-mitigating hedging activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits a banking entity from having an ownership interest in, or certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund, with a number of various exceptions. The Bank from time to time may engage in trading activities or own the types of funds regulated by the Volcker Rule.
Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Board Regulation W generally:

• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate;


• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with all affiliates; and


• | require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate. 

An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate, and other similar types of transactions.
A bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms (including interest rates charged and collateral required) substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank’s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts.

Executive and Incentive Compensation
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (the Joint Guidance) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should: (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. The Joint Guidance made incentive compensation part of the regulatory agencies’ examination process, with the findings of the supervisory initiatives included in reports of examination and enforcement actions possible.
In May 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved a joint notice of proposed rules (the Proposed Joint Rules) designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at financial institutions. The Proposed Joint Rules apply to covered financial institutions with total assets of $1 billion or more. For all covered institutions, including Level 3 institutions like us, the proposed rule:

• | prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that are “excessive” or “could lead to material financial loss;”


• | requires incentive based compensation that is consistent with a balance of risk and reward, effective management and control of risk and effective governance; and


• | requires board oversight, recordkeeping and disclosure to the appropriate regulatory agency.

Further, as stock exchanges impose additional listing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, public companies are required to implement “clawback” procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures, which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards.
Patriot Act
In response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) was signed into law in October 2001. The Patriot Act gives the United States government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions. Among other requirements, Title III and related regulations require regulated financial institutions to establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity. The Bank has established policies and procedures that it considers to be in compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.
State Law
As an Ohio-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regular examination by the ODFI. State banking regulation affects the Bank’s internal organization and corporate governance, capital distributions, activities, acquisitions of other institutions and branching. State banking regulation may contain limitations on an institution’s activities that are in addition to limitations imposed under federal banking law. The ODFI may initiate supervisory measures or formal enforcement actions, and under certain circumstances, it may take control of an Ohio-chartered bank.
In 2017, the State of Ohio completed a substantial re-writing of Ohio’s banking laws that became effective on January 1, 2018. One of the primary purposes of the revision of the law was to adopt one universal bank charter for depository institutions chartered by the state, rather than having separate types of state depository institution charters with different powers and limitations for banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations. The result is that all Ohio-chartered depository institutions are now considered to have full commercial bank powers, unless an institution elects to continue to be governed by federal restrictions applicable to federal savings and loan associations and federal savings banks. While the most substantial changes in the law affect institutions chartered by Ohio as savings banks or savings and loan associations prior to the effectiveness of the new law, some changes also apply to institutions, like the Bank, that were chartered as commercial banks

prior to the change in the law. The changes for all Ohio-chartered banks include provisions allowing Ohio-chartered banks to exercise the same powers, perform all acts, and provide all services that are permitted for federally chartered depository institutions, with the exception of laws and regulations dealing with interest rates, thereby enhancing opportunities for Ohio-chartered banks to compete with other financial institutions. Other provisions clarify previous laws addressing, or allow more flexibility with respect to, corporate governance matters, mergers and acquisitions and additional reliance on Ohio corporate law generally. 
In addition, in October 2017, Ohio-chartered banks received notices of required assessments to be paid to the ODFI.  For two years, the ODFI was funded by State of Ohio excess unclaimed funds allocated to the ODFI by the State of Ohio.  That funding source has ceased to be available, and assessments are once again required.
