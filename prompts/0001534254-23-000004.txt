Item 1. Business
Overview
CĪON Investment Corporation, or the Company, was incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on August 9, 2011. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, the term “portfolio companies” refers to companies in which we have invested, either directly or indirectly through our consolidated subsidiaries.

We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC, as defined under Subchapter M of the Code.

We are managed by CIM, our affiliate and a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with us, CIM oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions for our portfolio. CIM is a controlled and consolidated subsidiary of CION Investment Group, LLC, or CIG, our affiliate. As a member of CIM, CIG’s investment professionals provide investment advisory services, including advice, evaluation and recommendations with respect to our investments. Additionally, Apollo Investment Management, L.P., or AIM, a subsidiary of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE: APO), or Apollo, also a member of CIM and a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act, performs certain services for CIM, which include, among other services, providing (a) trade and settlement support; (b) portfolio and cash reconciliation; (c) market pipeline information regarding syndicated deals, in each case, as reasonably requested by CIM; and (d) monthly valuation reports and support for all broker-quoted investments. AIM may also, from time to time, provide us with access to potential investment opportunities made available on Apollo’s credit platform on a similar basis as other third-party market participants. All of our investment decisions are the sole responsibility of, and are made at the sole discretion of, CIM’s investment committee, which consists entirely of CIG senior personnel.
Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation for investors. We seek to meet our investment objective by utilizing the experienced management team of CIM, which includes its access to the relationships and human capital of its affiliates in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, as well as monitoring and servicing our investments. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, unsecured debt, and equity, of private and thinly-traded U.S. middle-market companies. See “Item 1. Business – Investment Types” below for a detailed description of the types of investments that may comprise our portfolio.  We define middle-market companies as companies that generally possess annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $75 million or less, with experienced management teams, significant free cash flow, strong competitive positions and potential for growth.

In addition, we may from time to time invest up to 30% of our assets opportunistically in other types of investments, including collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities and the securities of larger public companies and foreign securities, which may be deemed “non-qualifying assets” for the purpose of complying with investment restrictions under the 1940 Act. See “Item 1. Business - Qualifying Assets” below.
In connection with our debt investments, we may receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We may also purchase equity interests in the form of common or preferred stock in our target companies, either in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor. We expect that our investments will generally range between $5 million and $50 million each, although investments may vary as the size of our capital base changes and will ultimately be at the discretion of CIM, subject to oversight by our board of directors. We have made and intend to make smaller investments in syndicated loan opportunities, which typically include investments in companies with annual EBITDA of greater than $75 million, subject to liquidity and diversification constraints.

To enhance our opportunity for gain, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM. On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum “asset coverage” ratio from 200% to 150% and, as a result, to potentially increase the ratio of a BDC's debt to equity from a maximum of 1-to-1 to a maximum of 2-to-1, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. At our Special Meeting of Shareholders on December 30, 2021, shareholders approved a proposal to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150%, which allows us to increase the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur. Such asset coverage ratio became effective on December 31, 2021. We are required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in negotiating or investing in certain investments with entities with which we may be prohibited from doing so under the 1940 Act, such as CIM and its affiliates, unless we obtain an exemptive order from the SEC. On August 30, 2022, we, CIM and certain of our affiliates were granted an order for exemptive relief, or the Order, by the SEC for us to co-invest with other funds managed by CIM or certain affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit CIM or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Order permits us to co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds, even if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. Even though we were granted the Order by the SEC, CIM’s investment committee may determine that we should not participate in a co-investment transaction.

Our Common Stock and the NYSE Listing

On December 17, 2012, we met our minimum offering requirement of $2,500 in capital raised from persons not affiliated with us, admitted our initial public investors as shareholders and officially commenced operations. Our initial continuous public offering ended on December 31, 2015, and our follow-on continuous public offering commenced on January 25, 2016 and ended on January 25, 2019, the date on which we closed the public offering of our shares. On October 5, 2021, our shares of common stock commenced trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “CION”, or the Listing. Since commencing our initial continuous public offering on July 2, 2012 and through December 31, 2022, we sold 55,299,484 shares of common stock for corresponding net proceeds of $1,144,863 at an average price per share of $20.70. The net proceeds include gross proceeds received from reinvested shareholder distributions of $237,451 pursuant to our pre-Listing distribution reinvestment plan, for which we issued 13,523,489 shares of common stock, and gross proceeds paid for shares of common stock repurchased of $247,874, for which we repurchased 14,969,883 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, 14,969,883 shares of common stock repurchased had been retired. For a complete description of our pre-Listing distribution reinvestment plan and pre-Listing and post-Listing share repurchase programs, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in this report.
On February 26, 2023, our shares of common stock also listed and commenced trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd., or the TASE, under the ticker symbol “CION”.
Distributions

In January 2013, we began authorizing monthly distributions to our shareholders. From February 1, 2014 through July 17, 2017, our board of directors authorized and declared on a monthly basis a weekly distribution amount per share of our common stock.  On July 18, 2017, our board of directors authorized and declared on a quarterly basis a weekly distribution amount per share of our common stock. Effective September 28, 2017, our board of directors delegated to management the authority to determine the amount, record dates, payment dates and other terms of distributions to shareholders, which are ratified by our board of directors, each on a quarterly basis. Beginning on March 19, 2020, we changed the timing of declaring distributions from quarterly to monthly and temporarily suspended the payment of distributions to shareholders commencing with the month ended April 30, 2020. On July 15, 2020, our board of directors determined to recommence the payment of distributions to shareholders in August 2020. On September 15, 2021, we changed the timing of declaring and paying regular distributions to shareholders from monthly to quarterly commencing with the fourth quarter of 2021. Distributions in respect of future quarters and any special distributions will be evaluated by management and the board of directors based on circumstances and expectations existing at the time of consideration. Declared distributions are paid quarterly.
Our board of directors declared or ratified distributions for 5, 11 and 19 record dates during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table presents distributions per share that were declared during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:

Market Opportunity

We believe that the market for lending to private U.S. middle-market companies continues to present a compelling investment opportunity. CIM’s management team has witnessed significant demand for debt capital among middle-market companies that have the characteristics we target. We believe that this demand, coupled with the fragmented availability of funding within our target market, will continue to enable us to achieve favorable transaction pricing. We believe that the following characteristics and market trends support our belief:

•The middle-market is a large addressable market. According to the National Center for the Middle Market Year-End 2022 Middle Market Indicator, there are approximately 200,000 U.S. middle-market companies employing approximately 48 million people. The U.S. middle-market accounts for approximately one-third of private sector gross domestic product, or GDP, which, measured on a global scale, would be the fifth largest global economy. Collectively, the U.S. middle market generates more than $10 trillion in annual revenue. The National Center for the Middle Market defines middle-market companies as those with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, which we believe has significant overlap with our definition of middle-market companies that generally possess EBITDA of $75 million or less.
•There have been secular changes in ownership structures of U.S. middle-market companies. We believe that there has been a transformation in the ownership structures of private and public companies. The number of U.S. private-equity companies is at its highest level since 2000. Conversely, the number of listed U.S. domestic companies has dramatically declined over the same period, yet the average market capitalization of listed U.S. companies has grown. As a result, we believe that there has been a shift in the ownership of U.S. middle-market companies and thus creating a larger market opportunity for us to provide debt capital to the companies that we target.
•Changes in business strategy by banks have further reduced the supply of capital to U.S. middle-market companies. The trend of consolidation of regional banks into money center banks has reduced the focus of these businesses on middle-market lending. Money center banks traditionally focus on lending and providing other services to large corporate clients to whom they can deploy larger amounts of capital more efficiently. We believe that this has resulted in fewer bank lenders to U.S. middle-market companies and reduced the availability of debt capital to the companies that we expect to target. As a result, we believe there is an increasing trend for middle-market companies to seek financing from other sources, such as us.
•It is difficult for new direct lending platforms to enter the middle market and fill the capital void because it is very fragmented. While the middle market is a very large component of the U.S. economy, it is a highly fragmented space with thousands of companies operating in many different geographies and industries. Typically, companies that need capital find lenders and investors based on pre-existing relationships, referrals and word of mouth. Developing the many relationships and wide-spread recognition required to become source of capital to the middle market is a time consuming, highly resource-intensive endeavor. As a result, we believe that it is difficult for new lending platforms to successfully enter the middle market, thereby providing insulation from rapid shifts in the supply of capital to the middle market that might otherwise disrupt pricing of capital.
•There is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional senior debt capital to finance strategic transactions. We expect that middle-market private equity firms will continue to invest the approximately $1.1 trillion raised since 2012 in middle-market companies, as reported in Pitchbook’s 3Q 2022 U.S. PE Middle Market Report, and that these private equity firms will seek to support their investments with senior loans from other sources, such as us.
•Specialized lending and unfunded private equity commitments drive demand for debt capital.  Lending to small- and middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, structuring experience and active portfolio management. In addition, middle-market companies may require more active monitoring and participation on the lender’s part. As such, we believe that, of the U.S. financial institutions that are not liquidity constrained, few are capable of pursuing a sustained lending strategy successfully. We believe this creates a significant supply/demand imbalance for small and middle-market credit. We also expect that private equity firms will continue to pursue acquisitions and will seek to leverage their equity investments with debt financing, including senior debt, unitranche debt, and mezzanine loans provided by companies such as ours. Historically, according to the S&P LCD Leveraged Lending Review, such leverage has represented approximately 70% of a private equity acquisition. Therefore, adding to the imbalance in the availability of credit is the significant amount of unallocated private equity capital raised since 2012 described above, much of which will require debt financing in the coming years. As depicted in the chart below, almost $1.24 trillion of unfunded private equity commitments were outstanding through the third quarter of 2022 (Source: Pitchbook's Q3 2022 Global Private Market Fundraising Report).
U.S. PE Capital Overhang ($B) by Year

* As of 9/30/2022
•Active private equity focus on small- and middle-market firms.  Private equity firms have continued their active roles investing in small- and middle-market companies, and CIM expects this trend to continue. Private equity funds often seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured and mezzanine loans from other sources. Thus, we believe that significant private equity investment in middle-market firms will create substantial investment opportunities for us to fill the role of leverage provider. We believe that the network of relationships between CIM’s senior management team and the private equity community will be a key channel through which we will seek to access significant investment opportunities.
•Attractive market segment.  We believe that the underserved nature of such a large segment of the market can at times create a significant opportunity for investment. In particular, we believe that middle-market companies are more likely to offer attractive economics in terms of transaction pricing (including higher debt yields), upfront and ongoing fees, prepayment penalties and more attractive security features in the form of stricter covenants and quality collateral. In addition, as compared to larger companies, middle-market companies often have simpler capital structures and carry less leverage, thus aiding the structuring and negotiation process and allowing us greater flexibility in structuring favorable transactions.

Characteristics of and Risks Related to Investments in Private Companies

We have invested and continue to invest primarily in the debt of privately held companies. Investments in private companies pose significantly greater risks as compared to investments in public companies. First, private companies have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress. Second, the investments themselves are often illiquid. As such, we may have difficulty exiting an investment promptly or at a desired price prior to maturity or outside of a normal amortization schedule. In addition, little public information generally exists about private companies. Finally, these companies often do not have third-party debt ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of CIM to obtain adequate information through its due diligence efforts to evaluate the creditworthiness of, and risks involved with, investing in these companies. These companies and their financial information will also generally not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and other rules and regulations that govern public companies that are designed to protect investors.
Investment Strategy

When evaluating an investment, we use the resources of CIM to develop an investment thesis and a proprietary view of a potential company’s value. When identifying prospective portfolio companies, we focus primarily on the following attributes, which we believe will help us generate higher total returns with an acceptable level of risk. These attributes are:

•Leading, defensible market positions that present attractive growth opportunities.  We seek to invest in companies that we believe possess advantages in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality versus their competitors, minimizing sales risk and protecting profitability.
•Companies with leading market positions and strong free cash flows.  We seek to invest in the debt of companies that have a leading market position or other significant competitive advantages and significant free cash flow. We believe that such companies are able to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay our loans and maintain growth or market share.
•Investing in middle-market, private companies.  We seek to invest in middle-market, private companies that generally possess annual EBITDA of $75 million or less at the time of investment. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies, turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans.
•Proven management teams with meaningful equity ownership.  We focus on investments in which the target company has an experienced management team with an established track record of success. We typically require the portfolio companies to have in place proper incentives to align management’s goals with ours. Generally, we focus on companies in which the management teams have significant equity interests.
•Private equity sponsorship.  Often we seek to participate in transactions sponsored by what we believe to be high-quality private equity firms. CIM’s management team believes that a private equity sponsor’s willingness to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company provides an additional level of due diligence investigation and is an implicit endorsement of the quality of the investment. Further, by co-investing with quality private equity firms that commit significant sums of equity capital with junior priority to our debt investments, we may benefit from having due diligence on our investments performed by both parties. Further, strong private equity sponsors with significant investments at risk have the ability and a strong incentive to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should operational or financial issues arise.
•Broad portfolio.  We seek to create a portfolio of companies engaged in a variety of industries and located in a variety of geographic locations, thereby potentially reducing the risk of a downturn in any one industry, including, without limitation, as a result of COVID-19, inflation, rising interest rates, supply-chain disruptions, the risk of recession, or geographic location having a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio. We are not a “diversified company” as such term is defined under the 1940 Act. Because we are a BDC, we focus on and invest at least 70% of our total assets in U.S. companies, but seek to maintain investments across the various geographic regions of the U.S. To the extent that we invest in foreign companies, we intend to do so in accordance with the limitations under the 1940 Act and only in jurisdictions with established legal frameworks and a history of respecting creditor rights, including the United Kingdom and countries that are members of the European Union, as well as Canada, Australia and Japan. We cannot assure investors that we will be successful in our efforts to maintain a broad portfolio of investments.
•Viable exit strategy.  We focus our investment activity primarily in companies whose business models and growth prospects offer attractive exit possibilities, including repayment of our investments, with the potential for capital gain on any equity interest we hold through an initial public offering of common stock, a merger, a sale or other recapitalization.

Moreover, we may acquire investments in the secondary loan market, and, in analyzing such investments, we will employ the same analytical process that we use for our primary investments.
Potential Competitive Advantages

We believe that we offer to our investors the following potential competitive advantages over other capital providers to private U.S. middle-market companies:

•Proven ability to invest in middle-market companies. We believe that CIM has proven its ability to source, structure and manage private investments for us since our inception in 2012. In addition, CIM maintains a deep and diverse network of highly experienced and like-minded partners including, without limitation, public and private lenders, selected middle-market private equity sponsors, large private equity sponsors (on a limited basis), and lightly syndicated loans. We leverage these proprietary relationships and CIM’s expertise, which we believe enables us to be highly selective with a diverse array of investment opportunities that offer the most favorable risk/reward characteristics.
•We are CIM’s only client resulting in its investment professionals sourcing for and managing a single investment platform. Since we are CIM’s only client, its investment professionals solely source for and manage our investment portfolio, which we believe results in sourcing focus and efficiencies. CIM’s investment professionals do not source and monitor the investments of other funds within a larger platform, which we believe provides for a more efficient, focused, and responsive investment process. This allows CIM’s investment professionals to provide timely, candid feedback to potential borrowers and deal partners, and to solely focus on one investment portfolio building the knowledge and expertise from sourcing, to monitoring, to exit. All investment opportunities are sourced and underwritten by CIM only with our risk and return objectives in mind, which we believe mitigates the potential risk of conflict among numerous portfolio managers within a larger platform.
•First lien investment focus rather than relying on the capital structure to generate risk-adjusted returns. Although CIM will selectively target higher return/special situation investments in the secondary loan market through the purchase of illiquid, lightly syndicated loans, CIM focuses primarily on senior secured first lien loans to private U.S. middle-market companies rather than relying on such borrower’s capital structure to generate risk-adjusted returns from junior debt or equity investments. In addition to providing us with favorable returns, we believe that this first lien investment focus allows us to mitigate risk in the event of a borrower’s default since we will be in a senior secured first lien position with respect to such borrower’s assets. 
•Long-term investment horizon.  We believe that our flexibility to make investments with a long-term view provides us with the opportunity to generate favorable returns on invested capital and expands the types of investments that we may consider. The long-term nature of our capital structure helps us avoid disposing of assets at unfavorable prices and we believe makes us a better partner for portfolio companies.
•Transaction sourcing capability.  CIM seeks to identify attractive investment opportunities both through active origination channels and through its long-term relationships with numerous corporate and fund management teams, members of the financial community and potential corporate partners. We also have access to the experience of CIM’s officers in sourcing middle-market transactions through such persons’ network of originators and underwriters. We believe that the broad networks of CIM and its affiliates will continue to produce a significant amount of investment opportunities for us.
•Disciplined, income-oriented investment philosophy.  CIM employs a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection. This investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity as well as ongoing monitoring by CIM of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of credit deterioration. This strategy is designed to maximize current yield and minimize the risk of capital loss while maintaining potential for long-term capital appreciation.
•Ability to utilize a wide range of transaction structures.  Although CIM focuses primarily on senior secured first lien debt, we believe that CIM’s broad expertise and experience in transaction structuring at all levels of a company’s capital structure affords us numerous tools to manage risk while preserving the opportunity for returns on investments. We attempt to capitalize on this expertise in an effort to produce an investment portfolio that will perform in a broad range of economic conditions. In addition, we believe that the ability to offer several forms of financing makes us an attractive provider of capital to prospective portfolio companies. Such flexible transaction structuring allows a prospective portfolio company to forego the substantial cost of conducting multiple negotiations and undergoing multiple due diligence processes to secure the different types of capital it requires.
Investment Types

There are a number of investment types corresponding to a company’s capital structure. Typically, investors determine the appropriate type of investment based upon their risk and return requirements. Below is a diagram illustrating where these investments lie in a typical target company’s capital structure. First lien debt is situated at the top of the capital structure, and typically has the first claim on the assets and cash flows of the company, followed by second lien debt, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and finally common equity. Due to this priority of cash flows and claims on assets, an investment’s risk increases as it moves further down the capital structure. Investors are usually compensated for this risk associated with junior status in the form of higher returns, either through higher interest payments or potentially higher capital appreciation.

We focus primarily on investments in senior secured debt, including first lien loans, second lien loans and unitranche loans, and, to a lesser extent, collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, unsecured debt, including corporate bonds and long-term subordinated loans, referred to as mezzanine loans, and equity. The mix of investments in our portfolio and other aspects regarding the implementation of our strategy may change materially over time.
Although we focus primarily on senior secured first lien debt, CIM can tailor our investment focus as market conditions evolve. Depending on market conditions and other factors, we may, as noted above, increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure, where returns tend to be stronger in a more stable or growing economy, but less secure in weak economic environments. We rely on CIM’s experience to structure investments, potentially using all levels of the capital structure, which we believe will perform in a broad range of economic environments.

Typical Leveraged Capital Structure Diagram

 Senior Secured Debt

 First Lien Loans

First lien secured loans are situated at the top of the capital structure. Because these loans have priority in payment, they carry the least risk among all investments in a company. Generally, our first lien secured loans are expected to have maturities of three to seven years, offer some form of amortization, and have first priority security interests in the assets of the borrower. We expect that our first lien secured loans typically will have variable interest rates ranging between 4.0% and 9.0% over a standard benchmark, such as the prime rate, LIBOR or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
Unitranche Loans

Unitranche loans provide all of the debt needed to finance a leveraged buyout or other corporate transaction, both senior and subordinated, but generally in a first lien position, while the borrower generally pays a blended, uniform interest rate rather than different rates for different tranches. Unitranche loans generally require payments of both principal and interest throughout the life of the loan. Unitranche loans generally have contractual maturities of five to seven years and interest is generally paid quarterly. Generally, we expect these securities to carry a blended yield that is between first lien secured and subordinated debt interest rates. Unitranche loans provide a number of advantages for borrowers, including the following: simplified documentation, greater certainty of execution and reduced decision-making complexity throughout the life of the loan. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
Second Lien Loans

Second lien secured loans are immediately junior to first lien secured loans and have substantially the same maturities, collateral and covenant structures as first lien secured loans. Second lien secured loans, however, are granted a second priority security interest in the assets of the borrower. In return for this junior ranking, second lien secured loans generally offer higher returns compared to first lien secured debt. These higher returns come in the form of higher interest and in some cases the potential for equity participation through warrants, though to a lesser extent than with mezzanine loans. Generally, we expect these loans to carry a fixed rate of 10.0% to 13.0% or a floating current yield of 7.0% to 12.0% over the prime rate, LIBOR or SOFR. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
Unsecured Debt

In addition to first lien loans and second lien loans, we also may invest a portion of our assets in unsecured debt, including corporate bonds and subordinated debt. Unsecured debt investments usually rank junior in priority of payment to first lien loans and second lien loans, but are situated above preferred equity and common stock in the capital structure. In return for their junior status compared to first lien loans and second lien loans, unsecured debt investments typically offer higher returns through both higher interest rates and possible equity ownership in the form of warrants, enabling the lender to participate in the capital appreciation of the borrower. These warrants typically require only a nominal cost to exercise. We intend to generally target unsecured debt with interest-only payments throughout the life of the security, with the principal due at maturity. Typically, unsecured debt investments have maturities of five to ten years. Generally, we expect these securities to carry a fixed rate of 10% to 15%. In addition, we may receive additional returns from any warrants we may receive in connection with these investments. In some cases, a portion of the total interest may accrue or be paid in kind.
Collateralized Securities, Structured Products and Other

We may also invest in collateralized securities, structured products and other similar securities, which may include collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, collateralized bond obligations, or CBOs, collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, structured notes and credit-linked notes. These investments may be structured as trusts or other types of pooled investment vehicles. They may also involve the deposit with or purchase by an entity of the underlying investments and the issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities backed by, or representing interests in, the underlying investments or referencing an indicator related to such investments. CDOs, CBOs and CLOs are types of asset-backed securities issued by special purpose vehicles created to reapportion the risk and return characteristics of a pool of assets. The underlying pool for a CLO, for example, may include domestic and foreign senior loans, senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans.
Equity and Equity-Related Securities

While we intend to maintain our focus on investments in debt securities, from time to time, when we see the potential for significant gains, or in connection with securing particularly favorable terms in a debt investment, we may make non-control investments in preferred or common equity, typically in conjunction with a private equity sponsor we believe to be of high quality. Alternatively, we may hold equity-related securities consisting primarily of warrants or other equity interests generally obtained in connection with our unsecured debt investments. In the future, we may achieve liquidity through a merger or acquisition of a portfolio company, a public offering of a portfolio company’s stock or by exercising our right, if any, to require a portfolio company to repurchase the equity-related securities we hold. With respect to any preferred or common equity investments, we expect to target an annual investment return of at least 20%.

Non-U.S. Securities

We may invest in non-U.S. securities, which may include securities denominated in U.S. dollars or in non-U.S. currencies, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We may maintain a certain level of cash or equivalent instruments to make follow-on investments, if necessary, in existing portfolio companies or to take advantage of new opportunities.
Comparison of Targeted Debt Investments to Corporate Bonds
Loans to private companies are debt instruments that can be compared to corporate bonds to aid an investor’s understanding. As with corporate bonds, loans to private companies can range in credit quality depending on security-specific factors, including total leverage, amount of leverage senior to the security in question, variability in the issuer’s cash flows, the quality of assets securing debt and the degree to which such assets cover the subject company’s debt obligations. As is the case in the corporate bond market, we will require greater returns for securities that we perceive to carry increased risk. The companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buyouts or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national rating agencies. We believe that our targeted debt investments typically will carry ratings from a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization, or NRSRO, and that such ratings generally will be below investment grade (rated lower than “Baa3” by Moody’s or lower than “BBB-” by S&P). To the extent we make unrated investments, we believe that such investments would likely receive similar ratings if they were to be examined by an NRSRO. Compared to below-investment grade corporate bonds that are typically available to the public, our targeted first lien secured and second lien secured loan investments are higher in the capital structure, have priority in receiving payment, are secured by the issuer’s assets, allow the lender to seize collateral if necessary, and generally exhibit higher rates of recovery in the event of default. Corporate bonds, on the other hand, are often unsecured obligations of the issuer.

The market for loans to private companies possesses several key differences compared to the corporate bond market. For instance, due to a possible lack of debt ratings for certain middle market firms, and also due to the reduced availability of information for private companies, investors must conduct extensive due diligence investigations before committing to an investment. This intensive due diligence process gives the investor significant access to management, which is often not possible in the case of corporate bondholders, who rely on underwriters, debt rating agencies and publicly available information for due diligence reviews and monitoring of corporate issuers. While holding these investments, private debt investors often receive monthly or quarterly updates on the portfolio company’s financial performance, along with possible representation on the company’s board of directors, which allows the investor to take remedial action quickly if conditions happen to deteriorate. Due to reduced liquidity, the relative scarcity of capital and extensive due diligence and expertise required on the part of the investor, we believe that private debt securities typically offer higher returns than corporate bonds of equivalent credit quality.
CION/EagleTree Partners, LLC
On December 21, 2021, we formed CION/EagleTree Partners, LLC, or CION/EagleTree, an off-balance sheet joint venture partnership with ET-BC Debt Opportunities, LP, or ET-BC, which is an affiliate of EagleTree Capital, LP, or EagleTree. EagleTree made a Firm-level investment with proprietary capital. CION/EagleTree jointly pursue debt opportunities and special situation, crossover, subordinated and other junior capital investments that leverages our and EagleTree's combined sourcing and portfolio management capabilities.
We contributed a portfolio of second lien loans and equity investments and ET-BC contributed proprietary Firm-level cash in exchange for 85% and 15%, respectively, of the senior secured notes, participating preferred equity, and common share interests of CION/EagleTree. We and ET-BC are not required to make any additional capital contributions to CION/EagleTree. Our equity investment in CION/EagleTree is not redeemable. All portfolio and other material decisions regarding CION/EagleTree must be submitted to its board of managers, which is comprised of four members, two of whom were selected by us and the other two were selected by ET-BC. Further, all portfolio and other material decisions require the affirmative vote of at least one board member from us and one board member from ET-BC.
We also serve as administrative agent to CION/EagleTree to provide servicing functions and other administrative services. In certain cases, these servicing functions and other administrative services may be performed by CIM.
On December 21, 2021, CION/EagleTree issued senior secured notes of $61,629 to us and $10,875 to ET-BC, or the CION/EagleTree Notes. The CION/EagleTree Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 14.0% per year and are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the assets of CION/EagleTree. The obligations of CION/EagleTree under the CION/EagleTree Notes are non-recourse to us.
Operating and Regulatory Structure

Our investment activities are managed by CIM and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent. 
Pursuant to our investment advisory agreement, as amended and restated, we pay CIM an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as incentive fees based on our performance. The annual base management fee is calculated at a rate of 1.5% of the average value of our gross assets (including cash pledged as collateral for our secured financing arrangements, but excluding other cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets) to the extent that our asset coverage ratio is greater than or equal to 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity); provided that, the annual base management fee is reduced to 1.0% of the average value of our gross assets (including cash pledged as collateral for our secured financing arrangements, but excluding other cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets) purchased with leverage resulting in our asset coverage ratio dropping below 200%. At our Special Meeting of Shareholders on December 30, 2021, shareholders approved a proposal to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150%, which became effective on December 31, 2021. The annual base management fee is payable to CIM quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the two most recently completed calendar quarters. 
The incentive fee consists of two parts.
•The first part, which we refer to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable to CIM quarterly in arrears based upon our “pre-incentive fee net investment income” for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, measured quarterly and expressed as a rate of return on our net assets at the beginning of the calendar quarter, equal to 1.625% per quarter, or an annualized rate of 6.5%, or the hurdle rate. We pay to CIM (x) 100.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate, but is less than or equal to 1.970% in any calendar quarter (7.879% annualized) and (y) 17.5% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.970% in any calendar quarter (7.879% annualized); and
•The second part of the incentive fee, which we refer to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from our investment portfolio during operations and is determined and payable to CIM in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement). This fee equals 17.5% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees on capital gains.
On July 11, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the third amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CIM, or the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, for the purpose of creating a joint venture between AIM and CIG. Under the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, AIM became a member of CIM and was issued a newly-created class of membership interests in CIM pursuant to which AIM, among other things, shares in the profits, losses, distributions and expenses of CIM with the other members in accordance with the terms of the Third Amended CIM LLC Agreement, which results in CIG and AIM each owning a 50% economic interest in CIM.
On July 10, 2017, our independent directors unanimously approved the termination of the investment sub-advisory agreement with AIM, effective as of July 11, 2017. Although the investment sub-advisory agreement and AIM's engagement as our investment sub-adviser were terminated, AIM continues to perform certain services for CIM and our company. AIM is not paid a separate fee in exchange for such services, but is entitled to receive distributions as a member of CIM as described above.
On December 4, 2017, the members of CIM entered into the fourth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of CIM, or the Fourth Amended CIM LLC Agreement, under which AIM performs certain services for CIM, which include, among other services, providing (a) trade and settlement support; (b) portfolio and cash reconciliation; (c) market pipeline information regarding syndicated deals, in each case, as reasonably requested by CIM; and (d) monthly valuation reports and support for all broker-quoted investments. AIM may also, from time to time, provide us with access to potential investment opportunities made available on Apollo’s credit platform on a similar basis as other third-party market participants. All of our investment decisions are the sole responsibility of, and are made at the sole discretion of, CIM's investment committee, which consists entirely of CIG senior personnel. 
Pursuant to an administration agreement, CIM provides us with general ledger accounting, fund accounting, investor relations, employee compensation and benefit-related services, and other administrative services. In addition, we have contracted with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC to provide additional accounting and administrative services.
We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects pursuant to the 1940 Act. Within the limits of existing regulation, we will adjust our use of debt, according to market conditions, to the level we believe will allow us to generate maximum risk-adjusted returns. We elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
Sources of Income

The primary means through which our shareholders will receive a return of value is through interest income, dividends and capital gains generated by our investments. In addition to these sources of income, we may receive fees paid by our portfolio companies, including one-time closing fees paid at the time an investment is made and/or monitoring fees paid throughout the term of our investments. Closing fees typically range from 1.0% to 3.0% of the purchase price of an investment, while annual monitoring fees generally range from 0.25% to 1.0% of the purchase price of an investment. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment or capital structuring fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees.
Risk Management

We seek to limit the downside potential of our investment portfolio by:
•applying our investment strategy guidelines for portfolio investments;
•requiring a total return on investments (including both interest and potential appreciation) that adequately compensates us for credit risk;
•creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of investments, size permitting, with an adequate number of companies, across different industries, with different types of collateral; and
•negotiating or seeking debt investments with covenants or features that protect us while affording portfolio companies flexibility in managing their businesses consistent with preservation of capital.
Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights. We may also enter into interest rate hedging transactions at the sole discretion of CIM. Such transactions will enable us to selectively modify interest rate exposure as market conditions dictate. Furthermore, our ability to engage in hedging transactions may be adversely affected by recent rules adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC.
Affirmative Covenants

Affirmative covenants require borrowers to take actions that are meant to ensure the solvency of the company, facilitate the lender’s monitoring of the borrower, and ensure payment of interest and loan principal due to lenders. Examples of affirmative covenants include covenants requiring the borrower to maintain adequate insurance, accounting and tax records, and to produce frequent financial reports for the benefit of the lender.
Negative Covenants

Negative covenants impose restrictions on the borrower and are meant to protect lenders from actions that the borrower may take that could harm the credit quality of the lender’s investment. Examples of negative covenants include restrictions on the payment of distributions and restrictions on the issuance of additional debt without the lender’s approval. In addition, certain covenants restrict a borrower’s activities by requiring it to meet certain earnings interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio requirements. These covenants are also referred to as financial or maintenance covenants.
Investment Process

The investment professionals employed by CIM have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to make investments in private companies. Our transaction process is highlighted below.
Our Transaction Process

Sourcing

CIM utilizes its access to transaction flow to source transactions. With respect to CIM’s origination channel, CIM seeks to leverage CION Investments' significant industry relationships and investment personnel that actively source new investments. We believe that CIM’s broad networks have produced and will continue to produce a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us.
Evaluation

Initial Review.  In its initial review of an investment opportunity to present to us, CIM’s transaction team examines information furnished by the target company and external sources, including rating agencies, if applicable, to determine whether the investment meets our basic investment criteria and other guidelines, within the context of creating and maintaining a broad portfolio of investments, and offers an acceptable probability of attractive returns with identifiable downside risk.
Credit Analysis/Due Diligence.  Before undertaking an investment, the transaction team from CIM conducts a thorough due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy, which may include:
•a full operational analysis to identify the key risks and opportunities of the target’s business, including a detailed review of historical and projected financial results;
•a detailed analysis of industry dynamics, competitive position, regulatory, tax and legal matters;
•on-site visits, if deemed necessary, as well as telephone calls and meetings with management and other key personnel;
•background checks to further evaluate management and other key personnel;
•a review by legal and accounting professionals, environmental or other industry consultants, if necessary;
•financial sponsor due diligence, including portfolio company and lender reference checks, if necessary; and
•a review of management’s experience and track record.
When possible, our advisory team seeks to structure transactions in such a way that our target companies are required to bear the costs of due diligence, including those costs related to any outside consulting work we may require.
CIM may integrate environmental, social and governance, or ESG, risk considerations within its process for originating loans to U.S. middle market companies. As part of its due diligence process, CIM may consider, alongside other relevant factors, ESG risks, events or conditions that have or could have a material negative impact on the operating and performance metrics of these borrowers in the portfolio. Depending on the circumstances, examples of ESG risks can include physical environmental risks, climate change transition risks, supply chain disruptions, improper labor practices, lack of board diversity and corruption. CIM may utilize proprietary research to assess ESG risks that are relevant to our investment.

Execution 

Recommendation.  CIM seeks to maintain a defensive approach toward its investment recommendations by emphasizing risk control in its transaction process, which includes (1) the pre-review of each opportunity by one of its portfolio managers to assess the general quality, value and fit relative to our portfolio, (2) where possible, transaction structuring with a focus on preservation of capital in varying economic environments and (3) ultimate approval of investment recommendations by CIM’s investment committee.
Approval.  After completing its internal transaction process, the CIM transaction team makes formal recommendations for review and approval by CIM's investment committee. In connection with its recommendation, it transmits any relevant underwriting material and other information pertinent to the decision-making process. Each new investment that we make requires the approval of a majority of members of CIM's investment committee.
Monitoring

Portfolio Monitoring.  CIM closely monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis, as well as monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if each is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. In addition, depending on the size, nature and performance of the transaction, senior investment professionals of CIM may take board seats or obtain board observation rights for our portfolio companies.

CIM has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which includes, but are not limited to, the assessment of success in adhering to a portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants; periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; comparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry; attendance at and participation in board meetings; and review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
CIM uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. These ratings are just one of several factors that CIM uses to monitor our portfolio, are not in and of themselves determinative of fair value or revenue recognition and are presented for indicative purposes. CIM rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.
The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating used in this ratings system:

Investment Rating | Description 
 | Indicates the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 
 | Indicates a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing in accordance with our analysis of its business and the full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. 
 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased since origination or acquisition, but full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. A portfolio company with an investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. 
 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased significantly since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and noncompliance with debt covenants, and we expect some loss of interest, dividend or capital appreciation, but still expect an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment.
 | Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. Loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment is expected, which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment. 

     For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, CIM enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.

CIM monitors and, when appropriate, changes investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, CIM reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis.

The following table summarizes the composition of our investment portfolio based on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, excluding short term investments of $10,869 and $87,917, respectively:

 | December 31, 2022 | | December 31, 2021 
Investment Rating | InvestmentsFair Value | | Percentage ofInvestment Portfolio | | InvestmentsFair Value | | Percentage ofInvestment Portfolio
 | $ | 24,450 | | | 1.4 | % | | $ | 47,221 | | | 2.8 | %
 | 1,424,681 | | | 81.5 | % | | 1,373,509 | | | 82.4 | %
 | 260,662 | | | 14.9 | % | | 233,223 | | | 14.0 | %

 | $ | 1,749,161 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 1,666,122 | | | 100.0 | %

 The amount of the investment portfolio in each rating category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of such portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the rating of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values.
Valuation Process.  Each quarter, we value investments in our portfolio, and such values are disclosed each quarter in reports filed with the SEC. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are recorded at such market quotations. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors determines the fair value of investments, including through delegation to CIM as our valuation designee, in good faith utilizing the input of our audit committee, CIM, and any other professionals or materials that our board of directors deems worthy and relevant, including independent third-party valuation firms, if applicable.

Managerial Assistance.  As a BDC, we must offer, and provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Depending on the nature of the assistance required, CIM will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than CIM, will retain any fees paid for such assistance.
Exit

Exit Transactions.  We seek to invest in companies that can generate consistent cash flow to repay their loans while maintaining growth in their businesses. We expect this internally generated cash flow to be a key means through which we will receive timely payment of interest and loan principal. Additionally, we attempt to invest in portfolio companies whose business models and growth prospects offer attractive exit possibilities via third-party transactions, including sales to strategic or other buyers and initial public offerings of common stock. Such third-party transactions may be particularly important in realizing capital gains through the equity portions of our investments. We also seek to exit investments in secondary market transactions when price targets are achieved or circumstances otherwise warrant.
Use of Leverage - Our Financing Arrangements
To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of CIM. Our (i) $675 million senior secured credit facility, or the JPM Credit Facility, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, or JPM, (ii) $150 million repurchase agreement, or the UBS Facility, with UBS AG, or UBS, (iii) $125 million senior unsecured notes due in 2026, or the 2026 Notes, (iv) $30 million unsecured term loan, or the 2021 More Term Loan, with More Provident Funds Ltd., or More, (v) $50 million unsecured term loan facility, or the 2022 More Term Loan, with More, and (vi) approximately $80.7 million in Series A unsecured notes due in 2026, or the Series A Notes, allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as “leverage” and could increase or decrease returns to our shareholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. As of December 31, 2022, our total outstanding consolidated indebtedness, at par value, was approximately $957.5 million, $752.5 million of which was secured and was indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and we had $72.5 million of commitments available to be borrowed under our existing secured financing arrangements. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our financing arrangements.
On March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum “asset coverage” ratio from 200% to 150% and, as a result, to potentially increase the ratio of a BDC's debt to equity from a maximum of 1-to-1 to a maximum 2-to-1, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. At our Special Meeting of Shareholders on December 30, 2021, shareholders approved a proposal to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150%, which allows us to increase the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur. Such asset coverage ratio became effective on December 31, 2021. We are required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities was 192% and 212%, respectively.
Determination of Net Asset Value

The value of our assets is determined quarterly and at such other times that an event occurs that materially affects the valuation. The valuation is made pursuant to Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, which requires that we value our assets as follows: (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available, and (ii) for all other securities and assets, at fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors. As a BDC, Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act requires the board of directors to determine in good faith the fair value of portfolio securities for which a market price is not readily available, and it does so in conjunction with the application of our valuation procedures by CIM. In accordance with Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, our board of directors has designated CIM as our “valuation designee.” Our board of directors and the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised solely of our independent directors, oversees the activities, methodology and processes of the valuation designee.
There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each asset while employing a valuation process that is consistently followed. Determinations of fair value involve subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations in our consolidated financial statements.
Regulation

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC is a special category of investment company under the 1940 Act that was added by Congress to facilitate the flow of capital to private companies and small public companies that do not have efficient or cost-effective access to public capital markets or other conventional forms of corporate financing. BDCs make investments in private or thinly-traded public companies in the form of long-term debt and/or equity capital, with the goal of generating current income or capital growth.
BDCs are closed-end funds that elect to be regulated as BDCs under the 1940 Act. As such, BDCs are subject to only certain provisions of the 1940 Act, as well as the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. BDCs are provided greater flexibility under the 1940 Act than are other investment companies in dealing with their portfolio companies, issuing securities, and compensating their managers. BDCs can be internally or externally managed and may qualify to elect to be taxed as RICs for federal tax purposes. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters, and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of a BDC’s directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as a BDC, unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) a majority of our outstanding voting securities.

We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders, and our shareholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing shareholders, in payment of distributions and in certain other limited circumstances. On September 15, 2022, our shareholders approved our ability to sell or otherwise issue during the next year shares of our common stock at a price below our then current NAV per share in one or more public or private offerings of our common stock not exceeding 25% of such then outstanding shares. If we issue such shares and again receive such approval from shareholders in 2023 or otherwise in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current NAV per share of common stock.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in negotiating or investing in certain investments. For example, we generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain entities affiliated with CIM in transactions originated by CIM or its affiliates unless we obtain an exemptive order from the SEC. On August 30, 2022, we, CIM and certain of our affiliates were granted the Order by the SEC for us to co-invest with other funds managed by CIM or certain affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit CIM or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Order permits us to co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds, even if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. Even though we were granted the Order by the SEC, CIM’s investment committee may determine that we should not participate in a co-investment transaction.

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might indirectly subject our shareholders to additional expenses as they will indirectly be responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. None of our investment policies are fundamental and any may be changed without shareholder approval.
Qualifying Assets

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:

1.Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer that:
a.is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the U.S.;
b.is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
c.satisfies any of the following:
i.does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
ii.has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
iii.is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
iv.is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.
2.Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control. 
3.Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
4.Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
5.Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
6.Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the U.S. and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Depending on the nature of the assistance required, CIM will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than CIM, will retain any fees paid for such assistance.
Temporary Investments

Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we may not meet the RIC diversification tests, as further described in the “Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company” section below, in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. CIM will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities

We were permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. Recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. On December 30, 2021, we received approval from our shareholders to reduce our minimum "asset coverage" ratio from 200% to 150% in accordance with the 1940 Act. Such asset coverage ratio became effective on December 31, 2021. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Business Development Companies - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
Code of Ethics

We and CIM have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. The code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2019, which is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. Shareholders may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Compliance Policies and Procedures

We and CIM have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer, or CCO, is responsible for administering our policies and procedures and CIM’s chief compliance officer is responsible for administering its policies and procedures.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to CIM. The proxy voting policies and procedures of CIM are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by CIM and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
Introduction

As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, CIM has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of CIM are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy Policies

CIM will vote proxies relating to our securities in a manner that it believes, in its discretion, to be in the best interest of our shareholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although CIM will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.

The proxy voting decisions of CIM are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to the chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (b) officers and employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how CIM intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. The CCO of CIM will work with the appropriate senior officers to resolve any conflict that may arise.

Proxy Voting Records

Shareholders may obtain information, without charge, regarding how CIM voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, c/o CĪON Investment Corporation, 100 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10017.
Privacy
The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
We generally will not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to shareholders who purchase our common stock. We may collect nonpublic personal information regarding our existing investors from sources such as subscription agreements, investor questionnaires and other forms; individual investors’ account histories; and correspondence between us and individual investors. We may share information that we collect regarding an investor with our affiliates and the employees of such affiliates for everyday business purposes, for example, to service the investor’s accounts and, unless an investor opts out, provide the investor with information about other products and services offered by us or our affiliates that may be of interest to the investor. In addition, we may disclose information that we collect regarding investors to third parties who are not affiliated with us (i) as authorized by our investors in investor subscription agreements; (ii) as required by applicable law or in connection with a properly authorized legal or regulatory investigation, subpoena or summons, or to respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorities having property jurisdiction; (iii) as required to fulfill investor instructions; or (iv) as otherwise permitted by applicable law to perform support services for investor accounts or process investor transactions with us or our affiliates.
Any party not affiliated with us that receives nonpublic personal information relating to investors from us is required to adhere to confidentiality agreements and to maintain appropriate safeguards to protect your information. Additionally, for officers, employees and agents of ours and our affiliates, access to such information is restricted to those who need such access to provide services to us and investors. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to seek to guard investor nonpublic personal information. For a discussion of the risks associated with cyber incidents, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—General Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with cybersecurity and cyber incidents” in this report.
Election to be Taxed as a Regulated Investment Company

We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our shareholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid. We refer to this as the Annual Distribution Requirement.
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company

If we:
•qualify as a RIC; and
•satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,
then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to shareholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders.

We will be subject to a 4.0% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98.0% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.

In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
•continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
•derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90% Income Test; and
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
◦at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
◦no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.
For federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with contractual “payment-in-kind,” or PIK, interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash.
Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to qualify for and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forego new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. Our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. As a result, we may be prohibited from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. Even if we are not prohibited from making distributions, our ability to raise additional capital to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement may be limited. If we are not able to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.
Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (2) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (3) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (4) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (5) cause us to recognize income or gain without receipt of a corresponding distribution of cash, (6) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (7) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (8) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions, but there can be no assurance that any adverse effects of these provisions will be mitigated.

If we purchase shares in a passive foreign investment company, or a PFIC, we may be subject to federal income tax on its allocable share of a portion of any “excess distribution” received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares even if our allocable share of such income is distributed as a taxable dividend to our shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code, or a QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income our allocable share of any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss our allocable share of any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases included in our income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax.
Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance

We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our co-chief executive officers and our chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
•pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and
•pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We intend to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Due to our Listing, we are no longer a “non-accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and as a result, commencing with this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we are required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires our independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Complying with Section 404(b) requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. We are subject to significant documentation and administrative burdens as a result of being required to comply with Section 404(b), which requires us to utilize additional resources, and our internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our securities.
Competition
Our primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, CLOs, private funds, including hedge funds, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Some of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. 
In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. 
We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer and CIM believes that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. Rather, we compete with our competitors based on our reputation in the market, our existing investment platform, the seasoned investment professionals of CIM, our experience and focus on middle-market companies, our disciplined investment philosophy, our extensive industry focus and relationships and our flexible transaction structuring. 
Compliance with NYSE Listing Requirements 
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CION”. As a listed company on the NYSE, we are subject to various listing standards including corporate governance listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with these rules and standards. On February 26, 2023, our common stock also listed on the TASE under the symbol “CION”, which subjects us to various TASE listing standards including corporate governance listing standards. We believe we are also in compliance with these rules and standards.
Other

We are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.

We provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Employees
We do not currently have any employees and we do not currently intend to hire any in the future. The compensation of our chief financial officer and treasurer, Keith S. Franz, and our chief compliance officer and secretary, Stephen Roman, is paid by CIM. We reimburse CIM for the compensation paid to our chief financial officer and his staff and our chief compliance officer and his staff.  In the future, CIM may retain additional investment personnel based upon its needs.
Recent Developments
Series A Notes
On February 28, 2023, we entered into a Deed of Trust, or the Deed of Trust, with Mishmeret Trust Company Ltd., as trustee, under which we issued approximately $80.7 million in aggregate principal amount of our Series A Notes. The Series A Notes offering in Israel closed on February 28, 2023 and the Series A Notes listed and commenced trading on the TASE on February 28, 2023. After the deduction of fees and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $77.9 million, which we intend to use to make investments in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objectives and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Series A Notes are rated A1.il by Midroog Ltd., an affiliate of Moody’s.
The Series A Notes will mature on August 31, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at par plus a “make-whole” premium, if applicable, as set forth in the Deed of Trust. The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus a credit spread of 3.82% per year, which will be paid quarterly on February 28, May 31, August 31, and November 30 of each year, commencing on May 31, 2023. The Series A Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Series A Notes, rank pari passu with all our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, rank effectively junior to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and rank structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.
The Deed of Trust contains other terms and conditions, including, without limitation, affirmative and negative covenants such as (i) information reporting, (ii) maintenance of our status as a business development company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, (iii) minimum shareholders’ equity of $525 million, (iv) a minimum asset coverage ratio of not less than 150%, and (v) an unencumbered asset coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00. In addition, the Deed of Trust contains customary events of default with customary cure and notice periods, including, without limitation, nonpayment, incorrect representation in any material respect, breach of covenant, cross-default under our other indebtedness in an outstanding aggregate principal amount of at least $50,000,000, certain judgments and orders, and certain events of bankruptcy.
On February 26, 2023, our shares of common stock listed and commenced trading on the TASE under the ticker symbol “CION”.
Q1 2013 Regular Distribution
On March 13, 2023, our co-chief executive officers declared a regular quarterly distribution of $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2023 payable on March 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of March 24, 2023.
