General

Tompkins Financial Corporation (“Tompkins” or the “Company”) is headquartered in Ithaca, New York and is registered as a Financial Holding Company with the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is a locally oriented, community-based financial services organization that offers a full array of products and services, including commercial and consumer banking, leasing, trust and investment management, financial planning and wealth management, and insurance. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s subsidiaries included: four wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, Tompkins Trust Company (the “Trust Company”), The Bank of Castile (DBA Tompkins Bank of Castile), Mahopac Bank (DBA Tompkins Mahopac Bank), VIST Bank (DBA Tompkins VIST Bank); and a wholly-owned insurance agency subsidiary, Tompkins Insurance Agencies, Inc. (“Tompkins Insurance”). The Trust Company provides a full array of trust and investment services under the Tompkins Financial Advisors brand, including investment management, trust and estate, financial and tax planning as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance services. The Company’s principal offices are located at 118 E. Seneca St., P.O. Box 460, Ithaca, New York, 14850, and its telephone number is (888) 503-5753. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol “TMP.”

Tompkins was organized in 1995, under the laws of the State of New York, as a bank holding company for the Trust Company, a commercial bank that has operated in Ithaca, New York and surrounding communities since 1836.

The Tompkins strategy centers around its core values and a commitment to delivering long-term value to our clients, communities, and shareholders. To achieve this, the Company has a variety of strategic initiatives focused on delivering high quality products and services; a continual focus on improving operational effectiveness, investing in our people through talent management and development, maintaining appropriate risk management programs, and delivering profitable growth across all of our business lines. The Company's growth strategy includes initiatives to grow organically through our current businesses, as well as through possible acquisitions of financial institutions, branches, and financial services businesses. As such, the Company has acquired, and from time to time considers acquiring, banks, thrift institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or other businesses that would complement the Company’s business or its geographic reach. The Company generally targets merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company has pursued acquisition opportunities in the past, and continues to review new opportunities. 
Although Tompkins is a corporate entity, legally separate and distinct from its affiliates, bank holding companies such as Tompkins are generally required to act as a source of financial strength for their banking subsidiaries. Tompkins’ principal source of income is dividends from its subsidiaries. There are certain regulatory restrictions on the extent to which these subsidiaries can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Tompkins. See the section “Supervision and Regulation” for further details.

Narrative Description of Business

The Company has identified three business segments, consisting of banking, insurance and wealth management.

Banking services consist primarily of attracting deposits from the areas served by the Company’s 4 banking subsidiaries’ 66 banking offices (46 offices in New York and 20 offices in Pennsylvania), and using those deposits to originate a variety of commercial loans, agricultural loans, consumer loans, real estate loans, and leases in those same areas. The Company’s lending function is managed within the guidelines of a comprehensive Board-approved lending policy. Policies and procedures are reviewed on a regular basis. Reporting systems are in place to provide management with ongoing information related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans. The Company has an independent third party loan review process that reviews and validates the risk identification and assessment made by the lenders and credit personnel. The results of these reviews are presented to the Board of Directors of each of the Company’s banking subsidiaries, and the Company’s Audit Committee.

The Company’s principal expenses are interest on deposits, interest on borrowings, and operating and general administrative expenses, as well as provisions for loan and lease losses. Funding sources, other than deposits, include borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and cash flow from lending and investing activities. The Company’s principal source of revenue is interest income on loans and securities.

The Company maintains a portfolio of securities such as obligations of U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities, obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof, and equity securities. Management typically invests in securities with short to intermediate average lives in order to better match the interest rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities. Investment decisions are made within policy guidelines established by the Company’s Board of Directors. The investment policy is based on the asset/liability management goals of the Company, and is monitored by the Company’s Asset/Liability Management Committee. The intent of the policy is to establish a portfolio of high quality diversified securities, which optimizes net interest income within safety and liquidity limits deemed acceptable by the Asset/Liability Management Committee.

The Company has operated its insurance agency subsidiary, Tompkins Insurance Agencies Inc., since 2001. Insurance services include property and casualty insurance, employee benefit consulting, life, long-term care and disability insurance. Tompkins Insurance is headquartered in Batavia, New York. Over the years, Tompkins Insurance has acquired smaller insurance agencies in the market areas served by the Company’s banking subsidiaries and successfully consolidated them into Tompkins Insurance. Tompkins Insurance offers services to customers of the Company’s banking subsidiaries by sharing offices with Tompkins Bank of Castile, the Trust Company, and Tompkins VIST Bank. In addition to these shared offices, Tompkins Insurance has five stand-alone offices in Western New York, and one stand-alone office in Tompkins County, New York. 

Wealth management services consist of investment management, trust and estate, financial and tax planning as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance services. Wealth management services are provided under the trade name Tompkins Financial Advisors. Tompkins Financial Advisors has office locations, and services are available, within all four of the Company’s subsidiary banks.
Subsidiaries 

The Company operates four banking subsidiaries, and an insurance agency subsidiary. In addition, the Company also owns 100% of the common stock of Sleepy Hollow Capital Trust I, Leesport Capital Trust II, and Madison Statutory Trust I. The Company’s banking subsidiaries operate 66 offices, including 2 limited-service offices, with 46 banking offices located in New York and 20 banking offices located in southeastern Pennsylvania. The decision to operate as four locally managed community banks reflects management’s commitment to community banking as a business strategy. For Tompkins, personal delivery of high quality services, a commitment to the communities in which we operate, and the convergence of a single-source financial service provider characterize management’s community banking approach. The combined resources of the Tompkins organization provide increased capacity for growth and the greater capital resources necessary to make investments in technology and services. Tompkins has a comprehensive suite of products and services in the markets served by all four banking subsidiaries. These services include trust and investment services, insurance, leasing, card services, Internet banking, and remote deposit services.

Competition

Competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the Company’s market areas. In one or more aspects of its business, the Company’s subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, Internet-based financial services companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the Company does not currently provide. In addition, many of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive Federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and Federally-insured banks.

Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit and service charges, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of facilities and services, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. Management believes that a community-based financial organization is better positioned to establish personalized financial relationships with both commercial customers and individual households. The Company’s community commitment and involvement in its primary market areas, as well as its commitment to quality and personalized financial services, are factors that contribute to the Company’s competitiveness. Management believes that each of the Company’s subsidiary banks can compete successfully in its primary market areas by making prudent lending decisions quickly and more efficiently than its competitors, without compromising asset quality or profitability. In addition, the Company focuses on providing unparalleled customer service, which includes offering a strong suite of products and services. Although management feels that this business model has caused the Company to grow its customer base in recent years and allows it to compete effectively in the markets it serves, we cannot assure you that such factors will result in future success.
Supervision and Regulation

Regulatory Agencies 
As a registered financial holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended (“BHC Act”), and is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”). The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is subject to disclosure and regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company's activities are also subject to regulation under the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act (which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers), the Truth-in-Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (which governs the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies), the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (which requires financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans), the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts and practices in or affecting commerce), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, as well as other federal, state and local laws. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the Symbol “TMP” and as a result the Company is subject to the rules of the NYSE American for listed companies.
The Company’s banking subsidiaries are subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”), and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (“PDBS”). Each of these agencies issues regulations and requires the filing of reports describing the activities and financial condition of the entities under its jurisdiction. Likewise, such agencies conduct examinations on a recurring basis to evaluate the safety and soundness of the institutions, and to test compliance with various regulatory requirements, including: consumer protection, privacy, fair lending, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, sales of non-deposit investments, electronic data processing, and trust department activities.
The Company’s insurance subsidiary is subject to examination and regulation by the NYSDFS and the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.
The Company’s wealth management subsidiary is subject to examination and regulation by various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). The trust division of Tompkins Trust Company is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC and NYSDFS. 
4

Federal Home Loan Bank System 
The Company’s banking subsidiaries are also members of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions for home mortgage and neighborhood lending. The Company’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the rules and requirements of the FHLB, including the requirement to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, up to a maximum of $25.0 million. The Company’s banking subsidiaries were in compliance with FHLB rules and requirements as of December 31, 2018.
Regulatory Reform 
The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) placed U.S. banks and financial services firms under enhanced regulation and oversight. While many provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act are currently effective, certain provisions of the legislation are still subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the federal regulatory agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act was amended on May 24, 2018, when the President signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) into law. The EGRRCPA amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and provided targeted modifications to other post-financial-crisis regulatory requirements. In addition, the legislation establishes new consumer protections and amends various securities-related and investment company-related requirements. Some EGRRCPA provisions were immediately effective, some have later-specified effective dates and still others are open-ended and subject to implementation by federal regulatory agency rule-making. EGRRCPA includes a variety of provisions that are likely to affect the Company, including the following:

• | EGRRCPA includes a simplified capital rule change which directs federal banking agencies to adopt rules that exempt "qualifying community banks"--banks with assets of less than $10 billion--that exceed the “community bank leverage ratio” from all risk-based capital requirements, including Basel III, and deems such banks "well capitalized" for purposes of federal "prompt corrective action" capital standards. This exemption is not effective until federal banking agencies establish a community bank leverage ratio (a ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets) of between 8% and 10%. The Company was, as of December 31, 2018, a qualifying community bank.


• | EGRRCPA requires federal banking agencies to amend the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule such that all qualifying investment-grade, liquid and readily-marketable municipal securities are treated as level 2B liquid assets;


• | EGRRCPA modified and limited the definition of "high volatility commercial real estate" loans that trigger heightened risk-based capital requirements to ease the burden of those requirements;


• | EGRRCPA provides that capped amounts of reciprocal deposits of certain FDIC-insured institutions shall not be considered "brokered deposits," subject to certain limitations, for institutions meeting minimum capital and exam-rating requirements;


• | EGRRCPA exempts some community banks from mortgage escrow requirements, exempts certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than $400,000 from appraisal requirements and implements a "qualified mortgage" exemption for community banks which satisfies, subject to certain limitations, the "ability to repay" requirements in the Truth in Lending Act; and


• | EGRRCPA exempts certain qualifying financial institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets, such as the Company, from the Volcker Rule proprietary trading requirements implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act.

While EGRRCPA does and will continue to improve regulatory conditions for the Company, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations remain effective and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, the EGRRCPA requires the enactment of a number of implementing regulations, the details of which may change how this law ultimately impacts the Company. Further, it is possible that the current climate of regulatory reform will lead to new legislation in addition to or supplementing the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA which may subject the Company to additional or expanded regulation. The effects of any potential new legislation are unknown and difficult to predict at this time. 
Debit-Card Interchange Fees
FRB regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act limit interchange fees on debit cards to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards. However, FRB regulations prohibit all card issuers, including the Company and its banking subsidiaries, from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to fewer than two unaffiliated networks, or inhibiting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of the electronic debit transaction over any network that the card issuer has enabled to process them.
5

Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” As of December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding investments of approximately $600,000 in covered funds (the "Legacy Investments") which we would have been required to divest no later than July 2022 per our agreement with the FRB. However, under the newly-enacted EGRRCPA, the Company, as a financial institution with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, is exempt from meeting the Volcker Rule's proprietary trading requirements. Therefore, no further Volcker Rule divestitures are required unless the Company crosses the $10 billion in total assets threshold.
Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation 
We are a bank holding company subject to regulation under the BHC Act and the examination and reporting requirements of the FRB. In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, we qualified for the status of and elected to be a financial holding company under the BHC Act and therefore may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB), without prior approval of the FRB.
If a bank holding company seeks to engage in the broader range of activities permitted under the BHC Act for financial holding companies, as we do, (i) the bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined in the FRB's Regulation Y and (ii) it must file a declaration with the FRB that it elects to be a “financial holding company.” If we cease to meet these requirements, the Company will not be in compliance with the BHC Act’s requirements and the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities to encourage compliance. If the Company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may require divestiture of our depository institutions, among other potential penalties and limitations. To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed.” A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be “well capitalized” if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned “Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action,” below. A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well managed” if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination. A financial holding company’s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable FRB regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the FRB’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions. Bank holding companies and banks must also be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.
In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). See the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act”, below.
The FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
Share Repurchases and Dividends 
Under FRB regulations, the Company may not, without providing prior notice to the FRB, purchase or redeem its own common stock if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to ten percent or more of the Company’s consolidated net worth.

6

FRB regulations provide that dividends shall not be paid except out of current earnings and unless the prospective rate of earnings retention by the Company appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Tompkins’ primary source of funds to pay dividends on its common stock is dividends from its subsidiary banks. The subsidiary banks are subject to regulations that limit the dividends that they may pay to Tompkins. Member banks may not declare or pay a dividend during the current calendar year that exceeds the sum of the bank's net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless approved by the pertinent regulatory agencies. 

Transactions with Affiliates and Other Related Parties 
There are Federal laws and regulations that govern transactions between the Company’s non-bank subsidiaries and its banking subsidiaries, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related regulations. These laws establish certain quantitative limits and other prudent requirements for loans, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions between a member bank and its affiliates. In general, transactions between the Company’s banking subsidiaries and its non-bank subsidiaries must be on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the banking subsidiaries as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving non-affiliated companies. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization.
The Company’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O as promulgated by the FRB. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s board of directors.
Mergers and Acquisitions 
The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of interests in commercial banks. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a person, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FRB or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the CRA (see the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act” included elsewhere in this item) and fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
Source of Strength Doctrine
The Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, Tompkins is expected to commit resources to support its banking subsidiaries, including at times when it may not be advantageous for Tompkins to do so. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions 
FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company that is in danger of default. “Default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. “In danger of default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.
Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action
The Basel III Capital Rules were implemented by the FRB in 2013, became effective for Tompkins on January 1, 2015 and were subject to a phase-in period that concluded on January 1, 2019.
7

The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations.
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios, capital conservation buffer and other deductions/adjustments are being phased in as follows:

Basel III Capital- Timeline & Transition Period 
Phase-in Schedule 
 | | | | | Full Phase-in
Ratio | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 
Minimum Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% 
Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio | 4.5% | 4.5% | 4.5% | 4.5% | 4.5% 
Minimum Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio | 6.0% | 6.0% | 6.0% | 6.0% | 6.0% 
Minimum Total Risk-based Capital Ratio | 8.0% | 8.0% | 8.0% | 8.0% | 8.0% 
Buffer | | | | | 
Capital Conservation Buffer | 0.00% | 0.625% | 1.25% | 1.875% | 2.50% 
Minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Plus Capital Conservation Buffer | 4.5% | 5.125% | 5.75% | 6.375% | 7.00% 
Minimum Tier 1 Capital Plus Capital Conservation Buffer | 6.0% | 6.625% | 7.25% | 7.875% | 8.50% 
Minimum Total Capital Plus Capital Conservation Buffer | 8.0% | 8.625% | 9.25% | 9.875% | 10.50% 
Deductions / Adjustments | | | | | 
Phase-in of certain deductions and adjustments | 40% | 60% | 80% | 100% | 

Under Basel III, the Company is required to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer, fully phased in on January 1, 2019, is 2.5%. At December 31, 2018, the Company complied with the capital conservation buffer requirement.
As fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules require Tompkins to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which when fully phased in, effectively results in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which when fully phased-in, effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which when fully phased in, effectively results in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. If we have a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied), we will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a “countercyclical capital buffer” that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to apply to Tompkins for the foreseeable future.
The Basel III Capital Rules imposed stricter regulatory capital deductions from and adjustments to capital, with most deductions and adjustments taken against CET1 capital. These include, for example, the requirement that (i) mortgage servicing assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities; (ii) deferred tax assets, which cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, net 
8

of any relative valuation allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities; and (iii) significant investments (i.e. 10% or greater ownership) in unconsolidated financial institutions be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015. The deductions were phased-in over a four-year period, beginning on January 1, 2015 and concluding on January 1, 2019.
Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effect of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded, which could result in significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company’s securities portfolio. Contained within the rule was a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in the capital calculation based upon asset size. Tompkins decided to opt out of this requirement in January 2015.
The Basel III Capital Rules also required the phase-out of certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies. However, because the trust preferred securities held by Tompkins were issued prior to May 19, 2010, and because Tompkins’ total consolidated assets were less than $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, these trust preferred securities are permanently grandfathered under the final rule and may continue to be included as Tier 1 capital.

In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

The Standardized Approach Proposal expands the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories, including many residential mortgages and certain commercial real estate loans. Specifics include, among other things:

– | Applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans.


– | For residential mortgage exposures, the current approach of a 50% risk weight for high-quality seasoned mortgages and a 100% risk-weight for all other mortgages is replaced with a risk weight of between 35% and 200% depending upon the mortgage’s loan-to-value ratio and whether the mortgage is a “category 1” or “category 2” residential mortgage exposure (based on eight criteria that include the term, use of negative amortization, balloon payments and certain rate increases).


– | Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due.


– | Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%).


– | Providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction.


– | Providing for a 100% risk weight for claims on securities firms.


– | Eliminating the current 50% cap on the risk weight for OTC derivatives.


Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) requires federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) should an insured depository institutions fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. If an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well- capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.
With respect to the Company’s banking subsidiaries, the Basel III Capital Rules revised the PCA regulations, by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 and a 3% leverage ratio to be considered adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules did not change the total risk- based capital requirement for any PCA category. Additionally, Bank holding companies and insured depository institutions may also be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity for unsafe or 
9

unsound practices in conducting their business or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by federal banking agencies or term of a written agreement with such agency. The Company is in compliance, and management believes that the Company will continue to be in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios as such requirements are phased in.
For further information concerning the regulatory capital requirements, actual capital amounts and the ratios of Tompkins and its bank subsidiaries, see the discussion in “Note 20 - Regulations and Supervision” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Report.

Deposit Insurance 
Substantially all of the deposits of the Company’s banking subsidiaries are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per deposit category, per depositor, per institution retroactive to January 1, 2008.

The Company’s banking subsidiaries pay deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on assessment rates established by the FDIC. The assessment rates are based upon asset size and other risks the institution poses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF. Under this assessment system, risk is defined and measured using an institution’s supervisory ratings with other risk measures, including financial ratios. The current total base assessment rates on an annualized basis range from 1.5 basis points for certain “well-capitalized,” “well-managed” banks, with the highest ratings, to 40 basis points for institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. The FDIC may raise or lower these assessment rates on a quarterly basis based on various factors to achieve a reserve ratio, which the Dodd-Frank Act has mandated to be no less than 1.35 percent of insured deposits. In 2011, the FDIC redefined the deposit insurance assessment base to equal average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
FDIC insurance expense totaled $2.6 million, $2.5 million and $3.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. FDIC insurance expense includes deposit insurance assessments, and Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds. FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. 

Depositor Preference 
The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, such as the Company’s subsidiary banks, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC, as subrogee of the insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institutions.
Community Reinvestment Act 
The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire service area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of such banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary banks all had ratings of satisfactory or better.
Federal Securities Laws
The common stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, the Company is subject to the reporting, information disclosure, proxy solicitation and other requirements imposed on public companies by the SEC under the Exchange Act. Additionally, Company insiders are subject to security trading limitations and are required to file insider ownership reports with the SEC. The SEC and NYSE American have adopted regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) and the Dodd-Frank Act that apply to the Company as an exchange-traded, public company, which seek to improve corporate governance, accounting, and reporting requirements, provide enhanced penalties for financial reporting improprieties and improve the reliability of disclosures in SEC filings. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements include: (1) requirements for audit committees, including independence and financial expertise; (2) certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company; 
10

(3) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (4) disclosure and reporting requirements for the reporting company and directors and executive officers; and (5) a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of securities laws. 

Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act 
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”), the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, and other federal laws, collectively impose obligations on all financial institutions, including the Company, to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.

Financial Privacy
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect consumer information. Under the GLBA, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies and certain security breaches to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These provisions affect, among other things, how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions take many forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to a U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Consumer Protection Laws
In connection with their lending and leasing activities, the Company’s banking subsidiaries are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and similar laws at the state level. The Company’s failure to comply with any of the consumer financial laws can result in civil actions, regulatory enforcement action by the federal banking agencies and the U.S. Department of Justice.
Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. The Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with the rules of the CFPB; however, these rules are generally enforced by our primary regulators, the FRB and the FDIC.
Cybersecurity 
The Bank is also subject to data security standards and privacy and data breach notice requirements as established by federal and state regulators. Federal banking agencies, through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cybersecurity risks and identify, assess and mitigate these risks, both internally and at critical third party service providers. For example, federal banking regulators have highlighted that financial institutions should establish several lines of defense and design their risk management processes to address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials. Further, financial institutions are expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes designed to facilitate a recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack.
11

Additionally, the Company must comply with a NYSDFS rule entitled “Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies,” which became effective March 1, 2017, subject to a full phase-in over the following two years, concluding in 2019. This NYSDFS rule requires financial services companies, including Tompkins, to maintain a maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the company’s information systems, establish cybersecurity policies and procedures, identify persons responsible for implementing and enforcing the cybersecurity program and cybersecurity policies and procedures, and conduct periodic risk assessments of its information systems. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity.

Incentive Compensation 
The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as the Company, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in May 2016. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to that initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which the Company may structure compensation for its executives. Given the uncertainty at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted, management cannot determine the potential impact on the Company.
Additionally, the FRB, OCC and FDIC have issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Management believes the current and past compensation practices of the Company do not encourage excessive risk taking or undermine the safety and soundness of the organization.
The FRB reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in reports of examination and deficiencies can lead to limitations on the Company’s abilities and even enforcement actions. 
The Company is also subject to the NYSDFS rule “Guidance on Incentive Compensation Arrangements,” which directs all New York state regulated banks (including the Trust Company, Tompkins Bank of Castile, and Tompkins Mahopac Bank) to ensure that any employee incentive arrangements do not encourage inappropriate risk-taking or improper sales practices. Under this guidance, incentive compensation based on employee performance indicators may only be paid if the bank has effective risk management, oversight and control systems in place. We believe the Company is compliant with all state and federal regulation regarding incentive compensation
Other Legislative Initiatives 
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory authorities. These initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions, proposals to change the financial institution regulatory environment, or proposals that affect public companies generally. Such legislation could change banking laws and the operating environment of Tompkins in substantial, but unpredictable ways. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,035 employees, approximately 116 of whom were part-time. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the Company believes its employee relations are excellent.
