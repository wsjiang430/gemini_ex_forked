ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Revance is a biotechnology company focused on setting the new standard in healthcare with innovative aesthetic and therapeutic offerings that elevate patient and physician experiences. Revance’s aesthetics portfolio of expertly created products and services, including DAXXIFY®, the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and OPUL®, the first-of-its-kind relational commerce platform for aesthetic practices, deliver a differentiated and exclusive offering for Revance’s elite practice partners and their consumers. Revance has also partnered with Viatris to develop an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, which will compete in the existing short-acting neuromodulator marketplace. Revance’s therapeutics pipeline is currently focused on muscle movement disorders including evaluating DAXXIFY® in two debilitating conditions, cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Macroeconomic Environment on Our Operations 
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected global economic activity, our commercialization activities, the timing of the regulatory process for DAXXIFY® GL Approval, our initial supply and launch timing of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, research and development activities and our ability to maintain on-site operations. While we have seen a general return toward more normalized levels for aesthetic procedures and many of the effects and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic subsided during the year ended December 31, 2022, the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance is unknown. 
Additionally, the U.S. and global financial markets have recently experienced significant volatility, which has led to disruptions to commerce and pricing stability, impacts to foreign exchange rates, labor shortages, global inflation, higher interest rates and supply chain disruptions. Due to current inflationary pressures, we have experienced higher costs throughout our business, which we expect may continue during 2023. 
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic conditions is highly uncertain and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our regulatory process, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, end user demand for our Products and Services, commercialization efforts, business operations, clinical trials and other aspects of our business and the aesthetics industry, the healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole.
See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors—The current COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to, and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises may, adversely affect our financial condition and our business.”
Key 2022 Developments 
Revance Aesthetics
In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated $125.1 million in revenue from the sale of our Products and our Services. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 5,000 aesthetic accounts across our Products and Services.
DAXXIFY®
In September 2022, we received DAXXIFY® GL Approval. DAXXIFY® is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and neuromuscular blocking agent indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines associated with corrugator and/or procerus muscle activity in adult patients.
Following DAXXIFY® GL Approval we trained a group of faculty members on DAXXIFY® as part of PrevU, our early experience program for the product, which we initiated in December 2022. PrevU focuses on providing practices with product education, tools for practice integration, and the opportunity to gain real-world clinical insights for DAXXIFY® with the goal of optimizing aesthetic outcomes. We recognized $11.0 million in revenue from the sales of DAXXIFY® during 
PrevU programs. We anticipate expanding the commercial introduction of DAXXIFY® following the completion of the PrevU program by the end of March 2023. We established a commercial sales team in July 2020 to support the launch of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and to support the commercial launch of DAXXIFY® and continued commercialization of the RHA Collection® of dermal fillers in 2023. 
In order to meet anticipated commercial demand, we plan to manufacture DAXXIFY® in our Northern California manufacturing facility and through ABPS, if approved. We submitted a PAS for the ABPS manufacturing facility, and in October 2022, the FDA accepted our PAS submission. We anticipate the potential approval of the PAS in 2023.
RHA® Collection of Dermal Fillers
In September 2022, we launched RHA® Redensity, the first and only FDA-approved dermal filler for both superficial dermal, and dermal injection of dynamic perioral rhytids (lip lines) in adults aged 22 years or older. RHA® Redensity is the latest advancement to hyaluronic acid dermal filler technology and the newest addition to the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, which already includes RHA® 2, 3 and 4. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $118.1 million in product revenue from the sale of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers.
OPUL® Relational Commerce Platform
On October 11, 2021, we launched the OPUL® Relational Commerce Platform. OPUL® is a fully integrated PayFac pursuant to the Payment Facilitator Agreement with a third-party acquirer and sponsor bank. OPUL® replaces the HintMD Platform, which we began the process of sunsetting from general availability in 2022. Following the completion of the sunsetting process, we expect that most customers of the HintMD Platform will become customers of OPUL®.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $7.0 million in service revenue from the Fintech Platform. Since the Fintech Platform generates revenue as a percentage of credit card processing volumes, we use GPV as a key indicator of the ability of the Fintech Platform to generate revenue. GPV measures the total dollar amount of all transactions processed in the period through the Fintech Platform, net of refunds. The Company also uses the Fintech Platform PayFac capabilities to process credit card transactions for Products purchased from the Company; these transactions are not included in GPV. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Fintech Platform processed $665.2 million of GPV.
Revance Therapeutics
We are pursuing regulatory approval of DAXXIFY® for the treatment of cervical dystonia. On January 6, 2023, the FDA accepted for review the supplemental BLA for DAXXIFY® for the treatment of cervical dystonia that we submitted in October 2022. The PDUFA date is August 19, 2023. If the supplemental BLA is approved on or by the PDUFA date, we plan to initiate an early experience program, followed by broad commercial launch in 2024.
Disciplined Capital Allocation 
In October 2021, we took measures to defer or reduce costs in the near term in order to preserve capital and increase financial flexibility as a result of the delay in the DAXXIFY® GL Approval from our initial expectation. These measures included but were not limited to: pausing non-critical hires; deferring the Phase 3 clinical program for upper limb spasticity and other therapeutics pipeline activities; and deferring international regulatory and commercial investment for DAXXIFY®, with the exception of costs required to support our partnership with Fosun. These cash preservation measures impacted our ability and the timing to execute our corporate strategy discussed below in “—Our Strategy” for the year ended December 31, 2022.
In 2022, our capital resources were focused on supporting our strategic priorities, which included: (i) obtaining DAXXIFY® GL Approval; (ii) continuing to drive revenue growth by increasing adoption of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers; and (iii) expanding and deepening customer relationships through OPUL®. With the DAXXIFY® GL Approval, we will continue our focus on disciplined capital allocation to support the growth of the aesthetics portfolio in addition to preparing for the Company's potential entry into therapeutics for cervical dystonia. We will continue to assess expense 
management and the timing of capital allocation measures as it relates to our therapeutics pipeline activities and international regulatory investments for DAXXIFY®. 
For additional information, see Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Our Strategy
Our objective is to be a leading provider of botulinum toxin products across multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications and to expand the opportunity for botulinum toxin products and other innovative and complementary products and services, including hyaluronic acid dermal fillers and OPUL®. 
Key elements of our strategy are:
•We plan to leverage DAXXIFY®’s unique formulation and duration profile to build valuable franchises in aesthetics and therapeutics. We believe DAXXIFY® has the ability to expand the neuromodulator opportunity by appealing to consumers who seek a long-lasting effect. 
•We aim to set a new standard in the aesthetics industry through the commercialization of our portfolio of innovative and complimentary Products and Services, including DAXXIFY®, the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and OPUL®.
•We plan to leverage DAXXIFY® to pursue a therapeutics program that will advance the treatment of multiple indications, with a current focus in muscle movement disorders including cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity. We also plan to evaluate our pipeline for other therapeutic indications, such as migraine.
•We have and will continue to selectively evaluate partnerships, distribution opportunities, joint development agreements and acquisitions as a way to expand our aesthetic and therapeutic franchises while enhancing our competitive position. Our partnership with Teoxane enabled us to enter the dermal filler market in the U.S. and provides us with an opportunity to set a foundation for the commercialization of DAXXIFY® and future aesthetic products. We have the potential to enter the second largest neuromodulator market with strategic partnerships like the Fosun License Agreement, whereby we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DAXXIFY® in the Fosun Territory. Further, we have entered into the Viatris Agreement, pursuant to which we are collaborating with Viatris exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, which provides us with the potential to participate in the short-acting neuromodulator market.
The Botulinum Toxin Opportunity 
Botulinum toxin is a protein and neurotoxin produced by clostridium botulinum. Since 1989, botulinum toxin has been used to treat a variety of aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the U.S. and globally. Botulinum toxin blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to receptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. Throughout this Report, we use neuromodulators to refer to botulinum toxins and neurotoxins.
According to the DRG, the global market opportunity for neuromodulators was estimated to be $6.3 billion in 2022 compared to $5.7 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach approximately $9.2 billion by 2027, registering a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7.8% from 2022 to 2027. DRG estimates that the market opportunity for aesthetic indications and therapeutic indications in 2022 is approximately 53% and 47%, respectively. We expect continued growth to be driven by demographics, changing lifestyle, new indications and product launches in new geographies. 
For information on competition we face in these markets, please see “—Product Competition” below.
    The Opportunity for Neuromodulators for Aesthetic Indications
Injectable neuromodulator treatments are the single largest cosmetic procedure in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., neuromodulators have been approved to treat three aesthetic indications, glabellar lines, forehead lines and LCLs. According to DRG, in 2022, 10.3 million neuromodulator aesthetic injections were performed, which represents an increase of 8% over 2021. Also, according to DRG, the global aesthetic neuromodulator market opportunity was estimated to be $3.3 billion in 2022 compared to $3.0 billion in 2021. The global aesthetic neuromodulator market is projected to reach approximately $4.8 billion by 2027, registering a five-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7.4% from 2022 to 2027. 
We believe that we are positioned to take advantage of this growing market opportunity due to the long-lasting duration profile of DAXXIFY®. In our SAKURA Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of glabellar lines, DAXXIFY® demonstrated a median time to the loss of none or mild wrinkle severity of 24 weeks (6 months) and a median time to return to baseline wrinkle severity of approximately 28 weeks (7 months), as documented on the prescribing information. According to the prescribing information from other neuromodulators on the market, duration of effect of these products ranges between three to four months. We believe we are well positioned for injector and consumer adoption. According to our 2018 Harris Poll survey results, 86% of the injectors surveyed wanted a neuromodulator that offered longer-lasting results than what was available, and 88% of the consumers considered long lasting duration very important or absolutely essential. In addition, our primary qualitative market research among aesthetic injectors, consumers, and office practice managers indicated that longer duration than what is currently available on the market is a differentiating and desirable attribute. Quantitative market research also shows most consumers visit their injectors less than twice per year for treatments.
We believe that a neuromodulator product which shows persistence of effect over time will be a desirable treatment regimen for injectors and consumers and will align with existing consumer habits. We believe that a product with a long-lasting duration would enable consumers to remain more satisfied between treatments.
The Opportunity for Neuromodulators for Therapeutic Indications
In the U.S., neuromodulators have been approved for the treatment of cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity (adult and pediatric), lower limb spasticity, chronic migraine headache, urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, blepharospasm, strabismus, hyperhidrosis and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (adult and pediatric). In addition, neuromodulator products are being evaluated in clinical trials for other therapeutic indications, including acne, rosacea, skin and wound healing, scar reduction, hair loss, major depressive disorder, atrial fibrillation and several musculoskeletal and neurological conditions.
We are currently pursuing the development and commercialization of DAXXIFY® for the treatment of cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity because we believe there is opportunity to improve injectable neuromodulator outcomes and overall health system costs in muscle movement disorders. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person’s ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. Cervical dystonia is a painful and disabling chronic condition in which the neck muscles contract involuntarily, causing abnormal movements and awkward posture of the head and neck. Cervical dystonia affected approximately 60,000 people in the U.S. According to DRG, the global market opportunity for cervical dystonia in 2022 was approximately $473 million and is expected to grow to approximately $663 million by 2027, registering a five-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7.0% from 2022 to 2027. 
Muscle spasticity happens after the body’s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke, trauma or disease. Muscle spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. Certain tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become difficult, and a person’s self-esteem may be affected by an abnormal posture. Spasticity affected approximately 500,000 people in the U.S. and approximately 12 million people globally. According to DRG, the global spasticity market in 2022 was approximately $827 million and is expected to grow to $1.3 billion by 2027. 
Although currently approved neuromodulators have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of muscle movement disorders, such neuromodulator injections must be repeated every three to four months. According to the peer-reviewed article Patient Perspectives on the Therapeutic Profile of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A in Cervical Dystonia, published in the Journal of Neurology in 2020, out of cervical dystonia patients surveyed, 88% of patients treated with botulinum neurotoxin type A products experienced symptom reemergence between treatment sessions, with a 
mean time to reemergence of approximately 10.5 weeks. In addition, most botulinum neurotoxin type A labels recommend waiting at least 12 weeks prior to re-treatment. We believe there is a significant need for a long-lasting injectable neuromodulator, which has the potential to offer consumers and payers more value by reducing the frequency of visits while also allowing consumers to achieve more durable symptom relief between injection cycles. We believe that DAXXIFY® has the potential to provide these benefits if approved. In 2021, we completed the ASPEN-1 Phase 3 clinical program for the treatment of cervical dystonia and the JUNIPER Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. In the ASPEN-1 Phase 3 clinical trial, DAXXIFY® demonstrated a median duration of effect of 24.0 weeks in one treatment group and 20.3 weeks in another treatment group. In the JUNIPER Phase 2 clinical trial, DAXXIFY® demonstrated a median duration of at least 24 weeks across all three doses. See “—Our Product Candidates— DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection—DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the Treatment of Therapeutic Indications.”
The Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Filler Opportunity 
Dermal fillers are injected into the superficial and deep layers of the skin to restore volume, smooth lines, provide facial lift and contour, plump the lips or improve the appearance of facial scars commonly caused by acne. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers represent 91% of the total U.S. dermal filler market, and according to DRG, hyaluronic acid dermal fillers were the second most common aesthetic injectable procedure in 2022. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in the body, primarily in the skin, joints and connective tissue. With age, human skin loses its ability to produce hyaluronic acid, resulting in the loss of volume, firmness and elasticity. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers are manufactured from synthesized hyaluronic acid cross-linked to significantly enhance durability in the skin. These products can restore lost volume for six to 12 months or longer before the body gradually and naturally absorbs the hyaluronic acid. Most hyaluronic acid dermal fillers also contain lidocaine to help minimize discomfort during and after treatment. 
In 2022, DRG estimated that 3.1 million hyaluronic acid dermal filler procedures were performed in the U.S. According to DRG, the U.S. market opportunity for hyaluronic acid dermal fillers was estimated to be $1.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach approximately $2.2 billion by 2027, registering a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 8.9% from 2022 to 2027.
Access to the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers not only provides us with the capability to compete in the U.S. dermal filler market, but also provides a foundation for the launch of DAXXIFY® for the improvement of glabellar lines and other potential aesthetic product offerings. We believe there are long term revenue and cost synergy opportunities with neuromodulators and hyaluronic acid dermal fillers. We believe our ability to offer a comprehensive aesthetics portfolio, including DAXXIFY®, the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and OPUL®, positions us to compete with established competitors. 
For information on competition we face in this market, please see “—Product Competition” below.
The Aesthetic Practice Fintech Opportunity 
OPUL® provides a seamless, simple and smart payment solution, practice reporting and insights, and enhanced customer support that is designed to improve practice management and economics and foster loyalty with consumers. We believe that OPUL® adds to the value proposition of our aesthetics portfolio and enables us to build deeper relationships with practices. Further, OPUL® give us access to the aesthetic practice payment processing market.
In 2019, on average, a U.S.-based aesthetic practice processed $1.7 million in annual revenue. With a growing base of 40,000 aesthetic practices across the U.S., the total payment processing market opportunity in U.S. aesthetics was estimated to be $68 billion. On average, credit card processors charge 2.9% to 4.4% per transaction to complete a financial transaction depending on a variety of factors such as the type of credit card, whether the card is physically present and other variables and receive a margin of 0.5% to 1% per transaction, resulting in a $500 million revenue opportunity in the aesthetic practice fintech market. With the expected growth of the aesthetic market, the revenue for the U.S. aesthetic practice fintech market is expected to grow to approximately $700 million by 2025.
Product Pipeline Summary 
Our Products 
DAXXIFY®
DAXXIFY®, our first commercially approved product, is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and neuromuscular blocking agent indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines associated with corrugator and/or procerus muscle activity in adult patients. DAXXIFY® GL Approval was granted in the U.S. based on the results of the SAKURA Phase 3 clinical program in glabellar lines where DAXXIFY® demonstrated high response rates, long duration of effect and a safety profile consistent with other approved neuromodulator products. DAXXIFY® was also evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of UFLs, forehead lines and LCLs. We are also developing DAXXIFY® for the treatment of therapeutic indications. 
The DAXXIFY® formulation incorporates our proprietary stabilizing peptide excipient along with the other excipients: polysorbate-20, buffers and a sugar. DAXXIFY® is supplied as a lyophilized powder, which requires reconstitution with saline prior to injection. The highly positively charged peptide excipient has been shown to bind non-covalently to the daxibotulinumtoxinA molecule. The unique formulation of DAXXIFY® has enabled us to create a drug product without human serum albumin or animal-derived components, found in all other FDA approved neuromodulator products. 
Please see www.revance.com for the Full Prescribing Information including the Boxed Warning and Medication Guide for DAXXIFY®.
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Aesthetic Indications
DAXXIFY® has been studied in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of glabellar lines and in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of UFL, forehead lines and LCL. For a summary of the DAXXIFY® aesthetics clinical program, please see our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Glabellar Lines
Glabellar Lines, often called “frown lines,” are vertical lines that develop between the eyebrows and may appear as a single vertical line or as two or more lines. When one frowns, the muscles of the glabella contract causing vertical creases to form between the eyebrows. Neuromodulators are used to temporarily block the ability of nerves to trigger contraction of the injected muscle, inhibiting movement of the muscles that cause the frown lines, resulting in a smoother, more refreshed appearance. Current treatments include neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers, laser treatments and topical creams.
In December 2018, we completed a Phase 3 clinical program for glabellar lines, which included three studies: two 36-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of DAXXIFY® for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults (SAKURA Phase 1 and SAKURA Phase 2) and an 84-week, open-label safety trial designed to evaluate the long term safety of DAXXIFY® for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults following both single and repeat treatment administration (SAKURA Phase 3). Based on the results of the SAKURA clinical program, DAXXIFY® was approved for the temporary improvement of glabellar lines.
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Upper Facial Lines
UFL is the name commonly given to the combination of the three most commonly treated facial areas with neuromodulators; specifically, glabellar lines, LCLs and forehead lines. In clinical practice, a large proportion of patients seek treatment in all three areas to address signs of aging.
In December 2020, we completed a multicenter, open-label Phase 2 trial for the treatment of the UFL to understand the safety and efficacy, including potential dosing and injection patterns, of DAXXIFY®, covering the UFL. 
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Forehead Lines
Forehead lines are produced by the action of the frontalis muscle, a large, thin, vertically-oriented muscle which lifts the eyebrows. The frontalis muscle serves as an antagonist to the glabellar musculature, a natural depressor that is responsible for frowning and associated eyebrow movement. As the eyebrow is considered the aesthetic center of the upper face, forehead lines can significantly impact the aesthetic appearance of the face, contribute to increased signs of aging and convey unwanted social signals. Current treatments include neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers, laser treatments and topical creams.
In June 2020, we completed a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the treatment of moderate or severe dynamic forehead lines in conjunction with treatment of the glabellar complex. The objective was to understand the potential dosing and injection patterns of DAXXIFY® in other areas of the upper face in addition to the lead indication in glabellar lines. 
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Lateral Canthal Lines
Crow's feet are the spider-like fine lines around the outside corners of the eyes that become more obvious when someone smiles. These lines (also referred to as periorbital wrinkles, laugh lines or smile lines), fan out across the skin from the outer corner of each eye. Repetitive motions, such as squinting and smiling, can lead to the increase of wrinkles and contribute to the severity and onset of crow’s feet. Age and exposure to sun also play significant roles in development of these lines, which can deepen over time. Current treatments include eye creams and moisturizers, topical tretinoins, neuromodulator injections, dermal fillers and laser treatments. 
In June 2020, we completed a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the treatment of moderate or severe LCLs. The objective was to understand the potential dosing of DAXXIFY® in the lateral canthal area. 
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Therapeutic Indications
We are currently seeking regulatory approval of DAXXIFY® for the treatment of cervical dystonia. DAXXIFY® is also in clinical development for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. We previously evaluated DAXXIFY® for the treatment of plantar fasciitis, but we are not currently pursuing the plantar fasciitis indication due to the results of the Phase 2 study. We will continue to evaluate development for other therapeutic indications, such as migraine, informed by the results of the commercialization of DAXXIFY® for the treatment of cervical dystonia and preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by Revance and competitors.
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Cervical Dystonia
On January 6, 2023, the FDA accepted for review the supplemental BLA for DAXXIFY® for the treatment of cervical dystonia that we submitted in October 2022. The PDUFA date is August 19, 2023. If the supplemental BLA is approved on or by the PDUFA date, we plan to initiate an early experience program, followed by broad commercial launch in 2024.
Cervical dystonia is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions of the head, neck, and shoulders, resulting in pain, abnormal movements and/or postural changes. While not life-threatening, cervical dystonia can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. The cause of cervical dystonia is often unknown, and treatment with a neuromodulator is the current standard of care.
The supplemental BLA submission for the treatment of cervical dystonia is based on the results from the ASPEN clinical program. The ASPEN Phase 3 program included a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing two doses of DAXXIFY® (125 units and 250 units) to placebo designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single treatment of either 125 units or 250 units of DAXXIFY® for the treatment of cervical dystonia (ASPEN-1) and a Phase 3, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of repeat treatments of DAXXIFY® in adults with cervical dystonia (ASPEN-OLS). For a summary of the DAXXIFY® ASPEN clinical program, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Adult Upper Limb Spasticity
Spasticity is a motor symptom characterized by rigidity, muscle tightness, joint stiffness, involuntary jerky movements, exaggeration of reflexes, unusual posture, abnormal positioning and muscle spasms and can affect the hands, fingers, wrists, arms, elbows or shoulders. Muscle spasticity happens after the body’s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke or brain injury. While not life-threatening, spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. Neuromodulators are one of several approved therapies for the treatment of adult upper limb spasticity. Other treatments include oral and intrathecal muscle relaxants, physical therapy, splints, casts & braces, electrical stimulation, and surgery.
In December 2018, we initiated the JUNIPER Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DAXXIFY® for adults with moderate to severe upper limb spasticity due to stroke or traumatic brain injury. In February 2021, we announced topline data from the JUNIPER Phase 2 trial. Subjects were assigned to one of three doses of DAXXIFY® (250 units, 375 units, or 500 units) or to placebo. The trial was originally designed to enroll 128 subjects. Due to COVID-19 challenges related to continued subject enrollment and the scheduling of in-person study visits, we made the decision in June 2020 to complete study enrollment at 83 subjects.
The study’s co-primary endpoints were improvement from baseline in the MAS and the PGIC score at Week 6. One co-primary endpoint was achieved in the 500-unit treatment group, which evaluated the change in the MAS score from baseline, with demonstration of a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction from baseline in muscle tone versus placebo (p=0.0488). Proof of concept was demonstrated with all three doses being numerically higher than placebo for the improvement in the MAS score. Statistical significance was not achieved on the second co-primary endpoint, however numerical improvement compared with placebo in all three doses on the PGIC assessment was achieved. 
The study was designed to run for up to 36 weeks, with the co-primary measures: mean change from baseline in muscle tone measured with the MAS in the SMG of the elbow, wrist, or finger flexors at Week 6; and mean score of the PGIC at Week 6. The first 73 subjects, who were dosed before enrollment was paused in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were followed for up to 36 weeks, and the succeeding 10 subjects were followed up to Week 12.
On a key secondary endpoint, DAXXIFY® delivered a median duration of at least 24 weeks across all three doses. Duration of effect was defined as the time from injection (in weeks) until the loss of improvement as measured by the MAS (for the SMG) and the PGIC, or a request for retreatment by the subject. 
All three doses of DAXXIFY® were generally safe and well tolerated with no increase in the incidence of adverse events observed in the higher dose treatment groups. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. 
The JUNIPER Phase 2 trial generated sufficient data for progression to a Phase 3 study and to inform our dosing strategy and design for our Phase 3 program. In October 2021, we concluded our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, which informed the study design for our JUNIPER Phase 3 program in upper limb spasticity.
DAXXIFY® for the Treatment of Migraine
Migraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized as moderate to severe headache and often includes other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. In 2019, migraine headache affected more than 37 million people in the U.S., of which, it is estimated that more than 3 million of whom suffered from chronic migraine headache. Chronic migraine headache is both under treated and under diagnosed and is defined as more than fifteen headache days per month over a three-month period of which more than eight are migrainous, in the absence of medication overuse. 
We continue to evaluate the timing of the initiation of migraine clinical trials.
Topical
We previously evaluated preclinically and clinically a topical program for indications currently served by neuromodulator treatments. A topical product presents several potential advantages over injectable treatments, including painless topical administration, no bruising, ease of use and limited dependence on administration technique by injectors and 
other medical staff. We believe these potential advantages may improve the experience of consumers undergoing neuromodulator procedures and could make a topical product candidate suitable for multiple indications in the future. We may conduct additional preclinical work for a topical product candidate in therapeutic and aesthetic applications where neuromodulators have shown efficacy and are particularly well suited for injection-free treatments. 
Our Strategic Collaborations 
The RHA® Collection of Dermal Fillers
In January 2020, we entered into the Teoxane Agreement, as amended on September 2020, January 2021 and December 2022, pursuant to which Teoxane granted us the exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute Teoxane’s line of Resilient Hyaluronic Acid® dermal fillers, which include: (i) the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and (ii) the RHA® Pipeline Products in the U.S., U.S. territories and possessions, in exchange for 2,500,000 shares of our common stock and certain other commitments by us. 
In September 2020, we launched the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, which initially included RHA® 2, RHA® 3 and RHA® 4. In July 2022, we added RHA® Redensity to the portfolio of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers.
The RHA® Collection of dermal fillers represents the latest advancements in hyaluronic acid filler technology. The dermal filler range is created using a novel and gentle manufacturing process called preserved network technology that has few chemical modifications. The PNT process helps preserve the natural structure of the hyaluronic acid, allowing it to more closely mimic the natural hyaluronic acid found in the skin. The result is a hyaluronic acid dermal filler that is easy to inject and gives consumers a natural look.
The Teoxane Agreement is effective for a term of ten years from product launch and may be extended for a two-year period upon the mutual agreement of the parties. In September 2020, we amended the Teoxane Agreement to memorialize a revised launch date from April to September as a result of delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021 and December 2022, we amended the Teoxane Agreement by amending the innovation plan annex and quality agreement annex, respectively. Pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, we are required to meet certain minimum purchase obligations and certain minimum expenditure requirements, which are discussed in Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules—Notes to consolidated financial statements— Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies.” If Teoxane pursues regulatory approval for certain new indications or filler technologies, including innovations with respect to existing products in the U.S., we will be subject to certain specified cost-sharing arrangements for third party expenses incurred in achieving regulatory approval for such products. We also have a right of first negotiation with respect to any cosmeceutical products that Teoxane wishes to distribute in the U.S, and Teoxane will have a right of first negotiation in connection with the distribution of DAXXIFY® for aesthetic use outside the U.S. and U.S. territories where Teoxane has an affiliate. 
OnabotulinumtoxinA Biosimilar
We entered into the Viatris Agreement in February 2018, under which Revance and Viatris are collaborating exclusively, on a worldwide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®. In February 2019, we had a BIAM with the FDA and Viatris on a proposed onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate. Based on the FDA’s feedback, Revance and Viatris believe that a 351(k) pathway for the development of an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar is viable. 
In August 2019, we entered into the Viatris Amendment which, among other things, extended the period of time for Viatris to make the Continuation Decision as to whether to continue the biosimilar development program beyond the initial development plan and the BIAM. In accordance with the Viatris Amendment, Viatris was required to notify us of the Continuation Decision on or before the later of (i) April 30, 2020 or (ii) 30 calendar days from the date that we provide Viatris with certain deliverables. Pursuant to the Viatris Amendment, Viatris agreed to pay us an additional $5.0 million above the previously agreed non-refundable upfront payment of $25.0 million with contingent payments of up to $100.0 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones, tiered sales milestones of up to $225.0 million, and royalties on sales of the biosimilar in the Viatris territories previously disclosed from the Viatris Agreement. In June 2020, we announced that Viatris provided us its written notice of its Continuation Decision and paid us a $30 million milestone payment in connection with the Continuation Decision. We began the continuation phase of the 
onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program and are moving forward with characterization and product development work, followed by an anticipated filing of an IND with the FDA. Viatris has paid us an aggregate of $60 million in non-refundable fees as of December 31, 2022. 
Fosun License Agreement
In December 2018, we entered into the Fosun License Agreement with Fosun, whereby we granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DAXXIFY® in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. Fosun has paid us non-refundable fees upfront and other payments totaling $38.0 million before foreign withholding taxes as of December 31, 2022. We are also eligible to receive (i) additional remaining contingent payments of up to $222.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones based on first calendar year net sales and tiered royalty payments in low double digits to high teen percentages on annual net sales. The royalty percentages are subject to reduction in the event that (i) we do not have any valid and unexpired patent claims that cover the product in the Fosun Territory, (ii) biosimilars of the product are sold in the Fosun Territory or (iii) Fosun needs to pay compensation to third parties to either avoid patent infringement or market the product in the Fosun Territory.
Our Services 
On July 23, 2020, we completed the HintMD Acquisition. Upon the close of the HintMD Acquisition, all HintMD operations began being conducted by Revance employees. Following the HintMD Acquisition, we began to operate in two reportable segments: (i) our Product Segment, which refers to the business that includes the research, development and commercialization of DAXXIFY®, the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and our product candidates, and (ii) our Service Segment, which refers to the business that includes the development and commercialization of OPUL®, our next-generation fintech platform, and the HintMD Platform, the legacy fintech platform. For additional information about our business segments, see Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules—Notes to consolidated financial statements—Note 16—Segment Information.”
On October 11, 2021, we launched the OPUL® Relational Commerce Platform. OPUL® is a fully integrated PayFac pursuant to the Payment Facilitator Agreement with a third-party acquirer and sponsor bank. OPUL® replaces the HintMD Platform, which we began the process of sunsetting from general availability in 2022. Following the completion of the sunsetting process, we expect that most customers of the HintMD Platform will become customers of OPUL®.
OPUL® Relational Commerce Platform
Through OPUL®, we aim to transform the practice and consumer experience in the aesthetics market. OPUL® aims to improve practice management, assist with the creation of revenue opportunities and increase consumer retention for practices. OPUL®’s product offering includes the POS platform, software and hardware terminal. The hardware terminal is manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, and the POS platform and software are OPUL®’s proprietary technologies. OPUL® provides the below functionalities:

•Customizable Checkout: Customizable check out options to elevate the practice's experiences, including a comprehensive catalog concierge with access to over 7,000 aesthetic products and services.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
DAXXIFY® Manufacturing
Drug Substance
In our northern California manufacturing facility, we manufacture and perform testing for the botulinum toxin, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our bulk drug substance. Manufacture of the drug substance for DAXXIFY® is based on microbial fermentation followed by product recovery and purification steps. The process is entirely free of animal and human-derived materials and depends on standard raw materials available commercially. The process is scaled to support expected future commercial demand. Bulk drug substance is stable when stored under required conditions, which allows us to manage risk with reserves of drug substance and allows periodic drug substance production to replenish inventories as needed.
Drug Product
DAXXIFY® is manufactured by us in our northern California aseptic fill-and-finish manufacturing facility to support commercial and clinical production. The manufacturing process consists of bulk compounding, liquid fill and freeze-drying to support acceptable shelf-life duration. We also perform testing for DAXXIFY® in this facility and at other vendor locations. In order to support the anticipated commercial demand and manage potential supply chain risks, we have also entered into agreements with third-party manufacturers. 
In March 2017, we entered into the ABPS Services Agreement. ABPS will serve as a supply source and provide drug product manufacturing services for us at its aseptic manufacturing facility in San Diego, California. Under the ABPS Services Agreement, until May 2022, we were subject to minimum purchase obligations of up to $30.0 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. In May 2022, we amended a statement of work under the ABPS Services Agreement pursuant to which the minimum purchase obligations of $30.0 million per year were eliminated, and instead the minimum purchase obligations are now based on available manufacturing weeks and are negotiated prior to the beginning of each year over the term of the agreement. 
We submitted a PAS for the ABPS manufacturing facility, and in October 2022, the FDA accepted our PAS submission. We anticipate the potential approval of the PAS in 2023. ABPS has already begun producing finished drug product batches of DAXXIFY® and following the potential approval of the PAS, will begin serving as a supply source for DAXXIFY®.
In April 2021, we entered into the Supply Agreement with LSNE, pursuant to which LSNE would serve as a non-exclusive manufacturer and supplier of our anticipated products currently under development. The LSNE Supply Agreement provides us with an additional source of drug manufacturing to support clinical development and commercialization of the Products to potentially mitigate supply chain risk. Pursuant to the LSNE Supply Agreement, we will be responsible for an estimated $28 million in costs associated with the design, equipment procurement and validation and facilities-related costs, which would be paid in accordance with a payment schedule based on the completion of specified milestones.
The initial term of the obligations underlying the LSNE Supply Agreement is dependent upon the date of regulatory submission for the applicable product and may be sooner terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the LSNE Supply Agreement. The term of the LSNE Supply Agreement may also be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The LSNE Supply Agreement also sets forth, among other things, the Company's purchase requirements, pricing and payment information, deliverables, timelines, milestones, payment schedules, manufacturing facility obligations and development of a drug manufacturing process. The parties would also enter into quality agreements and other supplements which detail the process and product specifications for the applicable Product. The LSNE Supply Agreement also contains provisions relating to compliance with cGMPs and applicable laws and regulations, and to intellectual property, indemnification, confidentiality, representations and warranties, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
Outsourced Components of Drug Product
We also contract with third parties for the manufacture of the additional components required for DAXXIFY®, including the manufacture of bulk peptide. We currently rely on a single source supplier for the development, manufacture and supply of peptide. To decrease the risk of an interruption to our drug supply, we maintain an inventory of peptide. 
Supply of the RHA® Collection of Dermal Fillers
We are a distributor of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and are not involved in the manufacturing process. We rely on Teoxane to supply us with the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Sales and Marketing
In August 2020, we became a commercial company and launched the prestige aesthetics portfolio, which included RHA® 2, RHA® 3 and RHA® 4 of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, and the HintMD Platform, which has been re-launched as OPUL®. In July 2022, we added RHA® RedensityTM to the portfolio of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, and, in September 2022, we expanded our portfolio to include DAXXIFY®, following the DAXXIFY® GL Approval. 
Following the DAXXIFY® GL Approval, we trained a group of faculty members on DAXXIFY® as part of PrevU, our early experience program for the product, which we initiated in December 2022. PrevU focuses on providing practices with product education, tools for practice integration, and the opportunity to gain real-world clinical insights with the goal of optimizing aesthetic outcomes. We anticipate a full commercial rollout of DAXXIFY® following the completion of the PrevU program by the end of March 2023. We have an established commercial sales team that we scaled to support the launch of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers and intend to expand to support the commercial launch of DAXXIFY® and continued commercialization of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers in 2023. Our sales team consists of a product sales team, which is dedicated to the sales of our Products and a services sales team, which is dedicated to the commercialization of OPUL®. As of December 31, 2022, our commercial sales team consisted of approximately 100 members, which we intend to expand as the Company grows. 
Distribution
We rely on one or more third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the packaging, storage and distribution of DAXXIFY® and the storage and distribution of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers. Our third-party service providers deliver our Products to our customers. We recognize revenue from the sales of our Products once they are delivered to our customers. We frequently rely on one third-party service provider to distribute our Products, which could expose us to shipping delays and delays in revenue recognition to the extent we experience a sudden loss of that third-party service provider or that third-party service provider’s operations are disrupted or impacted. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors—We rely on one or more third-party service providers for the distribution of our Products. If we experienced a sudden loss of any third-party distributor or such distributor experiences a disruption in its operations, it would affect the delivery of our Products to our customers, which could negatively impact our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.”
Seasonality
Sales of the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers have been subject to the impact of traditional seasonality in the aesthetic facial injectables market, which historically has experienced higher sales in the second and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the first and third calendar quarters. Given the early stage of commercialization of DAXXIFY®, we cannot predict what impact seasonality will have on its sales.
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, novel biological discoveries, drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent 
applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, copyright, trademarks and trade secret laws, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Such protection is also maintained using confidential non-disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from using technology that we have developed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected.
As of December 31, 2022, Revance and its subsidiaries held approximately 312 issued patents and approximately 99 pending patent applications, including foreign counterparts of U.S. patents and applications. 44 of our patents are issued in the U.S., with the rest issued in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, various countries in Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. In addition, we have pending patent applications in the U.S. as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Columbia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore and South Korea. We will continue to pursue additional patent protection as well as take appropriate measures to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our innovative technologies.
It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire or develop, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or for other inventions we seek to protect. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us, or any of our pending patent applications, may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent, or patent applications, or license them to another entity. Please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property” for more information. 
For example, on May 2, 2018, Allergan filed an Opposition in the European Patent Office against our European Patent No. EP 2 661 276 titled “Topical composition comprising botulinum toxin and a dye.” While the opposed patent is not material to DAXXIFY®, we continue to take appropriate measures to defend the patent and have appealed a decision to revoke the patent, which remains in force during the appeal. On May 2, 2019, our European Patent No. EP 2 490 986 B1 for “Methods and Systems For Purifying Non-Complexed Botulinum Neurotoxin” was opposed. At a hearing in June 2021, the Opposition Division granted amended claims in our patent. The opponent appealed our successful opposition defense to the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. We subsequently filed an appeal to preserve our ability to use all arguments throughout the appeal process. We continue to vigorously defend this patent in the European Patent Office. In November 2022, Ipsen Biopharm Limited filed an Opposition in the European Patent Office against our European Patent No. EP 3 368 071 titled “Injectable botulinum toxin formulations and methods of use thereof having long duration of therapeutic or cosmetic effect.” We will vigorously defend this patent in the European Patent Office.
Our registered U.S. trademarks include REVANCE®, DAXXIFY®, OPUL® and the Revance logo.
Product Competition 
The pharmaceutical and medical device markets are highly competitive. Our competitors are engaged in the development, research, manufacture and marketing of healthcare products. While we believe that our innovative Products and Services provide us with a competitive advantage, possible competitors may also have an ability to discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to commercialize, market and promote approved products more effectively than us. Our competitors may be able to develop competing technologies and processes that compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time. Our technologies and Products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances, products with longer duration or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. Additionally, our competitors have greater existing market share in the aesthetic market and long-standing consumer loyalty programs and sales contracts with large customers and further established business and financial relationships with customers. Competitors may also try to compete with us on price both directly, through rebates and promotional programs to high volume injectors and coupons to consumers, and indirectly, through attractive product bundling with complimentary products, such as dermal fillers, that offer convenience and an effectively lower price compared to the total price of purchasing each product separately. In addition, as more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit 
our Products or potential indications for our products increases, which could lead to litigation. Current competitors have asserted and competitors in the future could assert patent infringement claims against us, which could require us to pay damages, halt or delay commercialization, suspend the manufacture of our Products or reengineer or rebrand our Products. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
We expect to compete directly with competitors that sell injectable neuromodulator products or dermal fillers in the markets where we have a labeled indication and/or regulatory clearance. We may also indirectly compete with approved neuromodulators in other markets which are able to offer neuromodulator products and dermal fillers at lower costs. 
Injectable Botulinum Toxin Neuromodulators 
Our primary competitors for DAXXIFY® globally are expected to be companies offering injectable dose forms of neuromodulators. DAXXIFY® is currently competing in the aesthetics market, and we expect it to compete in the therapeutics market if approved for therapeutics indications. Potential current and future competitors include:
•BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic, which are marketed by AbbVie. BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic have been approved for multiple indications, including glabellar lines, forehead lines, crow's feet, spasticity, cervical dystonia and chronic migraine in the U.S. and globally.
•Dysport®, which is marketed by Ipsen Ltd. and Galderma. Dysport® has been approved for multiple indications, including glabellar lines, cervical dystonia and upper and lower limb spasticity in the U.S. and certain other countries. Dysport® is also marketed as Azzalure® for glabellar lines in certain European countries.
•Xeomin®, which is marketed by Merz. Xeomin® has been approved for multiple indications, including glabellar lines, cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity in the U.S. and certain other countries. Xeomin® is also marketed as Bocouture® for glabellar lines in certain European countries.
•Jeuveau®, which is marketed by Evolus, Inc. Jeuveau® has only been approved for the treatment of glabellar lines in the U.S. Jeuveau® is also known as NABOTA® or Nuceiva™ in certain other countries. 
•Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), which is marketed by US Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Myobloc® has been approved for multiple indications, including the treatment of cervical dystonia in the U.S. and in certain other countries. 
In addition, there are other competing neuromodulators currently being developed, going through the regulatory approval process and to be commercialized in the U.S. and other markets, including neuromodulators with extended duration claims. If other neuromodulators are approved, especially with extended duration claims, it would increase competition for DAXXIFY® and potentially limit adoption of DAXXIFY®. In addition, markets outside of the U.S. may or may not require adherence to cGMPs or the regulatory requirements of the EMA or other regulatory agencies in countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While some of these products may not meet U.S. regulatory standards, the companies operating in these markets may be able to produce products at a lower cost than U.S. and European manufacturers. 
Dermal Fillers
Our primary competitors for the RHA® Collection of dermal fillers in the U.S. include:
•the Juvéderm family of fillers, which are marketed by AbbVie. The Juvéderm family of fillers have been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe loss of jawline definition, augmentation of the chin region, moderate to severe, facial wrinkles and folds such as nasolabial folds, lip augmentation and perioral lines. 
•the Restylane® family of fillers, which are marketed by Galderma. The Restylane® family of fillers have been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds such as nasolabial folds, age-related midface contour deficiencies, volume loss of the dorsal hand, upper perioral wrinkles, and for cheek and chin augmentation. 
•RADIESSE® and RADIESSE® (+), which are marketed by Merz. RADIESSE® and RADIESSE® (+) have been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds, and for volume loss of the hand. 
•Sculptra® Aesthetic, which is marketed by Galderma. Sculptra® Aesthetic is approved for the treatment of shallow to deep nasolabial folds and facial fat loss. 
•Belotero Balance® and Belotero Balance® (+), which is marketed by Merz. Belotero Balance® and Belotero Balance® (+) are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds such as nasolabial folds.
We are aware of competing dermal fillers currently commercialized or under development in the U.S. and are monitoring the competitive pipeline environment.
Services Competition 
Aesthetic Fintech Platforms
The payment processing solutions market is large and competitive, but we believe OPUL®’s focus on the aesthetics vertical provides a competitive advantage. OPUL®, leveraging its predecessor HintMD, has focused on aesthetic practices since inception and has developed a strong understanding of the unique needs and requirements of aesthetic providers.
OPUL® expects competition to increase in the future from both established competitors and new market entrants. Current competitors include:
•Incumbent payment processing solution providers;
•Banks that offer payment processing solutions; and
•Electronic medical record systems, particularly those that may offer payment solutions.
As we continue to develop and add features and functionalities to OPUL®, we expect that we will compete with others who provide loyalty and consumer retention solutions.
Government Regulations 
Product Approval Process in the U.S. 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the FDCA, its implementing regulations, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our products and product candidates, DAXXIFY® and an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a BLA to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the U.S.
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the GLPs;
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;
•approval by an IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the GCP regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if the FDA deems it as a requirement, of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, potency, quality and purity, as well as compliance with applicable QSR for devices;
•potential inspections by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
•potential review of the BLA by an external advisory committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
Preclinical Studies
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or for other reasons. 
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population, but larger than in Phase 1, to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, such as several hundred to several thousand, at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least 2 groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Phase 4 trials can be initiated by the drug sponsor or as a condition of BLA approval by the FDA.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees.
Once the FDA receives a BLA, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete and the data are readable, before it accepts the BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months from submission in which to complete its initial review of a standard BLA and make a decision on the application, and eight months from submission for a priority BLA, and such deadline is referred to as the PDUFA date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either standard or priority BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides major additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time before the PDUFA date. 
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, potency, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; in such cases, the FDA 
will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval and limit commercial opportunity.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA can inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before a BLA can be approved. 
The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA during review. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be submitted and approved before the change may be implemented and may require the development of additional data, including preclinical studies, clinical trials or other studies. For certain proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 10 months to review the supplement. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any biologic products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA and other agencies closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, and although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturers' communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
We currently manufacture drug supplies using a combination of third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing facility. Our future collaborators may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with 
cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our biologic product candidate, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible to be the basis for an application for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Such Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process, which coincides with the period of product development and regulatory review. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Each phase of the patent term restoration period is reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence during that phase. Only one patent applicable to an approved product may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days after drug approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. We have applied for extension of patent term for three of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent term beyond the current expiration date of one of the patents.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the BPCIA, established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years, which initiates a process in which the innovator BLA holder and the biosimilar applicant identify patents that could be litigated and resolve patent disputes.
Product Approval Process Outside the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any product for which we obtain marketing approval. The federal and state fraud and abuse laws that restrict certain business practices in the biotechnology industry include but are not limited to anti-kickback and false claims statutes. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended 
to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the ACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA or the civil monetary penalties statute.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil FCA, and the federal civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free products to their customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
The federal transparency requirements under the ACA, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, as defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and, and teaching hospitals and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
HIPAA also imposes, among other things, certain standards and obligations on covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective Business Associates and subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. 
Similar state, local and foreign healthcare laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the biotechnology industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In General 
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities now and in the future could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may 
be subject to significant penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government healthcare programs, integrity oversight and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
U.S. and Foreign Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. 
HIPAA Privacy and Security Requirements. 
HIPAA imposes strict privacy, security, and breach notification obligations and standards on “covered entities” related to their use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, defined by HIPAA as PHI. Covered entities are defined under HIPAA to include healthcare providers that undertake certain electronic transmissions of PHI, such as submitting electronic claims for reimbursement for the treatment of patients. Many of our healthcare provider customers are considered to be covered entities. HIPAA also applies to Business Associates. Even though we are generally not a covered entity or a business associate in our Product related activities, HIPAA limits the amount of data including PHI that can be shared between our business and our healthcare provider customers. In certain of our activities, including our Services related activities, Revance or OPUL® also may be considered a business associate of OPUL®'s aesthetic practice customers and directly subject to HIPAA, for instance when we enter into business associate agreements with covered entities related to our Fintech Platform business, as discussed more below. We also may be subject to certain of HIPAA’s provisions as a covered entity related to our Company health plan. HIPAA is generally enforced by the OCR that can bring enforcement actions against companies that violate HIPAA’s privacy, security or breach notification rules and levy significant civil fines and/or require changes to the manner in which PHI is used and disclosed. The U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction under HIPAA to bring criminal enforcement actions against covered entities, Business Associates and possibly other entities for fraudulent misuse of PHI and other criminal acts. Further, HIPAA provides state attorneys general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. If we are in possession of PHI as a business associate or as part of our health plan covered entity and we have an unauthorized use or disclosure of the PHI, we will be required pursuant to the HIPAA breach notification rule, to notify our customer covered entity, impacted individuals, and/or OCR. 
Our aesthetic practice customers use the Fintech Platform to process personal data and PHI. Where we are determined to be a business associate of our aesthetic practice customers who are covered entities pursuant to HIPAA, the HIPAA Security and Breach Notification Rules apply directly to our business associate activities. Further, the terms of the business associate agreements we enter into with covered entities would also generally apply parts of the HIPAA Privacy Rule to our activities. 
Other Privacy and Security Requirements 
In addition to HIPAA, we may be subject to other federal and state laws that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data. 
Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices directed toward consumers. The FTC has brought aggressive enforcement actions against companies they believe have made material misrepresentations on their website or mobile app privacy statements with respect to their processing of personal data of consumers. In addition, state privacy laws include consumer protection laws that are very similar to the FTC Act and that are enforced by state attorneys general. 
Additionally, the TCPA governs the manner in which we send mobile phone marketing and commercial messages to consumers. The U.S. Federal Communication Commission enforces the TCPA, however, the TCPA includes a private right 
of action with statutory damages and there have been lawsuits brought by private plaintiffs against biopharmaceutical and medical device companies. While a 2021 Supreme Court decision narrowed the applicability of the TCPA’s restrictions, plaintiffs continue to test the boundaries of the decision, and a few states, including Florida and Oklahoma, have adopted TCPA-like laws that similarly provide for statutory damages and a private right of action. Additional states may follow suit. 
Several states, including, but not limited to, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, have adopted generally applicable and comprehensive privacy laws, although most have an exception for information regulated by HIPAA. These new and developing state laws provide a number of new privacy rights for residents of these states and impose corresponding obligations on organizations doing business in these states. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). The CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA, which took substantial effect January 1, 2023 with enforcement scheduled for July 1, 2023, expanded the CCPA. The CPRA, among other things, gives California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. Compliance with the other states’ laws will be required at different times during 2023. 
Our operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy laws with which we, our customers, and our vendors must comply. For example, European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union in certain circumstances. The processing of ‘special categories of personal data’ (such as data concerning health, biometric data used for unique identification purposes and genetic information) imposes further heightened compliance burdens under the UK GDPR and EU GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. 
Compliance with HIPAA, federal and state privacy laws and breach notification laws, the GDPR and other foreign privacy laws, and other non-harmonized laws can be costly and time consuming and failure to comply may result in significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities. These laws may also limit the use or adoption of OPUL®, and slow the pace at which we undertake our business or close sales of OPUL®, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, if our employees fail to adhere to the Company’s processes and practices for the protection and/or appropriate use of personal data or PHI, or in other ways violate privacy laws or breach notification laws, it may damage our reputation and brand. Finally, any failure by our vendors to comply with the terms of our contractual provisions or the applicable privacy laws or breach notification laws, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.
As our business continues to expand in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and as laws and regulations continue to be passed and their interpretations continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions, additional laws and regulations may become relevant to us. See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government and Industry Regulation” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Security Failures and Breach Notification Laws 
Our information technology systems, cloud-based computing services and those of our current and any future vendors, collaborators, contractors, or consultants may be subject to interruption and compromise. We and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. 
We are required to comply with laws, rules and regulations that require us to maintain the security of personal data. We may have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. In addition to the breach notification obligations under HIPAA, every state in the U.S. now has similar breach notification laws. Breach notification laws vary from state to state but upon an unauthorized access or disclosure of certain sensitive personal data, generally require notification to data subjects as well as notification in some circumstances to state agencies, such as the state attorneys general or the consumer protection bureau, and in some circumstances, notification to media. 
See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy” for additional information about our use of information technology systems and about the risks to our business associated with such information technology systems.
Medical Device Distribution 
As the distributor of Teoxane’s RHA® Collection of dermal fillers, we are required to maintain certain licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, approvals or other types of state and local permissions in order to comply with various regulations regarding the distribution of medical devices, and we are contractually obligated to cooperate with Teoxane in the event of any medical device reports (adverse events) or product recalls. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements may take many months, and may require the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions, including the revocation or suspension of licenses, registrations or accreditations, and can also subject us to plans of correction, monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive relief and/or criminal penalties. Failure to obtain state regulatory approval will also prevent distribution of products where such approval is necessary and will limit our ability to generate revenue. Maintaining the necessary compliance infrastructure to support these activities will result in increased expense.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, our ability to commercialize DAXXIFY® or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications such as cervical dystonia, adult upper limb spasticity will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that drug products have been approved for marketing by the FDA. Third-party payors also are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not obtain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for DAXXIFY® or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications, or we may be required to sell them at a discount.
We expect that third-party payors will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of DAXXIFY® in determining whether to approve reimbursement for DAXXIFY® for therapeutic indications and at what level. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement of DAXXIFY® for therapeutic indications from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the U.S.; therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, coverage under certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may not be available for certain of our product candidates. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. As a result, the coverage determination process will likely be a time-consuming and costly process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Further, coverage policies and third-
party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which the Company receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and European countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies, and so we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products, including DAXXIFY®, to other available therapies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the Company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control Company profits.
U.S. Healthcare Reform 
The ACA was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. biotechnology industry. There have been challenges by the executive, judicial and legislative branches of government to certain aspects of the ACA. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While the U.S. Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which began January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by the U.S. Congress. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, the current administration issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, on August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the current administration will impact the ACA and our business. 
In addition, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In July 2021, the current administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to the executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that the U.S. Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Further, the current administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within ninety (90) days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
U.S. Payments Regulation
Numerous laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the U.S. All Fintech Platform operations are conducted by Revance employees who are subject to the regulations and requirements described in this section. 
The Fintech Platform is currently subject to certain payments-related compliance obligations pursuant to its contractual obligations under the Payment Facilitator Agreement. These requirements relate to, among other things, operating pursuant to an anti-money laundering policy that is consistent with the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the economic sanctions regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
In addition, credit and debit card processing are subject to the Processing Rules. The Processing Rules apply to the Fintech Platform because of its contractual obligations pursuant to the Payment Facilitator Agreement. Failure to comply with the Processing Rules can result in termination of the Payment Facilitator Agreement or other key supplier agreements. Changes in the Processing Rules could also mandate material changes in how the Fintech Platform solicits new potential clients and fee structures applicable to its agreements with clients, which could result in decreased margins on services of the Fintech Platform.
Processing Rules, such as the PCI DSS of the PCI Security Standards Council establish security standards applicable to participants in payment card processing. Changes in the PCI DSS may impact the Fintech Platform’s ability to collect, store and process card data or the ability of the Fintech Platform’s suppliers to do the same for the Fintech Platform or its clients.
The Fintech Platform sends texts, emails, and other communications as a part of its services, such as when providing digital receipts, emailing customers and consumers about new features and functionality or administrative platform support such as for resetting a password. Communications laws and regulations apply to this activity in the U.S. and elsewhere, such as the TCPA and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. Compliance with such regulations may impact the Fintech Platform’s ability to communicate with practices or consumers.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and other federal, local, state, and foreign regulatory and law enforcement agencies regulate financial services and enforce consumer protection laws, including credit, deposit, and payments services, and other similar services. These agencies have broad consumer protection mandates, and they promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and regulations that affect our business. They also pursue enforcement actions, including to combat UDAAP.
We monitor developments in payments regulations and continue to develop our compliance program based on regulatory trends and changes in our risk profile.
Environment, Health and Safety 
We are voluntarily assessing and publicly reporting our greenhouse gas emissions and water usage, and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions and usage. For example, we have established employee commuter programs, evaluated the energy efficiency of our buildings and installed low-flow water fixtures. Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy-intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, and various compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties. We have implemented proactive programs to reduce and minimize the risk of hazardous materials incidents.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 534 employees, all of which are located in the U.S. Our employee base grew from 495 as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were no unions represented within our employee base. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our workforce as our company grows. 
We believe that empowered employees make a difference in our ability to execute our strategy. As such, we strive to provide an inclusive, rewarding and engaging environment for employees to develop professionally and contribute to our success. Revance was certified as a Great Place to Work® by the Great Place to Work® Institute for the fifth consecutive year in 2022.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe in equal opportunity employment and do not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital or veteran status. In addition, because we believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, in mid-2020, we formed a Diversity and Inclusion Committee, comprised of employees and led by our Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary. This committee has a mission to foster inclusivity, diversity and equity by actively educating and empowering employees to help dismantle systems of oppression, which include racism and other explicit or implicit bias at the Company and within our communities. The committee is currently working on developing a comprehensive program to strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging. As a reflection of this commitment, in 2021 and 2022, we established Company performance goals, which are also included as performance measures in the bonus program for our executive officers, tied to the achievement of specified diversity and inclusion initiatives.
As of December 31, 2022, women represented 55.4% of our workforce and 43.5% of our leadership team (defined as our management team and executive employees), and ethnic minorities represented 46% of our workforce and 40.2% of our leadership team.
Training and Talent Development
We believe that our employees are the key to our success, and we believe their development is what supports our growth and prosperity as a company. To support employee development and growth, we offer development training and workshops to all full-time employees. In addition, personal development plans for full-time employees are discussed and reviewed each year with their supervisor. We also offer an education tuition reimbursement program.
Upon joining the Company, all new employees are required to become familiar with our policies and complete compliance training, and existing employees are required to acknowledge certain policies annually.
Compensation and Benefits
Our objective is to provide our employees with a choice in quality benefits that are competitive and cost-efficient with the flexibility to meet employees’ life needs. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, an annual bonus program, an employee stock purchase plan, long-term incentive awards, rewards and recognition opportunities, an education assistance program, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, among others. We grant equity to all employees as part of our new hire compensation program and to most of our employees as part of our annual compensation programs. We are committed to fair wages and benefits for employees at all locations and use appropriate national and local external surveys to provide highly competitive wages and benefits to attract high quality talent. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to the safety of our employees and communities. We provide regular health and safety training programs for employees, which includes, upon on-boarding, an overview during new hire orientation, personal protective equipment training, ergonomics evaluation procedures and first aid training. All employees are trained on workplace safety, including security and inspection, work related injuries and emergency protocols. We also conduct special additional training for laboratory staff. 
ESG 
As our business continues to grow and develop, we are focused on building a sustainable enterprise for all of our stakeholders while making a positive impact on the communities in which we serve. In 2020, we made a formal commitment to ESG and published our inaugural ESG report in January 2021, which was guided by the SASB framework for our sector. The report outlined our ESG and corporate citizenship priorities of building a great culture, creating access to healthcare, and leading with business ethics, compliance, and strong governance. It also highlighted the progress we have made on these priorities, including enhancements to board diversity, composition and refreshment, improvements to executive compensation strategy, the formation of a diversity and inclusion committee and the completion of our first comprehensive stockholder outreach. Further, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee was designated to oversee the Company’s ESG strategy and initiatives.
Building upon our initial progress and our long-term commitment to ESG, we continued to advance our ESG program over the past year. We worked to refine our ESG framework to better align with our corporate strategy and values. Based on the results of this exercise, we developed our ESG strategy around three core areas we believe are essential to creating long-term value for our stockholders, the consumers and customers we serve, our employees upon which our success is built, and the communities in which we live and work.
•    Responsible Business: We seek to build trust with our stakeholders and identify and mitigate risks to the Company. By implementing strong corporate governance practices and clear, actionable policies, we can support product quality and safety, minimize our environmental footprint where possible, and provide stakeholders with a transparent and candid picture of our operations.
•Culture: We aspire to attract and retain a diverse and highly skilled workforce in order to foster a culture of innovation. Through efforts to ensure diversity, equality and inclusivity, we hope to empower and engage our workforce to unlock the tremendous potential of our team and its impact on the communities in which we are a part.
• Innovation and Access: We are committed to setting new standards for consumer care and injector experience while lowering the burden on the healthcare system. The cornerstone of this effort is delivering innovation to address unmet consumer and practice needs through our portfolio of products and services, including our lead drug product, DAXXIFY® for the improvement of glabellar lines, which was approved in September 2022.
In 2022, we continued our outreach to stockholders and with the benefit of their feedback, completed our first ESG materiality assessment in addition to the enhancement of certain of our corporate governance and social disclosures. We detailed these results and our continued progress on ESG in our 2022 ESG report, which we plan to publish on the “Corporate Governance” and “Sustainability” sections of our website in March 2023.
