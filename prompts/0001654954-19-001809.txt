We believe that our assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from our assumptions.

 Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in New Jersey as Creative Beauty Supply, Inc. (“Creative”) in August 1995. In March 2004, Creative acquired Global Digital Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The merger was treated as a recapitalization of Global Digital Solutions, Inc., and Creative changed its name to Global Digital Solutions, Inc. (“GDSI”). We are focused in the area of cyber arms technology and complementary security and technology solutions. On October 22, 2012, we entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization to acquire 70% of Airtronic USA, Inc. (“Airtronic”), a then debtor in possession under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code once Airtronic successfully reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy (the “Merger”). During the period from October 2012 through November 2013, we were actively involved in the day to day management of Airtronic pending the completion of the Merger. The Merger did not occur and we ceased involvement with Airtronic. In December 2012 we incorporated GDSI Florida LLC (“GDSI FL”), a Florida limited liability company. Except for the payment of administrative expenses on behalf of the Company, GDSI FL has no business operations. In January 2013 we incorporated Global Digital Solutions, LLC, a Florida limited liability company. In November 2013, we incorporated GDSI Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation. On June 16, 2014, we acquired North American Custom Specialty Vehicles, LLC into GDSI Acquisition Corporation, and changed the latter’s name to North American Custom Specialty Vehicles, Inc. (“NACSV”). In July 2014, we announced the formation of GDSI International (f/k/a Global Digital Solutions, LLC) to spearhead our efforts overseas.
 Business Overview
 
Global Digital Solutions Inc. is positioning itself as a leader in providing comprehensive security and technology solutions. Since May 1, 2012, we have been focusing on acquisitions of defense and defense-related entities both in the United States and abroad. On June 16, 2014 GDSI completed its acquisition of North American Custom Specialty Vehicles (“NACSV”). NACSV’s mobile emergency operations centers (MEOC) can be tailored to the needs of Police, Fire, EMS, Military, Homeland Security, National Guard, FBI, Air National Guard Coast Guard, Chemical/Petrochemical, Humanitarian Aid, Non-Governmental Organizations, Drug Enforcement, Immigration & Customs, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Water Management, Wildlife Management, D.O.T. Engineering & Maintenance, Air & Water Quality Management (EPA), Meteorological Seismic/Oil & Gas Exploration, IS/Mapping Power Generation (Nuclear & Conventional), Power Transmission and Strategic Infrastructure Security. The company has already built customized vehicles for customers involved in one or more of the above categories and we see many opportunities to improve NACSV and its products and services through the integration of additional software, hardware and firmware technologies.
 
We are a holding company focused on the acquisition of companies in the security and specialty vehicles and services marketplace segments. We intend to pursue these identified segments in order to expand the Company through strategic acquisitions and the controlled internal growth of such acquisitions. Since the filing of our Form 10-K for the year ending 2015, as filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 31, 2018, we have been delinquent in filing of our financial reports with the SEC pursuant to The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Since that time, the focus of our business has evolved, and the below discussion is intended to show the chronology since that time to the date of the filing of this report.
 
 History of Business – September 30, 2015 to Present
 
On May 13, 2016, as more fully discussed below, we appointed William Delgado as our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of our Board of Directors, Mr. Delgado was serving at that time as a director and our Executive Vice President in charge of our business development. He served as our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer from August 2004 to August 2013. Mr. Delgado began his career with Pacific Telephone in the Outside Plant Construction. He moved to the network engineering group and concluded his career at Pacific Bell as the Chief Budget Analyst for the Northern California region. Mr. Delgado founded All Star Telecom in late 1991, specializing in OSP construction and engineering and systems cabling. All Star Telecom was sold to International Fiber Com in April of 1999. After leaving International Fiber Com in 2002, Mr. Delgado became President/CEO of Pacific Comtel in San Diego, California. After we acquired Pacific Comtel in 2004, he became part of our management and held the positions of director, CEO, President and CFO.

 Events Since December 31, 2015:
 
The following are events that have occurred since December 31, 2015:
 
 Share Purchase and Sale Agreement for Acquisition “SPSA” of Grupo Rontan Electro Metalurgica, S.A.
 
Effective October 13, 2015, the Company (as “Purchaser”) entered into the SPSA dated October 8, 2015 with Joao Alberto Bolzan and Jose Carlos Bolzan, both Brazilian residents (collectively, the “Sellers”) and Grupo Rontan Electro Metalurgica, S.A., a limited liability company duly organized and existing under the laws of Federative Republic of Brazil (“Rontan”) (collectively, the “Parties”), pursuant to which the Sellers agreed to sell 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Rontan to the Purchaser on the closing date (the “Rontan Transaction”).
 
The purchase price consisted of a cash amount, a stock amount and an earn-out amount as follows: (i) Brazilian Real (“R”) $100 million (approximately US$26 million) to be paid by the Purchaser in equal monthly installments over a period of forty eight (48) months following the closing date; (ii) an aggregate of R$100 million (approximately US$26 million) in shares of the Purchaser’s common stock, valued at US$1.00 per share; and (iii) an earn-out payable within ten business days following receipt by the Purchaser of Rontan’s audited financial statements for the 12-months ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The earn-out shall be equal to the product of (i) Rontan’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the last 12 months, and (ii) twenty percent and is contingent upon Rontan’s EBITDA results for any earn-out period being at least 125% of Rontan’s EBITDA for the 12-months ended December 31, 2015. It is the intention of the parties that the stock amount will be used by Rontan to repay institutional debt outstanding as of the closing date.
 
Under the terms of a finder’s fee Agreement dated April 14, 2014, we have agreed to pay RLT Consulting Inc., a related party, a fee of 2% (two percent) of the transaction value, as defined in the agreement, of Rontan upon closing. The fee is payable one-half in cash and one-half in shares of our common stock. Specific conditions to closing consist of:
 
   a.)
Purchaser’s receipt of written limited assurance of an unqualified opinion with respect to Rontan’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 (the “Opinion”);

   b.)
The commitment of sufficient investment by General American Capital Partners LLC (the “Institutional Investor”), in the Purchaser following receipt of the Opinion;

   c.)
The accuracy of each parties’ representations and warranties contained in the SPSA;

   d.)
The continued operation of Rontan’s business in the ordinary course;

   e.)
The maintenance of all of Rontan’s bank credit lines in the maximum amount of R$200 million (approximately US$52 million) under the same terms and conditions originally agreed with any such financial institutions, and the maintenance of all other types of funding arrangements. As of the date of the SPSA, Rontan’s financial institution debt consists of not more than R$200 million (approximately US$52 million), trade debt of not more than R$50 million (approximately US$13 million) and other fiscal contingencies of not more that R$95 million (approximately US$24.7 million);

   f.)
Rontan shall enter into employment or consulting service agreements with key employees and advisors identified by the Purchaser, including Rontan’s Chief Executive Officer; and

   g.)
The Sellers continued guarantee of Rontan’s bank debt for a period of 90 days following issuance of the Opinion, among other items.


The Institutional Investor has committed to invest sufficient capital to facilitate the transaction, subject to receipt of the Opinion, among other conditions. Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent provided for in the SPSA, the closing date of the transaction shall take place within 10 business days from the date of issuance of the Opinion. Rontan is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of specialty vehicles and acoustic/visual signaling equipment for the industrial and automotive markets.
 
On April 1, 2016, we believed that we had satisfied or otherwise waived the conditions to closing (as disclosed under the SPSA, the closing was subject to specific conditions to closing, which were waivable by us,) and on April 1, 2016, we advised the Sellers of our intention to close the SPSA and demanded delivery of the Rontan Securities. The Sellers, however, notified us that they intend to terminate the SPSA. We believe that the Sellers had no right to terminate the SPSA and that notice of termination by the Sellers was not permitted under the terms of the SPSA.

 Officers and Directors
 
Effective May 13, 2016, we accepted the resignations of Richard J. Sullivan as our Chairman and CEO along with the resignations of Stephanie C. Sullivan and Arthur F. Noterman as directors.
 Change in Independent Accounting Firm

 Settlements of Certain Liabilities
 
On August 30, 2017, we announced that we had reached tentative agreements with three creditors for repayment of liabilities and/or claims totaling approximately $491,574 as of August 15, 2017. This settlement included amounts due under the factoring agreements discussed above during the period from August 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017. We paid approximately $193,514 to settle these liabilities and/or claims.
 
On August 30, 2017, we finalized the settlement agreement reached between the parties regarding the litigation between John Ramsay, Carl Dekle, The Estate of Brian Dekle and us and NACSV, collectively, which had been previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We made a payment of $20,000 in connection with the settlement.
 
 Litigation
 
On January 31, 2018, we announced that we initiated a lawsuit for damages against Grupo Rontan Metalurgica, S. A, (“Rontan”) and that company’s controlling shareholders, Joao Alberto Bolzan and Jose Carlos Bolzan. We have engaged the law firm of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP to represent it in this action. The case will be handled by William Isaacson of the firm’s Washington office and Carlos Sires of the firm’s Fort Lauderdale office. The action has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint alleges that Rontan is wholly-owned by Joao Bolzan and Jose Bolzan. In the complaint, we further allege that Rontan and its shareholders improperly terminated a Share Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “SPA”) by which we were to acquire whole ownership of Rontan.
 
On February 5, 2018, United States District Court Southern District of Florida filed a Pretrial Scheduling Order and Order Referring Case to Mediation dated February 5, 2018 for the Company’s lawsuit against Grupo Rontan Electro Metalurgica, S.A., et al. The Case No. is 18-80106-Civ-Middlebrooks/Brannon. The case is set for trial before U.S. District Judge Middlebrooks. The court has issued a schedule outlining various documents and responses that are to be delivered by the parties as part of the discovery plan.

On February 2, 2018, we announced that we had secured $1.2 million in a non-convertible financing from a New York-based institution.
 
 SEC Actions
 
On August 11, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Global Digital Solutions, Inc. (“GDSI”), Richard J. Sullivan (“Sullivan”) and David A. Loppert (“Loppert”) to enjoin GDSI; Sullivan, GDSI’s former Chairman and CEO; and Loppert, GDSI’s former CFO from alleged further violations of the anti-fraud and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and against Sullivan and Loppert from alleged further violations of the certification provisions of the federal securities laws.

On January 2, 2018, the Judge signed the Final Judgment as to Defendant GDSI and it was entered on the Court’s docket.
 
 Liquidity
 
Our cash position is critically deficient, and payments essential to our ability to operate are not being made in the ordinary course. Failure to raise capital to fund our operations and failure to generate positive cash flow to fund such operations in the future will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 Business Strategy – As of the Date of This Filing
 
As of the date of this filing, our business continues to be through our NACSV subsidiary and the production of mobile command centers. Our future strategy is to expand into the infrastructure technology and cybersecurity areas. We will look to acquire companies in these respective areas, focusing on companies that have the ability to utilize blockchain technology in their respective operations.
 Target Markets, Sales and Marketing
 
Our target market will be primarily in North America, with a concentration in the USA and Canada. We expect that sales and marketing will utilize the company’s existing strategies, augmented by a sales force developed by the parent company in conjunction with the acquired subsidiary.
 Competition
 
The Company is and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of other entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, private equity firms and family offices, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for the Company. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than the Company, and, consequently, the Company will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, the Company will also compete in seeking merger or acquisition candidates with numerous other small public companies.
 Research and Development
 
We have not incurred any research and development expense.
 
 Intellectual Property
 
We currently do not have any intellectual property.

 Government Approvals and Regulations
 
We do not expect to encounter any significant governmental approval or regulation issues, as we do not intend to monopolize any target business areas. We do expect to be subject to the traditional government regulation related to business licenses, foreign corporation rules, etc.
 Subsidiaries
 
We currently have two subsidiaries including GSDI Florida, LLC and North American Custom Specialty Vehicles, Inc.
 
 Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had eight full-time employees and two part-time employees. We intend to hire additional staff and to engage consultants in general administration on an as-needed basis. We also intend to engage experts in operations, finance and general business to advise us in various capacities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good to excellent.
 
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, marketing, and management personnel and, as of the end of the period covered by this report and as of the date of filing, we continue to rely on the services of independent contractors for much of our sales/marketing. We believe technical, accounting and other functions are also critical to our continued and future success.
