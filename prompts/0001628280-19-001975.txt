Item 1. | Business

General

Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida (“Seacoast” or the “Company”) is a financial holding company, incorporated in Florida in 1983, and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). Our principal subsidiary is Seacoast National Bank, a national banking association (“Seacoast Bank”). Seacoast Bank commenced its operations in 1933, and operated as “First National Bank & Trust Company of the Treasure Coast” prior to 2006 when we changed its name to “Seacoast National Bank.”

As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s legal structure includes one domestic subsidiary bank, Seacoast Bank, which has four wholly owned subsidiaries and seven trusts formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. Seacoast coordinates the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and maintains financial, operational and administrative systems that allow centralized evaluation of subsidiary operations and coordination of selected policies and activities. 
As of December 31, 2018, Seacoast had total consolidated assets of approximately $6.7 billion, total deposits of approximately $5.2 billion, total consolidated liabilities, including deposits, of approximately $5.9 billion and consolidated shareholders’ equity of approximately $864.3 million. Our operations are discussed in more detail under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Our principal offices are located at 815 Colorado Avenue, Stuart, Florida 34994, and the telephone number at that address is (772) 287-4000. We and our subsidiary Seacoast Bank maintain Internet websites at www.seacoastbanking.com and www.seacoastbank.com, respectively. We are not incorporating the information on our or Seacoast Bank’s website into this report, and neither of these websites nor the information appearing on these websites is included or incorporated in, or is a part of, this report.

We make available, free of charge on our corporate website, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC.

Expansion of Market, Products and Services

Seacoast has grown to be one of the largest community banks headquartered in Florida. This growth has been achieved through a balanced strategy consisting of organic growth and acquisitions focused on the state's most attractive MSAs. Seacoast provides integrated financial services including commercial and retail banking, wealth management, treasury management and home mortgage products through the Company's network of 51 traditional branches of its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Seacoast Bank, and seven commercial banking centers. Offices stretch from Ft. Lauderdale, Boca Raton and West Palm Beach north through the Daytona Beach area, into Orlando and Central Florida and the adjacent Tampa market, and west to Okeechobee and surrounding counties. Seacoast customers can also access their account information and perform transactions online, through mobile applications, or through our telephone customer support center, which offers extended hours. These options combined with our traditional branch footprint allows us to meet a broad range of customer needs.
During 2018, the Company continued to make enhancements to its customer analytics platforms which equip our bankers with the tools to analyze our customers needs, resulting in an enhanced customer experience and improved banker efficiency. The 
5

Company has also made investments in its new loan origination platforms which streamline the underwriting and approval process. Seacoast has continued to expand its digital offerings to customers designed to improve the customer experience and lower the cost to serve. As more customers adopt these channels, transactions have shifted from the traditional branch network to digital banking. This combination allows Seacoast to serve the ever changing needs of its customer base. Seacoast Bank also provides brokerage and annuity services. Seacoast Bank personnel managing the sale of these services are dual employees with LPL Financial, the company through which Seacoast Bank presently conducts its brokerage and annuity services. In 2018, the Company established Seacoast Insurance Services, Inc., providing our customers with access to a range of insurance products. 
In the fourth quarter, Seacoast completed the acquisition of First Green Bancorp, Inc. headquartered in central Florida. This acquisition enhanced Seacoast's presence in the Orlando and Fort Lauderdale MSAs, two of the strongest and fastest growing economies in Florida. 
 Employees

As of December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 902 full-time equivalent employees. The Company considers its employee relations to be favorable, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any employees.
Seasonality; Cycles

We believe our commercial banking operations are somewhat seasonal in nature. Investment management fees and deposits often peak in the first and second quarters, and often are lowest in the third quarter. Transactional fees from merchants, and ATM and debit card use also typically peak in the first and second quarters. Public deposits tend to increase with tax collections in the first and fourth quarters and decline as a result of spending thereafter. Commercial and residential real estate activity, demand, prices and sales volumes are less seasonal and vary based upon various factors, including economic conditions, interest rates and credit availability.
Competition

Seacoast operates in a highly competitive market. Its competitors include other banks, credit unions, mortgage companies, personal and commercial financing companies, investment brokerage and advisory firms, mutual fund companies and insurance companies. These competitors range in both size and geographic footprint. Seacoast operates primarily in Florida from Ft. Lauderdale, Boca Raton and West Palm Beach north through the Daytona Beach area, into Orlando and Central Florida and the adjacent Tampa market, and west to Okeechobee and surrounding counties. Seacoast Bank's competition includes not only other banks of comparable or larger size in its markets, but also various other nonbank financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, personal and commercial financial companies, peer to peer lending businesses, investment brokerage and financial advisory firms and mutual fund companies. We compete for deposits, commercial, fiduciary and investment services and various types of loans and other financial services. Seacoast Bank also competes for interest-bearing funds with a number of other financial intermediaries, including brokerage and insurance firms, as well as investment alternatives, including mutual funds, governmental and corporate bonds, and other securities. Continued consolidation and rapid technological changes within the financial services industry will most likely continue to change the nature and intensity of competition that we face, but also creates opportunities for us to demonstrate and leverage what we believe are our competitive advantages. 
Our competitors include not only financial institutions based in the State of Florida, but also a number of large out-of-state and foreign banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions that have an established market presence in the State of Florida, or that offer products by mail, telephone or online. Many of our competitors are engaged in local, regional, national and international operations and have greater assets, personnel and other resources. Some of these competitors are subject to less regulation and/or more favorable tax treatment than we are subject to. Many of these institutions have greater resources, broader geographic markets and higher lending limits than us and may offer services that we do not offer. In addition, these institutions may be able to better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services, and electronic and other technology than we do. To offset these potential competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation for superior service, ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly, and the delivery of an integrated distribution of traditional branches and bankers, with digital technology.
Supervision and Regulation

We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The following is a brief summary that does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description 
6

of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company’s and Seacoast Bank’s business. In addition, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us and Seacoast Bank, are difficult to predict. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or Seacoast Bank. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or their interpretation by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on our and Seacoast Bank’s business, operations, and earnings. Supervision and regulation of banks, their holding companies and affiliates is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than holders of our capital stock.
Regulation of the Company
We are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and have elected to be a financial holding company. As such, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects financial holding companies, such as the Company, to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.
Activity Limitations: As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company. Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or complementary to financial activities. We and Seacoast Bank must each remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” and Seacoast Bank must receive a Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) rating of at least “Satisfactory” at its most recent examination in order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a financial holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that financial holding company. As further described below, each of the Company and Seacoast Bank is well-capitalized as of December 31, 2018, and Seacoast Bank has a rating of “Outstanding” in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Source of Strength Obligations: A financial holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as Seacoast Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of Seacoast Bank, this agency is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”)) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements and require us to provide financial assistance to Seacoast Bank in the event of financial distress. 
Acquisitions: The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Florida or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentages, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combating money laundering.
7

Change in Control: Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, and the OCC before acquiring control of any national bank, such as Seacoast Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding company’s or bank’s voting stock, or if one or more other control factors are present. As a result, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock. 
Governance and Financial Reporting Obligations: We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”), and NASDAQ. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the value of our securities. The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2018 are included in this report under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.”
Corporate Governance:  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) addresses many investor protection, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act: (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers.
Incentive Compensation: The Dodd-Frank Act requires the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and Seacoast Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the Federal Reserve and the OCC also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2018, these rules have not been implemented. We and Seacoast Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles: that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance.
Shareholder Say-On-Pay Votes: The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to provide shareholders with an advisory vote on executive compensation (known as say-on-pay votes), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on say-on-pay proposals at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. The first say-on-pay vote occurred at our 2011 annual shareholders meeting. The say-on-pay, the say-on-parachute and the say-on-frequency votes are advisory and explicitly nonbinding and cannot override a decision of our board of directors.
Other Regulatory Matters: We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (“FINRA”), the PCAOB, NASDAQ and various state securities regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.
Capital Requirements
The Company and Seacoast Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the Federal Reserve 
8

and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.
The Company and Seacoast Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. 
The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%.
In addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. This capital conservation buffer is being phased in, and was 1.875% as of January 1, 2018 and is 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. 
Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company’s or Seacoast Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. All of the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels for federally insured depository institutions. 
To be well-capitalized, Seacoast Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:

• | 6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;


• | 8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;


• | 10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and


• | 5.0% leverage ratio.

The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater 
9

to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to Seacoast Bank, the Company’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2018 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. 
The Company’s and Seacoast Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer as of December 31, 2018. Based on current estimates, we believe that the Company and Seacoast Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer.  As of December 31, 2018, the consolidated capital ratios of Seacoast and Seacoast Bank were as follows:

 | Seacoast(Consolidated) | | SeacoastBank | | Minimum to beWell-Capitalized(1)
Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | 14.43 | % | | 13.60 | % | 10.0 | %
Tier 1 Capital Ratio | 13.80 | % | | 12.97 | % | 8.0 | %
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1) | 12.43 | % | | 12.97 | % | 6.5 | %
Leverage Ratio | 11.16 | % | | 10.49 | % | 5.0 | %
(1)For subsidiary bank only | | | | | | | 


On November 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a proposed rule to simplify the regulatory capital requirements for eligible banks and holding companies with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets that opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”) framework, as required by Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”). The Regulatory Relief Act mandates that the banking agencies develop a CBLR of not less than 8% and not more than 10% for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking organization that exceeds the CBLR threshold would be exempt from the agencies’ current capital framework, including the risk-based capital requirements and capital conservation buffer described above, and would be deemed well-capitalized under the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations. The Regulatory Relief Act defines a “qualifying community banking organization” as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Under the proposed rule, if a qualifying community banking organization elects to use the CBLR framework, it will be considered “well-capitalized” so long as its CBLR is greater than 9%. The agencies are expected to issue a final rule in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this proposed rule. 
On December 21, 2018, federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming implementation of the “current expected credit losses” (“CECL”) accounting standard under GAAP; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, which introduced CECL as the methodology to replace the current “incurred loss” methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and changed the approaches for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets. Under the incurred loss methodology, credit losses are recognized only when the losses are probable or have been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This change will result in earlier recognition of credit losses that the Company deems expected but not yet probable. For SEC reporting companies with December 31 fiscal-year ends, such as the Company, CECL will become effective beginning with the first quarter of 2020. 
Payment of Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from Seacoast Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from Seacoast Bank. The prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank (such as Seacoast Bank) in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits any national bank from paying dividends that would be greater than such bank’s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debts in excess of such bank’s allowance for possible loan losses.
In addition, the Company and Seacoast Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate 
10

federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have each indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:

• | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;


• | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or


• | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

Seacoast Bank recorded net income in 2018, 2017, and 2016, but no dividends were paid to us during any of these years. Prior approval by the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank’s profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. Under this restriction Seacoast Bank is eligible to distribute dividends up to $134.5 million to the Holding Company, without prior OCC approval, as of December 31, 2018.

No dividends on our common stock were declared or paid in 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Regulation of the Bank
As a national bank, our primary bank subsidiary, Seacoast Bank, is subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the OCC and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. The deposits of Seacoast Bank are insured by the FDIC and, accordingly, the bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC has backup examination authority and certain enforcement powers over Seacoast Bank.  Seacoast Bank also is subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations.  
In addition, as discussed in more detail below, Seacoast Bank and any other of our subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products and services are subject to regulation and potential supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Authority to supervise and examine the Company and Seacoast Bank for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also may participate in examinations of our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain federal consumer financial protection rules adopted by the CFPB.
Broadly, regulations applicable to Seacoast Bank include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital and liquidity ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit; requirements to maintain reserves against deposits and loans; limitations on the types of investments that may be made by Seacoast Bank; and requirements governing risk management practices. Seacoast Bank is permitted under federal law to open a branch on a de novo basis across state lines where the laws of that state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch. 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders: Seacoast Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between Seacoast Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are limited to 10% of Seacoast Bank’s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between Seacoast Bank and the Company and all of its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20% of Seacoast Bank’s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from Seacoast Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible 
11

collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between Seacoast Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm’s length basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as Seacoast Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.

Reserves: Federal Reserve rules require depository institutions, such as Seacoast Bank, to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily interest bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts. For 2019, the first $16.3 million of covered balances are exempt from these reserve requirements, aggregate balances between $16.3 million and $124.2 million are subject to a 3% reserve requirement, and aggregate balances above $124.2 million are subject to a reserve requirement of $3,237,000 plus 10% of the amount over $124.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
FDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference: Seacoast Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC’s DIF up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set at $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. Seacoast Bank is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance. The FDIC calculates quarterly deposit insurance assessments based on an institution’s average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity, and applies one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels, supervisory ratings, and certain other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. As of September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Seacoast Bank’s rate was 3.37 basis points, 4.38 basis points, and 5.06 basis points, respectively. Seacoast Bank’s deposit insurance premiums totaled $2.2 million for 2018, $2.3 million for 2017, and $2.4 million for 2016. Our FICO assessment averaged 0.31 basis points for all four quarters during 2018. On September 30, 2018, the FDIC announced that the designated reserve ratio (“DRR”) of the DIF reached 1.36 percent, exceeding the required 1.35 percent, two years ahead of the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Though the FDIC has clarified that assessment rates will not change in the immediate future, banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as Seacoast Bank, will start receiving credits against their deposit insurance assessments when the DRR reaches or exceeds 1.38 percent. In addition, Seacoast Bank is subject to quarterly assessments by the FDIC to pay interest on Financing Corporation (“FICO”) bonds. Our FICO assessment rate for the first quarter of 2019 is 0.14 basis points. The FDIC has announced that the remaining FICO bonds are expected to mature in September 2019, and that the final FICO assessment is expected to be made in March 2019 (at a rate of 0.14 (annual) basis points).
Deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.    
Standards for Safety and Soundness: The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.

Anti-Money Laundering: The International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Funding Act of 2001 specifies “know your customer” requirements that obligate financial institutions to take actions to verify the identity of the account holders in connection with opening an account at any U.S. financial institution. Banking regulators will consider compliance with the Act’s money laundering provisions in acting upon acquisition and merger proposals. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations. Sanctions for violations of the Act can be imposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to $1 million. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (“USA PATRIOT”) Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. The USA PATRIOT Act, and its implementing regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs with minimum standards that include:
12


• | the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls;


• | the designation of a compliance officer;


• | an ongoing employee training program; and


• | an independent audit function to test the programs.

Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing “cease and desist” and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements. In addition, FinCEN issued rules that became effective on May 11, 2018, that require, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions, covered financial institutions to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers.
Economic Sanctions: The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.
Concentrations in Lending: During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “Guidance”) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either:

• | Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total risk based capital; or


• | Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300% or more of a bank’s total risk based capital.

The Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type. We have always had exposures to loans secured by commercial real estate due to the nature of our markets and the loan needs of both our retail and commercial customers. We believe our long term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, are generally appropriate to managing our concentrations as required under the Guidance. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding $251.5 million in commercial construction and residential land development loans and $192.1 million in residential construction loans to individuals, which represents approximately 63% of Seacoast Bank’s total risk based capital at December 31, 2018, well below the Guidance’s threshold. At December 31, 2018, the total CRE exposure for Seacoast Bank represents approximately 227% of total risk based capital, also below the Guidance’s threshold.
Community Reinvestment Act: Seacoast Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The OCC’s assessment of Seacoast Bank’s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company. Following the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company is not permitted to become or remain a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under GLB may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries receive less than a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its latest CRA examination. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. On April 3, 2018, the Department of the Treasury published recommendations for amending the regulations implementing the CRA; on August 28, 2018, the OCC issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking seeking industry comment on how the CRA might be modernized. Seacoast Bank has a rating of “Outstanding” in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Privacy and Data Security:  The GLB generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB. The GLB also directs federal regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. Seacoast Bank is subject to such standards, 
13

as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach. Under federal law, Seacoast Bank must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit customers to opt out of having nonpublic customer information disclosed to third parties in certain circumstances, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. We are similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused.
Consumer Regulation:  Activities of Seacoast Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:

• | limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Seacoast Bank, including new rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;


• | govern Seacoast Bank’s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | require Seacoast Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | prohibit Seacoast Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit;


• | govern the manner in which Seacoast Bank may collect consumer debts; and


• | prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services.

Mortgage Regulation: The CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “ATR/QM rule”), which requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance “safe harbor” for lenders that issue certain “qualified mortgages.” The ATR/QM rule defines a “qualified mortgage” to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibits loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%. While “qualified mortgages” will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to “qualified mortgages” that are “higher priced mortgages” (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as “qualified residential mortgages.” 
The CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) as well as integrated mortgage disclosure rules. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower’s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers’ applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts.
Non-Discrimination Policies: Seacoast Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the “ECOA”) and the Fair Housing Act (the “FHA”), both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA.
