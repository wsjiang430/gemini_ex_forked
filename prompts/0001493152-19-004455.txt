Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Balance Labs, Inc. was incorporated on June 5, 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a consulting firm that provides business development and consulting services to startup and development-stage businesses. With each client, our company provides businesses in various industries with customized consulting services to meet their business needs and help them improve their business models, sales and marketing plans and internal operations, as well as introduce the businesses to experienced professional contacts that would be vital to the success of these businesses.
 
The Company is led by our President, CEO, CFO and Chairman of the Board, Michael D. Farkas, who is a seasoned entrepreneur and has worked in corporate finance and in assisting and developing businesses in multiple industries for the past twenty-five (25) years. Along with Mr. Farkas, our management team consists of experienced business people in high-tech fields such as telecommunications, EV Charging infrastructure, laser technology, E-Cig and Vapor as well as the agricultural industry, specifically in the cultivation of olives and production of olive oil. Throughout the years while working with various companies, our management team recognized the need for an independent third party company that could help developmental stage and startup businesses create and implement a viable business model, assist them in developing marketing, promotional and merchandising plans.

Our business focuses on providing advice to entrepreneurs and assisting business owners so that their ideas can be fully developed and implemented. Due to limited resources, lack of experienced management and competing priorities, startup and developmental stage companies are not operating as efficiently as they can be, and therefore would benefit from an outside party that could assist in developing and executing certain strategies. We utilize our knowledge in developing businesses, share practical experiences with our clients and introduce the business owners to different experienced professionals who could help these inexperienced entrepreneurs further implement their ideas. Startups and development stage businesses across all industries commonly experience certain “growing pains”. Our plan is to prepare our clients for many inevitable challenges and develop a customized plan for them to overcome these obstacles so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) and/or service(s) to their potential customers.

Target Market
 
The target market will consist of startup and developmental stage businesses located in the United States and abroad. We cater our services to startups and developmental stage companies that do not have the resources to execute or implement their business plan or ideas with the personnel in-house. Our client companies can derive value from our support and expertise with dealing with the typical growing pains and common mistakes experienced by startups.
Marketing and Sales


We are starting to become more active in the market by developing relationships initially with startups and development stage companies. In addition to personal relationships of the principals, we plan to use our website www.balancelabs.co to promote our services and provide a contact function that allows potential clients to reach us for additional information. We may also utilize social media such as Facebook, Twitter and an online blog to increase our presence online and communicate the value we can add.
 
We do not have any specific marketing channels in place at this point to market our services to potential customers. In the next twelve months we plan to market our services through word of mouth or personal referrals. We also plan to advertise in startup and development stage specific journals and online media. Referrals from companies that are satisfied with our provided services are likely to be our most significant and efficient form of marketing.

Competition
 
The primary source of competition will come from various service providers such as business plan writers, auditors, lawyers, marketing firms as well as many other types of service providers. In addition, those startups and development stage companies that have the resources and inclination to handle these tasks in-house will not need our services.
 
There are also numerous established firms that offer some combination of marketing, promotional and general consulting services to startup and development stage companies in the industry. In addition, there are a number of large and well-established general marketing agencies that provide strategy and implementation services to the industry as well as a number of other industries. We are in a very competitive market and may struggle to differentiate ourselves as a specialist that provides more value for startup and development stage companies.
 
Services Pricing
 
The cost for consulting projects will depend on the scope of the project and time required to execute it. We may charge a flat fee based on the services that our clients request from us, an hourly rate, revenue share or a combination of the above in order to provide our clients with as many cost effective options as possible. Additionally, all expenses incurred, including engaging third parties, travel as well as other approved expenses, will be passed through to the client for reimbursements.
Employees
 
We presently have no other employees other than our President, CEO and CFO, Michael Farkas, Secretary, Carmen Villegas, Controller, Robert Wolf and Paralegal, Yechiel Baron. Over time, we may hire employees and/or engage additional independent contractors in order to execute our projects. These decisions will be made by our officers if and when appropriate.
Government Regulation
 
Our business activities currently are subject to no particular regulation by government agencies other than that routinely imposed on corporate businesses. We do not anticipate any regulations specific to our business activities in the future.
Seasonality
 
We do not have a seasonal business cycle.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our business currently does not implicate any environmental regulation.
