ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Marizyme is a multi-technology biomedical company dedicated to the accelerated development and commercialization of medical technologies that improve patient health outcomes.
 
Currently, we are focused on developing three medical technology products – DuraGraft®, MATLOCTM and Krillase® – each of which is backed by a portfolio of patented or patent-pending assets. DuraGraft is a single-use intraoperative vascular graft treatment that protects against ischemic injury and reduces the incidence and complications of graft failure, therefore maintaining endothelial function and structure while improving clinical outcomes. MATLOC is a point-of-care, lab-on-chip digital screening and diagnostic device platform, initially being developed for quantitative chronic kidney disease, or CKD, assessment. Our Krillase protein enzyme provides a therapeutics opportunity for wound healing, thrombosis, and pet health.

 three principal medical technologies – DuraGraft®, MATLOCTM and Krillase® – are expected to serve an unmet significant market need in several areas, including, cardiac surgery, CKD, and pet health. We are currently preparing DuraGraft, our endothelial damage inhibitor, or EDI, for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, De Novo classification process. We filed a pre-submission letter for DuraGraft with the FDA in November 2021 and we submitted the De Novo request for DuraGraft to the FDA in January 2023. Upon receiving FDA approval of DuraGraft, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, we expect to quickly commercialize the product and build revenue rapidly utilizing multiple strategic partners and revenue channels. With our DuraGraft, MATLOC and Krillase technologies, we have the potential to bring three FDA-approved products to market.
 
For 2023, our primary business priority is achieving FDA approval of DuraGraft as a medical device for coronary bypass artery graft, or CABG, procedures, through the De Novo classification request process. Following FDA approval of DuraGraft, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, we expect to begin to distribute and sell DuraGraft in the United States through the efforts of a strategic partner. If we are not able to find an appropriate strategic partner, we will have to build our own marketing and sales capabilities at a significant cost to us and with no guarantee of success. DuraGraft first received its CE marking in August 2014. CE marking signifies that DuraGraft may be sold in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and DuraGraft has therefore been assessed as meeting EEA safety, health, and environmental protection requirements. We will continue marketing efforts in Europe and in other countries that accept CE marking. In addition, we intend to fully develop and market DuraGraft in the U.S. for fat grafting procedures in plastic surgery procedures.
 
In 2023, we also intend to continue the advancement of our MATLOC CKD point-of-care device, mainly through the development of our lab-on-chip technology under a Sponsored Research Agreement, or SRA. An SRA is an agreement (which may be classified as a grant, contract or cooperative agreement) under which one party (the “Sponsor”) provides funding to a second party to support the performance of a specified research project or related activity. The Sponsor may be a foundation, government agency, for-profit entity, research institute, or another university.
 
As we achieve FDA approvals, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, we intend to prioritize the commercialization of our DuraGraft, MATLOC and Krillase platform products through multiple distribution and marketing channels in the U.S. We expect that once we enter the commercialization phase, we will be able to rapidly generate revenue growth. Additionally, in the near term we expect to generate revenue from the sale of DuraGraft through the expansion of our international marketing efforts by our distribution partners.
 
On February 14, 2022, Marizyme filed the initial registration statement on Form S-1 relating to the Company’s proposed public offering. As of March 24, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) had not declared the registration statement effective, the final prospectus had not been filed, and the common stock had not been approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The offering is contingent upon the listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. There is no guarantee or assurance that our securities will be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Any proceeds from the offering will be used by the Company (i) to develop its DuraGraft, MATLOC, and Krillase platforms; (ii) to commercialize and produce its products, (iii) repayment of indebtedness used for working capital consisting of principal and accrued interest outstanding under a Promissory Note issued to Hexin Global Ltd. (“Hexin”) on December 28, 2022 for the principal amount of $750,000 bearing interest at the annual rate of 20% per annum, due June 28, 2023 (the “December 2022 Promissory Note”) and an Unsecured Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note issued to Walleye Opportunities Master Fund Ltd (“Walleye”) on February 6, 2023 for the principal amount of $1,000,000, bearing no interest, due May 7, 2023, which principal amount will increase to $1,250,000 if not repaid by such date (the “February 2023 Promissory Note”), and (iv) for general working capital and other corporate purposes. As of March 24, 2023, management anticipates, but cannot guarantee, that the offering will close in the second quarter of 2023.
 
Our Corporate History and Structure
 
We are a Nevada corporation originally incorporated on March 20, 2007. From 2007 to early 2018, we operated under a number of different names with different management teams and in different industries. We changed our name to Marizyme, Inc. on March 21, 2018, to reflect our new life science focus, and at that time we also changed our common stock ticker symbol to “MRZM.”
 
In September 2018, we acquired the Krillase platform from ACB Holding AB; in July 2020, we acquired from Somahlution LLC and its related companies, which we refer to together as Somahlution, all of the assets of Somahlution (the “Somahlution Assets”), including DuraGraft; and in December 2021, we acquired My Health Logic from Health Logic Interactive Inc. (“HLII”). In connection with our My Health Logic acquisition, David Barthel, former chief executive officer of HLII and My Health Logic, became our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors; George Kovalyov, previously the chief operating officer and a director of HLII, became our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Harrison Ross, previously the Chief Financial Officer of HLII, became our Vice President of Finance.
 
Our Products
 
DuraGraft®
 
Through our acquisition of the Somahlution Assets in July 2020, we acquired key intellectual products based on a patent protected cytoprotective platform technology designed to reduce ischemic injury to organs and tissues in grafting and transplantation surgeries. These assets include DuraGraft, a single-use intraoperative vascular graft treatment, that is able to protect endothelial cells from ischemic damage and reperfusion injury, and reduce complications associated with vein graft failure, or VGF, post-CABG procedures, thereby reducing major adverse cardiac events such as repeat revascularization and myocardial infarction, reducing incidence and complications of graft failure, and improving clinical outcomes.
 
DuraGraft is an endothelial damage inhibitor, or EDI, indicated for cardiac bypass, peripheral bypass, and other vascular surgeries. It carries CE marking and is approved for marketing in 34 countries outside the United States on three continents, including all countries in the European Union such as Spain, Austria, Ireland, and Germany, as well as countries outside the European Union such as Turkey, Switzerland, Chile, and the Philippines. Somahlution had also been focused on developing products to mitigate the effects of ischemia reperfusion injury in other grafting and transplantation surgeries and other indications in which ischemic injury can cause disease. Now, under our ownership, multiple products derived from the cytoprotective platform technology for several indications are under various stages of development.

The chart below displays the problems DuraGraft has been designed to address and the solutions it can provide.



Problems: Endothelial damage; Vein Graft Disease; Vein Graft Failure ● Intraoperative graft damage in is a principal cause of VGF. The durability and patency of vein grafts are significantly compromised by vein graft disease, or VGD: ◌ VGD process begins with endothelial damage that occurs during the grafting surgery itself. ◌ VGD encompasses the pathophysiological changes that occur in vein grafts following their use in surgical grafting. ● Endothelial damage, manifested within minutes as pro-inflammatory and pro- thrombogenic changes within the graft, leads to VGD and VGF. ● As VGD progresses, vein grafts lose their ability to adapt to the environment, leading to: ◌ thrombus formation, ◌ intimal hyperplasia, or ◌ atherosclerosis. ● These may result in: ◌ graft stenosis, ◌ occlusion, ◌ loss of graft patency, or ◌ Ischemic Reperfusion Injury (IRI), i.e., tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to tissue (re- + perfusion) after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen. ● VGD that progresses to VGF may result in myocardial infarction and the need for repeat revascularization. The success rate of revascularization or re-intervention of a failed graft is very poor. Therefore, addressing early VGD in the primary graft is crucial. | Solutions: DuraGraft is designed to reduce graft failure ■ DuraGraft is a single-use intraoperative vascular graft treatment that maintains endothelial cell function and structure, reducing the incidence and complications associated with graft failure, thereby improving clinical outcomes. ■ DuraGraft improves clinical outcomes by providing a pH balanced and buffered environment which protects against intraoperative ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI). ■ DuraGraft is: ◌ pH balanced, unlike Heparinized saline and autologous blood, which are not pH-balanced; ◌ ionically balanced, which is critical in maintaining cell osmolarity and membrane integrity; and ◌ formulated to support the viability and health of the graft post-grafting by including L-Arginine to support synthesis of nitric oxide during the ischemic period. ■ DuraGraft also protects against the two main causes of IRI – oxidative damage and metabolic stress – by: ◌ having two stabilized potent antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbic acid) that neutralize the reactive oxygen species, which cause oxidative damage during ischemia; and ◌ containing components (glucose and high energy phosphates) that support anaerobic metabolism during ischemia, thereby reducing the generation of metabolic stress lesions. ■ DuraGraft is proven to reduce clinical complications (MI, Repeat Revascularization, and MACE) associated with VGF, with statistical significance. ■ DuraGraft is approved for marketing in 34 countries, not including the U.S., for maintaining free arterial and venous vascular grafts.

According to market analysis reports, the size of the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures market globally was approximately $16.7 billion as of 2020 (Expert Markets Research, 2020). This market is forecast to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.5% between 2021 and 2026 (Expert Markets Research, 2020). Globally, it is estimated that approximately 800,000 CABG procedures are performed each year (Grand View Research, March 2017), with procedures performed in the U.S. being a substantial percentage of the total global procedures performed. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 340,000 CABG surgeries are performed each year.
 
For 2023, our main business priority is receiving FDA approval of DuraGraft for CABG procedures through a De Novo classification request. We also plan to finalize the development of a DuraGraft powder formulation for fat grafting procedures for plastic surgeries in the U.S. It is reported that 22.4 million such surgeries take place annually in the U.S. (American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 2020). We expect our De Novo application will present a robust propensity score-based matched comparison of subjects who have undergone isolated CABG in Europe utilizing DuraGraft and whose data has been compiled in the DuraGraft Registry compared to a matched cohort drawn from the STS Registry receiving standard of care treatment. Propensity scores will be estimated based on a set of 23 characteristics all demonstrated to be independently associated with mortality up to one year after CABG surgery. We believe that this approach will (i) yield a valid and robust comparison of outcomes derived from the use of DuraGraft, as recorded in the DuraGraft Registry, and standard of care as represented by outcomes observed in the STS Registry, and (ii) lead to FDA approval for DuraGraft as an EDI.
 
In anticipation of the filing of the De Novo request for DuraGraft, we submitted a pre-submission document to the FDA in November 2021 that describes the strategy for demonstrating the clinical safety and efficacy of DuraGraft. We submitted the De Novo request to the FDA in January 2023.
 
Following the FDA approval of DuraGraft, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, we intend to strive for rapid international revenue growth from sales of DuraGraft using multiple strategic partners and revenue channels. In the U.S. marketplace, we will seek to commercialize and develop additional applications including, but not limited to, fat grafting for plastic surgery. We intend to enter into a commercialization arrangement with a strategic partner who will be responsible for the marketing and sales of DuraGraft. In Europe and elsewhere, we will continue our DuraGraft marketing efforts relying on our DuraGraft CE marking and our distribution partners. The CE marking signifies that DuraGraft may be sold in the EEA and that DuraGraft has been assessed as meeting safety, health, and environmental protection requirements. We are currently working with local distributors of cardiovascular disease-related products, in accordance with local regulatory requirements, to sell and increase the market share of DuraGraft in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Chile, and Turkey, among others. In all of our markets, we expect that we will market DuraGraft through multiple distribution partners with a focus on sales to cardiac surgeons and cardiologists. If we are not able to find appropriate strategic and distribution partners or our partners are unable to achieve our sales goals, we will have to build our own marketing and sales capabilities, which we expect would be time-consuming and costly.

Marketing DuraGraft
 
Our DuraGraft commercialization plan using its CE marking and existing distribution partners in select European and Asian countries resumed in the second quarter of 2022, with a targeted approach based on market access, existing known opinion leaders, or KOLs, clinical data and revenue penetration. We will also begin, once we receive FDA approval, the process of developing the U.S. CABG market for DuraGraft with select clinical studies, the development of KOLs, the promotion of existing publications, digital marketing, and multiple sales channels.

MATLOC 1TM
 
On December 22, 2021, we acquired My Health Logic, its lab-on-chip technology platform and its patient-centric, digital point-of-care screening device, MATLOC 1.
 
The excitement over microfluidics, also known as lab-on-a-chip technology, lies in its potential for producing revolutionary, timely, accessible, and practical point-of-care devices; devices that are patient-centric (one-to-many, rather than doctor centric, one-to-one) and support self-care and independence. Microfluidics is a technology for analyzing small volumes of fluids, with the potential to miniaturize complex laboratory procedures onto a small microchip, hence the term “lab-on-chip”.
 
Marizyme’s lab-on-chip technology is currently being developed for screening and diagnosis related to the three leading biomarkers for chronic kidney disease, a disease estimated to affect 37 million Americans - or one out of every seven people (National Kidney Foundation, 2019). If left untreated, many patients will advance to end stage renal disease (ESRD), often leading to kidney transplant, renal failure, or dialysis. Since 90% of those with CKD do not know they have it, the risk of progression in the disease is high and this creates massive burdens for CKD patients and healthcare systems (National Kidney Foundation, 2019). CKD and ESRD costs the U.S. public healthcare systems hundreds of billions of dollars a year. In 2018 Medicare alone spent $130 billion on CKD and ESRD-related costs (National Kidney Foundation, 2019). With the increase of diabetics and hypertension cases in the U.S., which make up roughly two-thirds of all CKD patients (National Kidney Foundation, 2022), CKD related healthcare costs are expected to increase significantly. Compounding this development is the fact that less than 50% of diabetic patients, the highest at-risk group, are annually screened or tested for CKD (Mayo Clinic Proceedings, 2021). This creates an unmet need for point-of-care technologies that facilitate CKD screening and diagnosis, which further facilitates earlier screening and diagnosis and detection to slow down or eliminate the CKD progression. By combining lab-on-chip technology with Marizyme’s MATLOC 1 device, it will be able to quantitatively read the two urine biomarkers, albumin and creatine, necessary for effective CKD screening at point-of-care with results available instantly on a patient’s smartphone.
 

* This illustration reflects management’s current expectations and is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. See “Part I. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
 
MATLOC 2, the Company’s next-generation point-of-care device in development, is designed to provide a fully integrated, quantitative diagnostic assessment of estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, using a blood-based biomarker. eGFR is a key measure of kidney function health and/or stage of kidney disease and our MATLOC 2 device is designed to provide a fully integrated, complete diagnostic assessment for CKD, potentially eliminating the need for lab visits and in-person assessment.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the ongoing transformation in healthcare. Connected consumer electronic devices are enabling 24/7 home-based digital healthcare. We believe that consumers have the desire and are now becoming empowered to manage their own healthcare and that they will seek to utilize our point-of-care MATLOC 1 device.
 
With our lab-on-chip technology and MATLOC 1 device in development, we are striving to achieve earlier detection and slowing of the progression of CKD, allowing patients and healthcare systems to reduce the enormous costs of kidney failure, transplant, and/or dialysis. After completing the technology for CKD assessment, we plan to explore the commercial potential of other biomarkers for chronic diseases to be measured at point-of-care.
 
MATLOC 1, upon FDA approval, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, is expected to be marketed and sold through an experienced medical device distribution partner network with a focus on nephrologists in hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and private practices, to better assess patients and slow the progression of CKD.

Krillase®
 
Through an asset purchase agreement with ACB Holding AB in 2018, we acquired the Krillase technology, a protease therapeutic platform originally researched and evaluated in the European Union that has the potential for use in the treatment of chronic wounds and burns, and other clinical applications.
 
Krillase, derived from Antarctic krill, shrimp-like crustaceans, is a combination of endo- and exopeptidases that safely and efficiently breaks down organic material. As a “biochemical knife,” Krillase can potentially break down organic matter, such as necrotic tissue, thrombogenic material, and biofilms produced by microorganisms. As such, it may be useful in the mitigation or treatment of multiple disease states in humans. For example, Krillase may promote faster healing, support the grafting of skin for the treatment of chronic wounds and burns, and reduce bacterial biofilms associated with poor oral health in humans and animals.
 
We are currently focused on developing a Krillase-based product for the dissolving of plaque and biofilms on teeth for use in the pet health dental market.
 
Our strategic plan for Krillase is, first, to leverage and maximize near-term revenue generating opportunities with Krillase products for commercial or clinical applications with low regulatory risk, such as in the pet health market, and second, to develop products for applications of the Krillase platform that address unmet medical needs or address medical market needs better than existing products in the marketplace, in clinical applications with higher regulatory risk but significant commercial potential.
 
MAR-FG-001
 
We recently reinitiated the development of MAR-FG-001, our fat grafting technology. The Company intends to develop MAR-FG-001 for use during fat grafting procedures.
 
Fat grafting is a surgical process used in medical reconstructive and other plastic surgery procedures in which fat is transferred from one area of the body to another (known as “autologous fat grafting” or simply “fat grafting”) to correct a defect, replace injured tissue, or to make cosmetic enhancements.
 
Compared to standard solutions, we believe that MAR-FG-001 could better protect adipose tissue from ischemic and oxidative injury and increase adipocyte and stromal cell viability, which is key to improving retention of fat volume thereby improving patient outcomes following fat grafting procedures.
 
The global market for autologous fat grafting was estimated to be $699.96 million in 2021 and was projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.62% until 2028 (“Global Autologous Fat Grafting Market – Industry Trends and Forecast to 2028,” Data Bridge Market Research December 2020). Growing preference for the use of non-invasive aesthetic techniques in skin rejuvenation, more rapid recovery with lesser allergic risks and reduced downtime compared to other procedures are some of the factors contributing to increasing demand. The adoption rate for autologous fat grafting procedures in the United States was 2.2% of all augmentation and reconstruction procedures as of 2018, suggesting significant potential for growth of adoption of these procedures (“Autologous Fat Grafting Market Analysis By Product (Integrated Fat Transfer Systems, Aspiration and Harvesting Systems, Liposuction Systems, Fat Processing Systems, De-epithelialization Devices), By Application & Region - Global Market Insights 2021 to 2031,” Fact.MR, March 2022). With 22.4 million plastic surgeries performed annually in the United States (American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 2020), there is potential for widespread implementation of innovative fat grafting systems.
 
MAR-FG-001 is currently in development and not yet available for sale in any markets.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths will enable us to compete effectively:
 

● | Superior, first-in-class vascular graft treatment. Management believes that the DuraGraft platform provides a significant and substantial competitive advantage over current methods. Having received CE marking in Europe, DuraGraft is certified for marketing in Europe as an EDI. DuraGraft is a product that can minimize vein graft disease and vein graft failure, leading to significantly improved outcomes for patients undergoing CABG surgeries. Our peer-reviewed and published data has demonstrated DuraGraft’s superiority over “standard of care” vein or arterial graft wetting solutions such as saline, buffered solutions, and autologous patient blood in maintaining vascular endothelial cell structure and function. Unlike DuraGraft, these other wetting solutions do not protect against ischemic injury and reduce ischemic reperfusion injury. In addition, they are associated with certain solution tissue incompatibility issues. DuraGraft, with its indication in vascular surgeries, including, for example, in CABG and peripheral vascular surgeries, is the first product CE certified in Europe for marketing. Since receipt of its CE marking certification, we know of no other products that have undergone randomized clinical trials, regulatory review or carry CE marking for this indication.

● | Early detection at point-of-care. Through our MATLOC platform, we plan to provide the ability to quantitatively screen and diagnose for CKD at point-of-care. We believe that the platform’s lab-on-chip technology’s low threshold of detection and sensitivity will enable earlier screening and diagnosis of CKD while the point-of-care capabilities of our MATLOC device(s) will allow for testing outside of a lab setting. CKD usually does not show symptoms until the later stages of the disease, meaning early detection is essential to the prevention of end stage renal disease that often includes treatments such as kidney transplant or dialysis. These treatments are debilitating to patients and expensive to healthcare systems and providers. Also, since most of those patients at risk for CKD are not screening annually, by providing a test at point-of-care, the MATLOC platform can bridge that testing gap. Further, by digitally transferring the quantitative results from the diagnostic device to a patient’s smartphone, we create a system with immediate results able to be shared and tracked for effective management of the disease and empowerment of the patient.

Our Growth Strategies
 
We will strive to grow our business by pursuing the following key growth strategies:
 

● | Commercialize DuraGraft and related products. Continue (i) the distribution of DuraGraft, in Europe and other countries that accept the CE marking and (ii) the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of DuraGraft in the United States. We filed a pre-submission letter for DuraGraft with the FDA in November 2021 and we submitted the De Novo request for DuraGraft to the FDA on January 3, 2023. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercialize MATLOC 1 and related products. Complete the integration of our Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio, or UACR, lab-on-chip technology with our point-of-care MATLOC 1 device for FDA approval and commercialization. MATLOC 1 is expected to be used as a screening device to test those at risk of CKD to slow the progression of the disease. Following our development of MATLOC 1, we intend to develop MATLOC 2, which will incorporate eGFR lab-on-chip technology and allow for a full quantitative CKD diagnosis at point-of-care. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercialize Krillase and related products. Begin to commercialize our Krillase platform through the development of (i) various Krillase-based products and (ii) potential strategic partnerships for these products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop MAR-FG-001 fat grafting technology and products. Continue with the development of MAR-FG-001 to validate its protective abilities and its improvements to the retention of fat volume. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquire more life science assets. Expand our product portfolio through the identification and acquisition of additional life science assets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The strategic plans described above will require capital. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the capital that we need to execute our plans or that capital, whether through securities offerings, either private or public, or other sources, will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to raise sufficient funds could cause us to scale back our development and growth plans or discontinue them altogether.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The Company has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain shortages and other economic conditions, and some of its earlier plans to further diversify its operations and expand its operating subsidiaries were delayed as a result. During 2021 and the first two quarters of 2022, the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s supply chain and its ability to produce DuraGraft inventory was a primary reason that we did not generate substantial revenue from sales of DuraGraft during 2021 and 2022. There can be no assurance that future supply chain and other problems due to COVID-19 outbreaks will not adversely impact our revenues.
 
In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain contract manufacturers and suppliers and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill its orders is critical to the Company’s business success. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact certain of the Company’s manufacturers and suppliers. As a result, the Company has faced and may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products, which could negatively affect the Company’s business and financial results.
 
While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business in the future, the continued spread of COVID-19 and variants of the virus, the rate of vaccinations regionally and globally and the measures taken by the government authorities, and any future epidemic disease outbreaks, could: Disrupt the supply chain and the manufacture or shipment of products and supplies for use by us in our research activities and by strategic partners for their distribution and sales activities; delay, limit or prevent us in our research activities and strategic partners in their distribution and sales activities; impede our negotiations with strategic partners; impede testing, monitoring, data collection and analysis and other related activities by us; interrupt or delay the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may impact review and approval timelines for initiation of clinical trials or marketing; or impede the launch or commercialization of any approved products; any of which could delay our strategic partnership plans, increase our operating costs, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
For a further discussion of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the Company’s supply chain and could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct clinical trials and engage with our third-party vendors and thereby have a material adverse effect on our financial results.”

Competition
 
Competition in the medical device and life science industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in medical device development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique medical devices or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those medical devices as treatments.

There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad were adequate or that competition will not independently develop similar technology.
 
Manufacturing, Distribution and Marketing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing or distribution facilities. We expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our medical technology devices that we commercialize.
 
After receiving FDA marketing approval, we expect to rely on contracted commercial manufacturers and distributors with established track records for quality and compliance. We expect to continue to develop products and devices that can be produced and distributed cost-effectively by contract manufacturing facilities and distribution collaborators.
 
We expect that DuraGraft will be marketed to the international market by capitalizing its CE marking, through the use of distribution partners focusing on cardiac surgeons and cardiologists. We expect DuraGraft’s marketing and sales will focus on uses for the harvesting and grafting interval of vascular surgery as a treatment to maintain structural and functional integrity of vascular conduits. Upon receiving FDA approval, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, we expect MATLOC 1 will be marketed and sold through an experienced medical device distribution partner network with a focus on nephrologists in hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and private practices to better assess patients and slow the progression of the disease. We initially expect to commercialize and distribute Krillase primarily by initiating partnerships with large and small retailers who make up the majority of the pet health treat industry. For all three technology platforms, the Company will employ an active digital and social marketing campaign. In the United States, we intend to enter into a commercialization arrangement with a strategic partner who will be responsible for the marketing and sales of DuraGraft in the U.S. If we are not able to find an appropriate strategic partner, we will have to build our own marketing and sales capabilities at a significant cost to us.

Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government Regulation – Climate change and increased focus by governments, stockholders and customers on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.” for discussion of material related risks. While we believe that our products and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our products or potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Reorganizations, Purchase or Sale of Assets
 
Other than as described above, there have been no other material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not done in the ordinary course of business pertaining to the Company.
Regulation
 
The FDA, European Union competent authorities and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of medical device products such as those the Company has developed and is developing. These agencies and federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labelling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of the Company’s medical device medical devices. To comply with the regulatory requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company is marketing or seeking to market and subsequently sell its products, the Company is establishing processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch (including post market surveillance) of its products and to position those products in order to gain market share.
 
We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
 
U.S. Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and its implementing regulations.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending Market Authorizations, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a medical device may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of design control activities (including design verification activities such as pre-clinical laboratory tests, engineering tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) regulations and 21 CFR part 820 regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which must become approved before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, of the study protocol and informed consent forms for the clinical site before each trial may be initiated. Multiple sites may necessitate the involvement of multiple IRBs and submissions; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed medical device product for each indication; 
● | submission to the FDA of a Marketing Application (510(k), De Novo, Premarket Approval (PMA), etc.) which would include the study reports of the clinical trials, pre-clinical testing, design verification and validation activities, labeling, etc. as well as other required sections to be included in the Marketing Authorization; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) or PAI (Pre-approved Inspection) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the medical device’s identity, quality; and 
● | FDA clearance of the medical device.

Pre-clinical Studies and Clinical Trials for Medical Devices
 
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the medical device product’s chemistry, engineering testing, stability, biocompatibility (including toxicity) and shipping (container closure), as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IDE sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, testing, data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IDE. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IDE is submitted. An IDE automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IDE sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IDE may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical trials involve the use of the investigational device to human subjects pursuant to a clinical protocol, under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives or endpoints of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA under the IDE. In addition, an IRB (central or at each institution participating in the clinical trial) must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the medical device has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
FDA Approval of Medical Devices
 
The results of the pre-clinical studies and engineering testing, together with detailed information relating to the product’s composition, manufacture, quality controls and proposed labeling, among other things, and assuming successful completion of clinical testing (if required) are submitted to the FDA as part of a market approval application, requesting clearance to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a market approval application is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Medical Device User Fee Act (“MDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect are dependent on type of submission, and typically the FDA has a goal that ranges between 100 – 300 days from the date of “filing” of a standard market approval application for the substantive review. This total review typically takes longer from the date of submission because the FDA has approximately 15 days to make a “filing” decision. Additionally, if during the filing decision or the substantive review the FDA determines a sponsor must provide additional information (AI), the sponsor has 180 days to provide requested information and during such time, the FDA review clock is halted.
 
Before clearing a market approval application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not clear an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMPs requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before clearing a market approval application, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs requirements.
 
After evaluating the market approval application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue clearance in a form consistent with the type of application. A complete response letter must contain a statement of specific items that prevent the FDA from approving the application and will also contain conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the market approval application and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes clearance to commercially market the medical device product with specific instructions for use for specific indications.
 
The FDA De Novo Classification request provides a marketing pathway to classify novel medical devices for which no legally marketed predicate device exists and general controls or general and special controls provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use. The De Novo classification is a risk-based classification process and devices that are classified into Class I or Class II through a De Novo classification request may be marketed and used as predicates for future premarket notification submissions. With the granting by the FDA of a De Novo request, the new device is authorized to be marketed in the United States and a new classification regulation for the device type is established.
 
A 510(k) application is another premarket submission process made available by the FDA which may be used by itself or in combination with a De Novo classification request to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective (substantially equivalent) to a legally marketed device that is not otherwise subject to pre-market approval requirements. Submitters under a 510(k) application must compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices (predicates) and make and support their substantial equivalency claims. Until the submitter receives an order declaring a device substantially equivalent, the submitter may not proceed to market the device. Once the device is determined to be substantially equivalent, it can then be marketed in the United States.

Even if the FDA clears a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements for Medical Devices
 
Medical device products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA clearance are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a MA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
In addition, medical device manufacturers and other entities involved in the design, manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMPs compliance.
 
Once approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, but are not limited to:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending sponsor MAs or supplements to approved MAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, products, if deemed adulterated, can lead to serious consequences as set forth above as well as civil and criminal penalties.
 
U.S. Medical Regulatory Matters Relating to Medical Devices
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of medical devices following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments and governmental agencies.

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws Governing Medical Devices
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of medical devices, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the medical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and physician payment and medical device pricing transparency laws.
 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if anyone purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. Companies also have been prosecuted for allegedly violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act as a result of impermissible arrangements between companies and healthcare practitioners or as a result of the provision of remuneration by the companies to the healthcare practitioners. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 
The Company may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which the Company conducts its business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule, published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. In the European Union (“EU”), similar privacy requirements have been implemented under EU Law General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016/679). These requirements include provisions related to the processing of personal data of individuals within the EEA and also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which the Company obtains regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use the Company’s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of the Company’s products. Sales of any products for which the Company receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will, therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover the Company’s medical devices could reduce physician utilization of the Company’s products once approved and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable the Company to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on the Company’s investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require the Company to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of the Company’s products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
 
In the EEA, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular medical device to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider the Company’s products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the Company’s products after regulatory approval or clearance, or if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow the Company to sell its products at a profit.

Healthcare Reform
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that includes establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. Since its enactment, the U.S. federal government has delayed or suspended the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA.
 
The Company expects that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price that the Company receives for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the Company from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize the Company’s drugs and medical devices.
 
Additionally, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, unless additional action is taken by Congress.
 
Further, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.

Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation and executive orders designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at a federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drugs and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could impact the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services.
 
U.S. Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, Australia’s Privacy Act 1988, as amended, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Effective January 1, 2023, we also became subject to the California Privacy Rights Act, which expands upon the consumer data use restrictions, penalties and enforcement provisions under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act, another comprehensive data privacy law. Effective July 1, 2023, we will also become subject to the Colorado Privacy Act and Connecticut’s An Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring, which are also comprehensive consumer privacy laws. Effective December 31, 2023, we will also become subject to the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, regarding business handling of consumers’ personal data. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Foreign Government Regulation
 
In order to market the Company’s products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions (e.g., in Europe, the United Kingdom and Switzerland), a sponsor must obtain separate regulatory approvals. For example, in the EEA, medical device products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. As of May 26, 2021, new Marketing Authorizations in the EU must meet the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The activities associated with MA approval are conducted by authorized Notified Bodies (NB) on behalf of the EU competent authorities. Before granting the MA, the NB makes an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. In order to make this determination, a sponsor must submit an application for approval.
 
To the extent that any of the Company’s medical devices are to be approved and sold in a foreign country other than those countries comprising the EEA or other countries that accept CE marking, the Company may be subject to similar laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
