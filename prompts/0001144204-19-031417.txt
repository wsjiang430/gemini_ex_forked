ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Overview
 
Mill City Ventures III, Ltd., formerly known as Poker Magic, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”), is a Minnesota corporation that was incorporated in January 2006. Until December 13, 2012, we were a development-stage company that focused on promoting and placing a proprietary poker game online and into casinos and entertainment facilities nationwide. On December 13, 2012, we filed a Form N-8A with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), notifying the SEC of our intent to register as an internally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). On February 7, 2013, we filed Form N-54A to become a business development company (“BDC”) under the 1940 Act. Presently, we are regulated as a BDC and intend to be taxed as a regulated investment company.
Business Model and Strategy
 
As a BDC, we primarily focus on investing in or lending to private and small-capitalization public companies and making managerial assistance available to such companies. A BDC generally provides shareholders with the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock, while sharing in the possible benefits of investing in emerging-growth or expansion-stage companies that are privately or publicly owned. As permitted by BDC regulations, we may acquire securities directly from private and small-cap public issuers, their affiliates, or from third parties, and may acquire securities issued by small-cap public issuers in open-market purchases effected through public exchanges and automated quotation systems.
 
Our revenues relate to the earnings we receive from our portfolio investments. Our objective is to obtain superior returns from investments in securities and other investment opportunities available to BDCs under the 1940 Act. We intend to invest capital in portfolio companies for purposes of financing acquisitions, organic growth, recapitalizations, buyouts and working capital. In this regard, buyouts generally include transactions that involve the acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity, either by management or other investors. Organic growth refers to growth through the internal operations of the company, whether through investments in marketing initiatives, capital expenditures or other internal growth initiatives, rather than growth by means of acquisitions.
 
We plan to identify potential investments through multiple sources, including without limitation private equity sponsors, investment bankers, brokers, professional contacts, and owners and operators of businesses. We expect to base our investment decisions on our analyses of actual and potential business operations, asset valuations and viable exit strategies to establish appropriate pricing and maximize our return on investment. Subject to regulations applicable to BDCs, we plan to invest in private companies, small-cap public stocks, notes and other forms of debt, investment contracts, and other investments commonly referred to as securities.
 
Competition
 
As a BDC, we compete with strategic buyers, private equity funds, subordinated debt funds and other buyers and financing sources, including traditional financial services companies such as finance companies, commercial banks, investment banks and other equity and non-equity based investment funds. Some of our competitors will be substantially larger and have considerably greater financial resources than we do. Competitors may have a lower cost of funds and many have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and build their market shares. Competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, as a result of this competition, we may be unable to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and meet our investment goals.
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that we are well positioned to secure appropriate investments in target companies for the following reasons:
 

1
-


• | Management Expertise. We believe that our management’s strong combination of experience and contacts in the investment sector, including the experience and contacts of non-management members of our Board of Directors, should attract suitable prospective portfolio companies. Since 1994, Douglas M. Polinsky, our Chief Executive Officer, has been the Chief Executive Officer of Great North Capital Consultants, Inc., a financial advisory company that he founded. Great North Capital Consultants advises corporate clients on matters regarding corporate and governance structures, public company acquisitions of private companies and other transaction-related matters, and also makes direct investments into public and private companies. Our Chief Financial Officer, Joseph A. Geraci, II, has been managing member of Isles Capital, LLC, an advisory and consulting firm that assists small businesses, both public and private, in business development. Mr. Geraci also managed Mill City Advisors, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company that formerly served as the general partner of Mill City Ventures II, LP, a Minnesota limited partnership investment fund that previously invested directly into both private and public companies. Mr. Geraci previously served as a stockbroker and Vice President of Oak Ridge Financial Services, Inc. from June 2000 to December 2004. While at Oak Ridge Financial Services, Mr. Geraci’s business was focused on structuring and negotiating debt and equity private placements with both private and publicly held companies. We believe that our management team’s extensive experience in researching, analyzing, advising and investing in private and publicly held companies will afford us a relative competitive advantage in structuring investments in potential portfolio companies. See “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for a more detailed description of our management team. Although we believe our management provides valuable investment experience to the Company, none of our management team has previously been involved in the operation of a company subject to the BDC requirements and regulations set forth in the 1940 Act. Please see “ Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our management team has no prior experience managing a BDC ” for more information. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible Investment Options. We will have significant relative flexibility in selecting and structuring our investments. We will not be subject to many of the regulatory limitations that govern traditional lending institutions. Also, we will have fairly broad latitude as to the term and nature of our investments. We intend to calculate rates of return on invested capital based on a combination of up-front commitment fees, current and deferred interest rates and residual values, which may take the form of common stock, warrants or future contract payments. We believe that this flexible approach to structuring investments will facilitate positive, long-term relationships with our portfolio companies and enable us to become a preferred source of capital to them after our initial investments. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Longer Investment Horizons. We will not be subject to periodic capital-return requirements that are typical for most private equity and venture capital funds. These types of funds typically return to investors their initial capital investment after a certain period of time, together with any capital gains on such capital investment. These provisions often force such funds to seek the return of their investments in portfolio companies through mergers, public equity offerings or other liquidity events more quickly than they otherwise might, which can result in a lower overall return to investors and adversely affect the ultimate viability of the affected portfolio companies. Because we may invest in the same portfolio companies as these funds, we are subject to these risks if these funds demand an early return on their investments in the portfolio companies. Overall, however, we believe that our flexibility to take a longer-term view should help us to maximize returns on our invested capital while still meeting the needs of our portfolio companies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Investing Across Industries. We expect to seek to obtain and maintain a portfolio of investments that is appropriately balanced among various companies, industries, and end markets. We believe that maintaining a balanced portfolio will mitigate the potential effects of negative economic events for particular companies, industries and markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Process
 
Prospective Portfolio Company Characteristics
 
We have identified several criteria that we believe will prove important in achieving our investment objectives with respect to target portfolio companies. These criteria will provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. Nevertheless, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest.

• | Experienced Management. We will seek portfolio companies that have an experienced and knowledgeable management team or Board of Directors. We will also seek portfolio companies that have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Existing Significant Financial or Strategic Sponsor. We may invest in target companies in which established private equity or venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors have previously invested and make an ongoing contribution to the management of the business. We believe that having an established financial or strategic sponsor that has a meaningful commitment to the business diversifies the capital sources of the target portfolio company, making it more likely to succeed in the longer term. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive Position. We will seek to invest in portfolio companies that have developed, or appear poised to develop, a strong competitive position within their respective sector or niche. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cash Flow Companies. We will seek to invest in portfolio companies that are profitable or nearly profitable on an operating cash flow basis. We may, however, invest in pre-revenue companies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Future Growth. We will seek out target portfolio companies that demonstrate an ability to increase revenues in addition to operating cash flow over time. The anticipated growth rate of a prospective target company will be an important factor in determining the value that we ascribe to any warrants or other equity securities we may acquire in connection with an investment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exit Strategy. Prior to making an investment, we will analyze the potential for that company to increase the liquidity of its equity securities through a future event that would enable us to realize appreciation, if any, in the value of our equity interest. Liquidity events may include an initial public offering, a private sale of our equity interest to a third party, a merger or an acquisition of the company, or a purchase of our equity interest by the company or one of its other investors. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset Liquidation Value. Although we do not intend to operate as an asset-based lender, the prospective liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing any debt securities we hold will be an important factor in our credit analysis of potential portfolio companies. In assessing creditworthiness and asset liquidation value, we expect to consider both tangible assets (such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment) and intangible assets (such as intellectual property, customer lists, networks and databases). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due Diligence
 
If we believe a target portfolio company generally meets the characteristics described above or if we believe that certain of the most important characteristics for that particular target portfolio company or the industry in which it operates are met, or if we have other reasons to believe in the potential profitability of an investment in a target portfolio company, we may perform initial due diligence on that company. Our due-diligence examination for each target portfolio company will differ based on a number of factors but is generally likely to include our:

• | assessment of the market in which the company operates, including any special risks (regulatory or otherwise) that apply, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | assessment of the competitive landscape in that market, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | familiarity with or evaluation of management, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review and assessment of the company’s financing history, as well as the likely need for additional financings, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | risk analysis relating to the terms of the investment and the transaction size, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | assessment of the investment pricing and structure. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The assessments delineated above provide our general approach for our investment decisions, although not all of such activities will be followed in each instance, or some may be stressed moreso than others depending on facts and circumstances. Upon successful completion of this preliminary evaluation, we will decide whether to move forward towards negotiating a letter of intent and, thereafter, definitive documentation for our investment. Depending on timing, we may not use a letter of intent and will instead proceed directly to definitive documentation.

Types of Investments
 
We expect to engage in various investment strategies in order to achieve our overall investment objectives. The particular type of investment strategy we select will depend, among other things, upon market opportunities, the skills and experience of our management and Board of Directors and our overall portfolio composition. Our strategies generally seek to provide (i) in the case of debt, current cash yields and favorable loan-to-value ratios, or other financial guarantees or credit enhancements with respect to loan collateral, and (ii) in the case of equity, favorable long-term growth and income potential together with viable exit or liquidity strategies.
Debt Investments
 
We intend to tailor the terms of each debt investment we make to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. Our expected primary source of return on debt investments is the monthly cash interest we collect on those investments. The particular types of debt investments we may make include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | First lien loans 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Second lien loans
--+------------------


• | Unsecured loans
--+----------------

Equity Investments
 
Like debt investments, we intend to tailor the terms of each equity investment we make to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. As an equity holder, the rights we will generally seek to protect or obtain include minority rights, event-driven rights to “put” or sell our equity back to the portfolio company or certain affiliates or sponsors, and registration rights such as “demand” or “piggyback” registration rights. We may invest in common stock and preferred stock, and may receive warrants in connection with our investments. When we make a debt investment, we may also be granted equity participation in the form of warrants to purchase common equity in the company in the same class of security that the owners or equity sponsors receive upon funding. In addition to purchasing equity securities from the issuer or its affiliates, we may choose to purchase publicly traded equity securities of the issuer, if any, on the open market (i.e., the particular stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the issuer’s equity primarily trades).
Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies
 

Monitoring
----------

 
We monitor our portfolio companies in order to determine whether they are meeting our financing criteria and their respective business plans. We may decline to make additional investments in portfolio companies that do not continue to meet our financing criteria or that fail to successfully execute their business plans. Of course, we may choose to make additional investments in portfolio companies that do not do so, but that we believe will nevertheless perform well in the future.
 
We expect to monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company and their respective industries to assess the appropriate course of action for each company and to evaluate our overall portfolio quality. In this regard, our management team will monitor the status and performance of each individual company on at least a quarterly and, in some cases, a monthly basis.
 
We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our debt and equity positions. By way of example, we may:
 

• | Consider the amortized value or our debt securities; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assess the business development success, including product development, financings, profitability and the portfolio company’s overall adherence to its business plan; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Contact portfolio company management to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4
-


• | Interview portfolio company management and, if appropriate, other financial or strategic sponsors of that portfolio company; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Review monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of our portfolio companies and reliance on publicly available information. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect that current and annual financial statements of portfolio companies will often be available to us to assist us in our fair value reporting obligations under the 1940 Act.
 
Managerial Assistance
 
As a BDC, we offer, and in some cases may provide, significant managerial assistance to those of our portfolio companies intended to qualify as “eligible portfolio companies” under the 1940 Act. We expect that this assistance, if any, will typically involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in their board and management meetings, consulting with and advising their officers and providing other organizational, financial, strategic and transactional guidance.

BDC Regulation
 
The following discussion is a general summary of some of the material prohibitions and restrictions governing BDCs generally. It does not purport to be a complete description of all the laws and regulations affecting BDCs.
 
The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their directors and officers and principal underwriters and certain other related persons, and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of such company’s shares present at a meeting or represented by proxy if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company.
 
Qualifying Assets
 
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than “qualifying assets” listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

6
-

 

Securities of an “ eligible portfolio company ” purchased from the issuer of such securities, from any person who is, or who was within the 13 months prior to the date of purchase, an affiliate of the issuer, or from any other person (subject to limitation by SEC rules), in any case in transactions not involving any public offering. The 1940 Act defines an “eligible portfolio company” as any issuer which:
 

(a) | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | is not an investment company or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | satisfies one of the following:
----+--------------------------------


(i) | does not have outstanding any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit (or, if a broker or dealer may in fact extend or maintain margin credit to a customer with respect to such securities, then at the time of purchase of the issuer’s securities (A) the BDC owns at least 50% of the greatest number of outstanding and issuable equity securities of such issuer (i.e., 50% determined on a fully diluted basis) and the greatest amount of debt securities of such issuer), (B) the BDC is one of the 20 largest holders of record of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities); 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies acting together that includes a BDC, the BDC does in fact exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the issuer, and, as a result of such control, the BDC has an affiliated person serving as a director of the eligible portfolio company; 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million, subject to adjustment by SEC rules; or 
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | by virtue of SEC Rule 2a-46, (A) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, or (B) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange but an aggregate market value (as computed under such rule) of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million. 
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities of any eligible portfolio company (as defined above) that we control through having a person serving on the board of directors of the issuer; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities purchased from an issuer, or from a person who is, or who was within the 13 months prior to the date of purchase, an affiliate of the issuer, which issuer is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States and is not an investment company (or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act), and which is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization (or where the issuance of securities is consummated pursuant to or in consummation of a bankruptcy or reorganization plan or arrangement); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities of an eligible portfolio company (as defined above) purchased from any person in a transaction not involving a public offering, if there is no ready market for such securities and if immediately prior to such purchase the BDC owns at least 60% of the outstanding equity securities of such issuer, as determined on a fully diluted basis; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the conversion of warrants or rights relating to such securities;

Significant Managerial Assistance
 
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. However, to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the foregoing 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, whether through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does in fact so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance.
Temporary Investments
 
Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that at least 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We plan to invest in money markets or cash equivalent instruments. We may, however, invest in repurchase agreements provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. We will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio
 
We will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock, but only if our “asset coverage,” as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must not make any dividend distribution to our shareholders or repurchase securities unless we meet the applicable asset-coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes.

Other
-----

 
We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and good governance practices. We will not “concentrate” our investments (i.e., invest 25% or more of our assets in any particular issuer, determined at the time of investment). We will be required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from indemnifying any director or officer against any liability to our shareholders arising from willful malfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. We are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation.
 

Management
----------

 
Currently, Mr. Douglas M. Polinsky, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Joseph A. Geraci, II, our Chief Financial Officer and a director of the Company, both serve as our senior management team. Our ability to achieve our investment objective will depend on our senior management team’s ability to identify, evaluate, finance and invest in suitable companies that meet our investment goals. Accomplishing this result in a cost-effective manner will largely be a function of managing the due-diligence and investment process, efficiently monitoring investments we make and, in some cases, accessing financing sources on acceptable terms.
