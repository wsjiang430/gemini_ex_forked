Item 1:    Business
Overview
We are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment, with a mission to inspire the world to play. We develop, market, publish and distribute games, content and services that can be played and watched on a variety of platforms, including game consoles, PCs, mobile phones and tablets.
Our Strategic Pillars
There are three core pillars to our strategy:
•Players First
•Commitment to Digital
•One EA
These strategic pillars are built on our focus of delivering a broad and deep portfolio of games and services that engages players across a wide range of geographies, platforms and business models.
Players First
Players are the foundation of our success, and we are committed to thinking about players first in everything we do. Our goal is to build deep, on-going and meaningful relationships with our players. We aim to build these relationships by creating amazing games and services that deliver long-lasting fun and enduring value, by connecting with our players across platforms and social channels, and by delivering flexibility and innovation in our business models. In fiscal year 2019, we continued to innovate for players by including frontline titles in our Origin Access Premier subscription service, publishing our first free-to-play console game, Apex Legends, and investing in more ways to reach our players, such as cloud gaming and esports.
Our games and services are based on a portfolio of intellectual property that includes established brands such as FIFA, Madden NFL, Star Wars, Battlefield, the Sims and Need for Speed. We also have invested, and will continue to invest, in developing and establishing new brands, and in fiscal year 2019 launched two new intellectual properties – Anthem and Apex Legends. We will continue to develop and publish a broad and deep portfolio of games and services that engage players across geographies, platforms and business models.
Commitment to Digital
Players increasingly purchase our games as digital downloads, as opposed to purchasing physical discs, and engage with the live services that we provide on an ongoing basis. Our live services provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players and include in-game purchases, extra content, subscriptions, and esports. For example, the Ultimate Team mode associated with our sports franchises and live services provided for our Battlefield, Star Wars and Sims franchises, have extended the life of those games by engaging players over longer periods of time. The digital transformation also is creating opportunities in platforms, content models and the way in which players engage with our games and services. For example, we

have leveraged brands and assets from franchises historically associated with traditional gaming, such as FIFA, Madden NFL, Star Wars, The Sims, and SimCity, to create free-to-play games that are monetized through live services provided with the game. We also offer subscription services, such as EA Access, Origin Access and Origin Access Premier, as we look to build deeper relationships with our players and offer increased choice and flexibility for our players to try new games.

The portion of our revenue attributable to our digital business has significantly increased from 59 percent in fiscal year 2017 to 67 percent in fiscal year 2018 and 75 percent during fiscal year 2019. We believe that our digital revenue, which generally has a higher gross margin than our packaged goods revenue, will continue to increase during fiscal year 2020 relative to packaged goods revenue as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally.
One EA
As a global leader in digital interactive entertainment, we have an opportunity to leverage our scale to market and deliver engaging games and services to more players across more platforms. Our “One EA” model provides strategic advantages. For example, we have moved much of our PC and console development to one game engine. This creates operational flexibility as our development teams code on a consistent engine and will allow us to transition our products and services to new platforms quickly and cost-effectively. In addition, we’ve brought together our marketing, publishing and analytics functions as a single go-to-market unit and simplified their processes and decision-making in order to improve effectiveness and build flexibility into our marketing strategies.
We also are strengthening the technology that connects our players to each other and to the games they love. We are adopting consistent, cross-company methodologies to better understand our players’ needs and continue to invest in technological infrastructure that enables us to deliver content that will resonate with players, and provide more choice in the way that players connect with their games, with each other, and with new types of content, including esports broadcasts. This connection also allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like FIFA, Battlefield and Star Wars to our players more efficiently. 
Our Games and Services
We develop, market, publish and deliver games and services that can be played and watched on a variety of platforms, including consoles, PCs, mobile phones and tablets. We market and sell our games and services through digital distribution channels and through retail channels. We believe that flexibility across platforms, distribution channels and business models maximizes the opportunity for players to access and enjoy our games and services and increases engagement with our games and services. New platforms, engagement models and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future, and we intend to evaluate these opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 
Digitally, our console games and services can be purchased through third-party storefronts, such as the digital stores of our console platform partners Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Our direct sales to Sony and Microsoft represented approximately 29 percent and 16 percent of total net revenue, respectively, in fiscal year 2019; approximately 27 percent and 16 percent of total net revenue, respectively, in fiscal year 2018; and approximately 19 percent and 17 percent of total net revenue, respectively, in fiscal year 2017. Our mobile and tablet games and services are available through third-party application storefronts such as the Apple App Store and Google Play. Our PC games and services can be downloaded directly through our Origin platform, as well as through third-party online download stores. We also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and PC games and services on their platforms in certain Asian territories, such as our partnerships with Tencent Holdings Limited and Nexon Co. Ltd. for FIFA Online in China and Korea, respectively. Players also can access a selection of our console and PC games and services through our EA Access, Origin Access and Origin Access Premier subscription services. Our packaged goods games are sold directly to mass market retailers, electronics specialty stores and game software specialty stores or through distribution arrangements.
In our games and services, we use brands that we either wholly own (such as Battlefield, The Sims, Apex Legends, Anthem, Need for Speed and Plants v. Zombies) or license from others (such as FIFA, Madden NFL and Star Wars). We develop and publish games and services across diverse genres, such as sports, first-person shooter, action, role-playing and simulation, and offer our games and services through diverse business models and distribution channels, such as retail download, subscription and free-to-play. We believe that the breadth and depth of our portfolio and our flexibility in business models and distribution channels provide us with strategic advantages. These advantages include the opportunity to engage an increasing number of players across more platforms and geographies and a recurring source of revenue from, among other things, our annualized sports franchises (e.g., FIFA, Madden NFL), our console, PC and mobile catalog titles (i.e., titles that did not launch in the current fiscal year), the associated live services and our subscriptions business.

Our largest and most popular game is FIFA, the annualized version of which is consistently one of the best-selling games in the marketplace. Net revenue from FIFA 19, FIFA 18, and FIFA 17 represented approximately 14 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal year 2019 and approximately 11 percent of our total net revenue in each of fiscal year 2018 and 2017. 
Within and alongside our games, we offer live services, including in-game purchases, downloadable content, and esports, that provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players. Our live services net revenue comprised 45 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2019 and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business. Our most popular live service is the Ultimate Team mode associated with our sports franchises. Ultimate Team allows players to collect current and former professional players in order to build, and compete as, a personalized team. Net revenue from Ultimate Team represented approximately 28 percent, 21 percent and 16 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a substantial portion of which was derived from FIFA Ultimate Team.
We also are investing in a number of long-term initiatives that we believe will allow us to better serve and deepen our engagement with our players. For example, we focus on esports through our Competitive Gaming Division. We believe that the interest and enthusiasm that surrounds esports will drive engagement and monetization in our live services in addition to providing revenue through partnerships with sponsors and broadcasters. In addition, we are pursuing technology underlying cloud gaming and subscriptions, which we see as future growth opportunities.
Significant Relationships
Sony & Microsoft. Under the terms of agreements we have entered into with Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. and its affiliates and with Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates, we are authorized to develop and distribute disc-based and digitally-delivered software products and services compatible with PlayStation and Xbox consoles, respectively. Under these agreements with Sony and Microsoft, we are provided with the non-exclusive right to use, for a fixed term and in a designated territory, technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective platform. With respect to our digitally-delivered products and services, the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a “royalty” percentage on the revenue they derive from their sales of our products and services. Our transactions for packaged goods products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, which are accepted on a case-by case basis by Sony or Microsoft (or their designated replicators), as the case may be. For packaged goods products, we pay the console manufacturers a per-unit royalty for each unit manufactured. Many key commercial terms of our relationships with Sony and Microsoft — such as manufacturing terms, delivery times, platform policies and approval conditions — are determined unilaterally, and are subject to change by the console manufacturers.
The platform license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss, liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services, including any claims for patent, copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer. Each platform license may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer, or if we become insolvent. The console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into platform license agreements with us for any future consoles, products or services.
Apple, Google and Other App Stores. We have agreements to distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distributors such as Apple and Google. Our applications are downloaded for mobile devices from third party application storefronts. The distributor charges consumers for content purchased within the application or charges consumers a one-time fee to download the application. Our distribution agreements establish the amounts that are retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us. These arrangements are typically terminable on short notice. The agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications.
Publishing Partners in Asia. We have entered into agreements whereby we partner with certain companies, including Tencent Holdings Limited and Nexon Co., Ltd. or their respective affiliates, pursuant to which these companies publish our mobile and PC free-to-download games in certain Asian territories, including China and Korea. Our players access games from the publishers’ platforms and are charged for additional content purchased within our game environment. The agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publisher, and the amounts passed through to us.
Competition
The market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products, platforms, business models and distribution channels are introduced. We also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products. We face significant competition from companies such as Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive, 
5

Ubisoft, Bethesda, Epic Games, NetEase, Tencent, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, primarily with respect to developing games and services that operate on consoles, PCs and/or mobile devices.
More broadly, we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television, social networking, online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time. Important competitive factors in our industry include game quality and ease of use, innovation, compatibility of products with certain platforms, brand recognition, publisher reputation, reliability, security, creativity, price, marketing, and quality of customer service.
Intellectual Property
To establish and protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, patents, patent applications, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions. We actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property. We also devote financial and operational resources to implement systems, processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property, employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches. In addition, we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services, including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and re-balancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered.
Governmental Regulation
We are a global company subject to various and complex laws and regulations domestically and internationally, including laws and regulations related to user privacy, data collection and retention, consumer protection, content, advertising, localization, information security, intellectual property, competition and taxation, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing, and the application to, and impact on, us is uncertain. Certain of our business models in particular are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations. For example, the growth and development of electronic commerce, virtual items and virtual currency have prompted calls for new laws and regulations, or the application of existing laws or regulations, to these business models.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced the highest percentage of our net bookings in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand and the launch timing of our games. While we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2020, there is no assurance that it will. In addition, we defer the recognition of a portion of our net revenue over an extended period of time. As a result, the quarter in which we generate the highest net bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognized the highest amount of net revenue. 
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately 9,700 regular, full-time employees, over 6,000 of whom were outside the United States. We believe that our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and services and that our future success will depend, in large measure, on our ability to continue attracting, training, motivating and retaining qualified employees. Approximately 8 percent of our employees, all of whom work for our DICE development studio in Sweden, are represented by a union.
