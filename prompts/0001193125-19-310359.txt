Item 1.    Business 
Structure 
 The Trust 
 The World Gold Trust (the “Trust”) was formed as a Delaware statutory trust on August 27, 2014. The Trust consists of multiple series (each, a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”). Each Fund issues common units of beneficial interest that represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of such Fund. The term of the Trust and each Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances). The Trust was organized in separate series as a Delaware statutory trust rather than as separate statutory trusts to achieve certain administrative and other efficiencies. The Trust is sponsored by WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC (“WGC AM” or the “Sponsor”). 
The Funds 
  The Trust has established six separate Funds of which one is operational at September 30, 2019. The accompanying financial statements relate to the Trust, SPDR® Gold MiniSharesSM Trust (“GLDM”) and SPDR® Long Dollar Gold Trust (“GLDW”).

GLDM commenced operations on June 26, 2018. GLDM’s investment objective is for its shares (the “Shares”) to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less GLDM’s expenses. GLDM issues and redeems Shares from time to time in Creation Units to institutional investors referred to as “Authorized Participants.” Creation Units are offered continuously at NAV for 100,000 Shares on the day that an order to create a Creation Unit is accepted by GLDM. Shares trade under the ticker symbol GLDM on the NYSE Arca. Authorized Participants and other investors may buy and sell Shares in the secondary market. Authorized share capital is unlimited, and the par value of Shares is $0.00. 
 GLDW commenced operations on January 27, 2017. On July 15, 2019, the Sponsor notified the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”) that it had determined to voluntarily close GLDW, delist GLDW, liquidate GLDW’s shares and withdraw GLDW’s shares from registration under the Exchange Act. GLDW ceased accepting creation and redemption orders after September 6, 2019 and trading of GLDW’s shares on the NYSE Arca ceased at the open of market on September 10, 2019. The NYSE Arca filed a Form 25 with the Commission on September 11, 2019 and on September 16, 2019, a Post-Effective Amendment deregistering GLDW’s unsold shares was declared effective and the final liquidation payments were made. 
 The principal offices of the Trust and the Funds are at c/o WGC USA Asset Management Company, LLC, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017. 
 The Sponsor 
 The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed on August 1, 2014. WGC AM is wholly-owned by WGC (US) Holdings, Inc. (“WGCUS”), a Delaware corporation. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor, WGCUS is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor.
 The Sponsor is responsible for establishing the Funds and for the registration of the shares of each Fund. The Sponsor generally oversees the performance of the Funds’ principal service providers but does not exercise day-to-day oversight over such service providers. The Sponsor maintains a public website on behalf of the Funds, containing information about each of the Funds and their respective shares. The Internet address of the Sponsor’s website is http://www.spdrgoldshares.com. This Internet address is only provided here as a convenience to you, and the information contained on or connected to the Sponsor’s website is not considered part of this filing.

   The Trust’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K,  and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are made available free of charge on the Sponsor’s website after they have been filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC’s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.
 The Trustee 
 Delaware Trust Company, a Delaware trust company with trust powers, serves as the sole trustee of the Trust (the “Trustee”). The Trustee’s duties and liabilities with respect to the offering of shares and the management of the Trust and GLDM are limited to its express obligations under the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (“Declaration of Trust”), dated as of April 16, 2018, between the Sponsor and the Trustee. 
The Administrator 
 The Administrator of GLDM is BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon (“BNYM” or the “Administrator”). The Administrator is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration and operation of the Funds, including the calculation of the Funds’ NAV and NAV per share.
 The Transfer Agent 
 BNYM serves also as GLDM’s Transfer Agent in connection with Creation and Redemption transactions of the Shares and acts as the Funds’ distribution disbursing agent. The Transfer Agent receives and processes orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Shares and coordinates the processing of such orders with the Custodian and The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). 
The Custodian 
 The Custodian on behalf of GLDM is ICBC Standard Bank Plc (“ICBC” or the “Custodian”). The Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the gold bullion held by GLDM, which includes the gold bullion bars delivered to GLDM by Authorized Participants in connection with the creation of Creation Units. The Custodian also facilitates the transfer of gold bullion into and out of GLDM through gold bullion accounts maintained for Authorized Participants. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”). The Custodian maintains insurance in support of its custodial obligations under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement to help protect against the risk of loss for gold deposits. There can be no guarantee such insurance will be sufficient to cover all potential loss of gold deposits. 
The Marketing Agent 
 The Marketing Agent is State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (the “Marketing Agent”). The Sponsor has entered into the Marketing Agent Agreement with the Marketing Agent to assist the Sponsor in marketing the Funds’ shares. The Marketing Agent is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA. 
 GLDM is a Passive Investment Vehicle 
 GLDM is a passive investment vehicle designed for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less GLDM’s expenses. GLDM’s gold bullion holdings are not managed and GLDM does not have any investment discretion. 
 The Trust Is an Emerging Growth Company 
 The Trust is an “emerging growth company” subject to reduced public company reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities laws. The Trust has not elected to make use of the extended transition

  period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). This election is irrevocable. However, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies like the Trust are subject to reduced public company reporting requirements, as more fully described in “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—The Trust is an emerging growth company subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.” 
 The Trust expects to remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year on which the fifth anniversary of its initial public offering of shares occurs and (ii) the Trust becomes a “large accelerated filer” within the meaning of the Exchange Act. Other conditions that may trigger a loss of “emerging growth company” status, such as certain issuances of non-convertible debt and having annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, are not expected to apply to the Trust due to the limited nature of its operations.
 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE 
 The investment objective of GLDM is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less GLDM’s expenses. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca and provide institutional and retail investors with indirect access to the gold bullion market. The Shares may be bought and sold on the NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed securities. The Sponsor expects that, for many investors, costs associated with buying and selling the Shares in the secondary market and the payment of GLDM’s ongoing expenses will be lower than the costs associated with buying and selling gold bullion and storing and insuring gold bullion in a traditional allocated gold bullion account. 
 GLDM’s NAV is the aggregate value of GLDM’s assets less its liabilities (which include estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses). The NAV is calculated based on the price of gold per ounce times the number of ounces of gold owned by GLDM. For purposes of calculating NAV, the number of ounces of gold owned by GLDM reflects the amount of gold delivered into (or out of) GLDM on a daily basis by Authorized Participants creating and redeeming Shares. Except as otherwise described herein, in determining the NAV, the Administrator will value the gold bullion held by GLDM on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA 3:00 PM auction process (“LBMA Gold Price PM”). If no LBMA Gold Price PM is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 p.m. New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) will be used to determine the NAV, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. If the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use, it shall identify an alternate basis for evaluation of the gold bullion held by GLDM. 
 Sales of Gold 
 The Administrator sells GLDM’s gold as necessary to pay its expenses. As a result, the amount of gold sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of expenses and the market price of gold. Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, the Administrator sells gold to the Custodian at the next LBMA Gold Price PM, following the sale order. Neither the Administrator nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. Any cash held by the Administrator on behalf of the Funds does not bear any interest. 
 The Administrator may also sell GLDM’s gold if the Sponsor notifies the Administrator that the sale of gold is required by applicable law or regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of GLDM. The Administrator will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of gold directed by the Sponsor. Any property received by GLDM other than gold, cash or an amount receivable in cash (such as, for example, an insurance claim) will be promptly sold or otherwise disposed of by the Administrator.

  Gold Price Information 
 Investors may obtain gold pricing information on a 24-hour basis based on the spot price for an ounce of gold from various financial information service providers. Current spot prices are also generally available with bid/ask spreads from gold bullion dealers. In addition, the Sponsor’s website provides ongoing pricing information for gold spot prices and the Shares. Market prices for the Shares are available from a variety of sources including brokerage firms, information websites and other information service providers. The NAV of GLDM is published by the Sponsor on each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading and is posted on the Sponsor’s website at www.spdrgoldshares.com.
THE GOLD INDUSTRY 
 Gold Supply and Demand 
 Gold is a physical asset that is accumulated rather than consumed. As a result, virtually all the gold that has ever been mined still exists today in one form or another. Gold Focus 2019 estimates that existing above-ground stocks of gold totaled approximately 191,000 tonnes (approximately 6 billion ounces) at the end of 2018.1
 World Gold Supply and Demand (2014—2018)

  Sources of Gold Supply 
 Based on data from Gold Focus 2019, gold supply averaged 4,580 tonnes (“t”) per year between 2014 and 2018. Sources of gold supply include both mine production and recycled above-ground stocks and, to a lesser extent, producer net hedging. The largest portion of gold supplied to the market is from mine production, which averaged approximately 3,367t per year from 2014 through 2018. The second largest source of annual gold supply is recycling gold, which is gold that has been recovered from jewelry and other fabricated products and converted back into marketable gold. Recycled gold averaged approximately 1,183t annually between 2014 through 2018.
Sources of Gold Demand 
 Based on data from Gold Focus 2019, gold demand averaged 4,235t per year between 2014 and 2018. Gold demand generally comes from four sources: jewelry, industry (including medical applications), investment and the official sector (including central banks and supranational organizations). The largest source of demand comes from jewelry fabrication, which accounted for approximately 55% of the identifiable demand from 2014 through 2018 followed by net physical investment, which represents identifiable investment demand, which accounted for approximately 25%.
 Gold demand is widely dispersed throughout the world with significant contributions from India and China. In many countries there are seasonal fluctuations in the levels of demand for gold—especially jewelry. However, as a result of variations in the timing of seasons throughout the world, seasonal fluctuations in demand do not appear to have a significant impact on the global gold price. 
 Between 2014 and 2018, according to Gold Focus 2019, central bank purchases averaged 517t. The prominence given by market commentators to this activity coupled with the total amount of gold held by the official sector has resulted in this area being one of the more visible shifts in the gold market.
 Operation of the Gold Bullion Market 
 The global trade in gold consists of over-the-counter, or OTC, transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options.
 Global Over-the-Counter Market 
 The OTC market trades on a continuous basis and accounts for most global gold trading. Market makers and participants in the OTC market trade with each other and their clients on a principal-to-principal  basis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. The three products relevant to LBMA market making are Spot (S), Forwards (F) and Options (O). There are twelve LBMA Market Makers who provide the service in one, two or all three products.4

  The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in term of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet their clients’ requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place. 
 The main centers of the OTC market are London, New York and Zurich. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business. Bullion dealers have offices around the world and most of the world’s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA. 
 In the OTC market, the standard size of gold trades ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer  spreads are typically $0.50 per ounce. Transaction costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely, with some dealers willing to offer clients competitive prices for larger volumes, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions. Cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers as well as dealers.
 Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads—the difference between a dealer’s “buy” and “sell” prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the gold market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange Inc. (the “COMEX”).
 The London Bullion Market 
 Although the market for physical gold is global, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the “London Good Delivery Lists,” which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of gold. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation. 
 The term “loco London” refers to gold bars physically held in London that meet the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of an LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in “The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars” published by the LBMA. Gold bars meeting these requirements are known as “London Good Delivery Bars.” The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams = 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. A London Good Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. Typically referred to as 400-  ounce bars, a London Good Delivery Bar must contain between 350 and 430 fine troy ounces of gold, with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%), be of good appearance and be easy to handle and stack. The fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar (expressed in units of 0.025 troy ounces) by the fineness of the bar.
LBMA Gold Price 
 The LBMA Gold Price is determined twice daily during London trading hours through an auction which provides reference gold prices for that day’s trading. The LBMA Gold Price was initiated on March 20, 2015 and replaced the London PM Gold Fix. The auction that determines the LBMA Gold Price is a physically settled, electronic and tradeable auction, with the ability to settle trades in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds. The IBA provides the auction platform and methodology as well as the overall administration and governance for the LBMA Gold Price. Many long-term contracts are expected to be priced on the basis of either the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) LBMA Gold Price, and many market participants are expected to refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. 
 The Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) in the U.K. regulates the LBMA Gold Price.

 Futures Exchanges 
 The most significant gold futures exchange is the COMEX, part of the CME Group. It began to offer trading in gold futures contracts in 1974, and for most of the period since that date, it has been the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options. The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (the “TOCOM”) is another significant futures exchange and has been trading gold since 1982. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. Both the COMEX and the TOCOM operate through a central clearance system, and in each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. 
 Over recent years China has become an important source of gold demand, and its futures markets have grown. Gold futures contracts are traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange. 
 Market Regulation 
 The global gold markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants. 
BUSINESS 
 GLDM holds only gold bullion. As such, the gold bullion held by GLDM will only be sold (1) on an as-needed basis to pay GLDM’s expenses, (2) in the event GLDM terminates and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. The sale of gold bullion by GLDM is a taxable event to shareholders.
CREATION AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES 
 GLDM creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Units (a Creation Unit equals a block of 100,000 Shares). The creation and redemption of Creation Units is only made in exchange for the delivery to GLDM or the distribution by GLDM of the amount of gold bullion represented by the Creation Units being created or redeemed. The amount of gold bullion required to be delivered to GLDM in connection with any creation, or paid out upon redemption, is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Creation Units being created or redeemed as determined on the day the order to create or redeem Creation Units is properly received and accepted. The standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer securities transactions is two business days, T+2 (the trade date plus two business days). 
 Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem Creation Units. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into a Participant Agreement with the Administrator. The Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Administrator and the Sponsor without the consent of any shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants who make deposits with GLDM in exchange for Creation Units receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or GLDM, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or GLDM to effect any sale or resale of Shares. 
 Authorized Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem Creation Units. An order for one or more Creation Units may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Persons interested in purchasing Creation Units should contact the Sponsor or the Administrator to obtain the contact information for the Authorized Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants’ will only be able to redeem their Shares through an Authorized Participant. 
 
 7



 All gold bullion must be delivered by Authorized Participants to GLDM and distributed by GLDM in unallocated form through credits and debits between Authorized Participants’ Unallocated Accounts and the GLDM Unallocated Account. 
 All gold bullion must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%) and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, including the specifications for a London Good Delivery Bar. 
 Delivery of Required Deposits 
 An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring the required gold bullion deposit amount to the GLDM Unallocated Account on the second business day in London following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the gold bullion deposit amount, the Administrator will direct DTC to credit the number of Creation Units ordered to the Authorized Participant’s DTC account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of gold bullion until such gold bullion has been received by GLDM will be borne solely by the Authorized Participant. If gold bullion is to be delivered other than as described above, the Sponsor is authorized to establish such procedures and to appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts as the Sponsor determines to be desirable. 
 Acting on standing instructions given by the Administrator, the Custodian will transfer the gold bullion deposit amount from the GLDM Unallocated Account to the GLDM Allocated Account by allocating to the GLDM Allocated Account specific bars of gold bullion which the Custodian holds or instructing a subcustodian to allocate specific bars of gold bullion held by or for the subcustodian. The gold bullion bars in an allocated gold bullion account are specific to that account and are identified by a list which shows, for each gold bullion bar, the refiner, assay or fineness, serial number and gross and fine weight. Gold bullion held in GLDM’s allocated account is the property of GLDM and is not traded, leased or loaned under any circumstances. 
 The Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the transfer of gold bullion to the GLDM Allocated Account prior to the time by which the Administrator is to credit the Creation Unit to the Authorized Participant’s DTC account; if, however, such transfers have not been completed by such time, the number of Creation Units ordered will be delivered against receipt of the gold bullion deposit amount in the GLDM Unallocated Account, and all shareholders will be exposed to the risks of unallocated gold bullion to the extent of that gold bullion deposit amount until the Custodian completes the allocation process. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Custody of Gold—Gold bullion held in GLDM’s unallocated gold bullion account and any Authorized Participant’s unallocated gold bullion account is not segregated from the Custodian’s assets.” 
 Rejection of Purchase Orders 
 GLDM has the right, but not the obligation, to reject a purchase order if (i) the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement, (ii) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful, (iii) it determines that acceptance of the order from an Authorized Participant would expose GLDM to credit risk, or (iv) circumstances outside the control of the Administrator, the Sponsor or the Custodian make the purchase, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process. 
Redemption Procedures 
 The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Creation Units mirror the procedures for the creation of Creation Units. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Administrator to redeem one or more Creation Units. Redemption orders must be placed with the Administrator no later than 3:59:59 p.m. New York time. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Administrator. The day on which the Administrator receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. 
 
 8



 Trading of Shares 
 The Shares are listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol GLDM. The Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary market throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities. While the Shares are issued in Creation Units at NAV, the Shares traded in the secondary market may trade at prices that are lower or higher than their NAV per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share is a function of supply and demand, among other things, and may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca and the COMEX, London, Zurich and Singapore. While the Shares trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the global gold market is reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, after 1:30 p.m. New York time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen.
 Most retail investors purchase and sell the Shares through traditional brokerage or other intermediary accounts. Purchases or sales of the Shares in the secondary market, which will not involve the Funds, may be subject to customary brokerage commissions. 
 Determination of Redemption Distribution 
 The redemption distribution from GLDM consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant’s Unallocated Account in the amount of the Creation Unit Gold Delivery Amount. The Creation Unit Gold Delivery Amount for redemptions is the number of ounces of gold bullion held by GLDM to be paid out upon redemption of a Creation Unit. There will be no cash distributions made to Authorized Participants upon redemption. 
Delivery of Redemption Distribution 
 The redemption distribution due from GLDM is delivered to the Authorized Participant on the second business day following the redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on such second business day, the Administrator’s DTC account has been credited with the Creation Units to be redeemed. The Custodian transfers the redemption gold bullion amount from the GLDM Allocated Account to the GLDM Unallocated Account and, thereafter, to the redeeming Authorized Participant’s unallocated account. The Authorized Participant and GLDM are each at risk in respect of gold bullion credited to their respective unallocated accounts in the event of the Custodian’s insolvency. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Custody of Gold—Gold bullion held in GLDM’s unallocated gold bullion account and any Authorized Participant’s unallocated gold bullion account is not segregated from the Custodian’s assets.” 
Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders 
 GLDM may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date for: (1) any period during which NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, (2) any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold bullion is not reasonably practicable, or (3) such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders. 
 GLDM has the right, but not the obligation, to reject a redemption order if (i) the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement, (ii) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful, (iii) it determines that acceptance of the order from an Authorized Participant would expose GLDM to credit risk, or (iv) circumstances outside the control of the Administrator, the Sponsor or the Custodian make the redemption, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process. 
 The Sponsor will not be liable to any person or liable in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension, postponement or rejection.

 Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 
 An Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee of $500 per order to create or redeem Creation Units of GLDM. An order may include multiple Creation Units. The transaction fee may be changed from time to time at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and upon written notice to the Authorized Participant, which notice may be provided by disclosure in GLDM’s prospectus. In addition, the Sponsor may waive the transaction fee on the creation or redemption of Creation Units for one or more Authorized Participants from time to time in its sole discretion. 
LIABILITY 
 No shareholder of GLDM shall be subject in such capacity to any personal liability whatsoever to any person in connection with GLDM’s property or the acts, obligations or affairs of GLDM. Shareholders shall have the same limitation of personal liability as is extended to stockholders of a private corporation for profit incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
CUSTODY OF GLDM’S GOLD 
 The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time purchase or sell gold bullion or Shares for their own accounts, as agents for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Unless otherwise agreed by GLDM, the Custodian will hold the gold bullion deposited with and held for the account of GLDM at its London, England vault, except when the gold bullion has been allocated in the vault of a subcustodian solely for temporary custody and safekeeping. If held by a subcustodian, the Custodian has agreed that it will use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to transport the gold bullion from the subcustodian’s vault to the Custodian’s vault, at the Custodian’s cost and risk. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher of gold under the rules of the LBMA. 
 The Custodian, as instructed by the Sponsor or GLDM, is authorized to accept, on behalf of GLDM, deposits of gold bullion in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions given by the Sponsor or GLDM, the Custodian allocates gold bullion deposited in unallocated form with GLDM by selecting bars of gold bullion for deposit to the GLDM Allocated Account from unallocated bars that the Custodian holds or by instructing a subcustodian to allocate bars from unallocated bars held by the subcustodian. All gold bullion allocated to GLDM must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, and the Custodian must replace any nonconforming gold bullion with conforming gold bullion as soon as practical. 
 The gold bullion bars in an allocated gold bullion account are specific to that account and are identified by a list which shows, for each gold bullion bar, the refiner, assay or fineness, serial number and gross and fine weight. Gold bullion held in GLDM’s allocated account is the property of GLDM and is not traded, leased or loaned under any circumstances. 
 The gold bullion bars held in an unallocated account are not segregated from the Custodian’s assets. The account holder therefore has no ownership interest in any specific bars of gold bullion that the unallocated account’s bullion dealer holds or owns. The account holder is an unsecured creditor of the bullion dealer, and credits to an unallocated account are at risk of the bullion dealer’s insolvency, in which event it may not be possible for a liquidator to identify any gold bullion held in an unallocated account as belonging to the account holder rather than to the bullion dealer. 
 The Trust, on behalf of GLDM, and the Custodian have entered into Custody Agreements that establish the GLDM Unallocated Account and the GLDM Allocated Account. The GLDM Unallocated Account is used for several purposes including to facilitate the transfer of gold bullion deposits and gold bullion redemption distributions between Authorized Participants and GLDM in connection with the creation and redemption of Creation Units. It is also used for sales of gold bullion to pay GLDM’s expenses, and when gold bullion is transferred into and out of GLDM. The Custodian is instructed to allocate all gold bullion deposited with GLDM to the GLDM Allocated Account by the close of business on each

 Business Day. The Custodian is authorized to appoint from time to time one or more subcustodians to hold GLDM’s gold bullion until it can be transported to the Custodian’s vault. The Custodian has not utilized any subcustodians to date. In accordance with LBMA practices and customs, the Custodian does not have written custody agreements with the subcustodians it selects. This could affect the recourse of GLDM and the Custodian against any subcustodian in the event a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of GLDM’s gold bullion. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Custody of Gold—The ability of the Administrator and the Custodian to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited.” The Custodian is required to use reasonable care in selecting subcustodians and will monitor the conduct of each subcustodian, and, where it is legally permissible to do so, promptly advise the Trust of any difficulties or problems existing with respect to such subcustodian of which the Custodian is aware. The Custodian is obliged under the Allocated Gold Account Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of gold bullion from those subcustodians appointed by it. Under the Allocated Gold Account Agreement, except for an obligation on the part of the Custodian to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of GLDM’s gold bullion bars from any subcustodians appointed by the Custodian, the Custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions, or for the solvency, of its subcustodians unless the selection of such subcustodians was made by the Custodian fraudulently, negligently or in bad faith. Under the customs and practices of the London bullion market, allocated gold bullion is held by custodians and, on their behalf, by subcustodians under arrangements that permit each entity for which gold bullion is being held: (1) to request from the entity’s custodian (and a custodian or subcustodian to request from its subcustodian) a list identifying each gold bullion bar being held and the identity of the particular custodian or subcustodian holding the gold bullion bar and (2) to request the entity’s custodian to release the entity’s gold within two business days following demand for release. Each custodian or subcustodian is obligated under the customs and practices of the London bullion market to provide the bar list and the identification of custodians and subcustodians referred to in (1) above, and each custodian is obligated to release gold as requested. Under English law, unless otherwise provided in any applicable custody agreement, a custodian generally is liable to its customer for failing to take reasonable care of the customer’s gold and for failing to release the customer’s gold upon demand. 
 The Custodian does not require any subcustodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities. The Custodian has agreed to maintain insurance in connection with the storage of GLDM’s precious metal under the Custody Agreements, including covering any loss of gold, on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate, which may not cover the full amount of gold. The Sponsor (so long as the Sponsor is WGC AM) and GLDM may, subject to confidentiality restrictions, review this insurance coverage, and the Custodian will provide the Trust with evidence of the Custodian’s insurance at GLDM’s request within 10 business days following the end of the calendar year. GLDM will not be a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the nature or amount of the coverage. Therefore, shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian maintains adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold bullion held by the Custodian on behalf of GLDM. 
 Description of the GLDM Custody Agreements 
 The Allocated Gold Account Agreement and the Unallocated Gold Account Agreement between the Trust, on behalf of GLDM, and the Custodian establishes the GLDM Allocated Account and the GLDM Unallocated Account, respectively. These agreements are sometimes referred to together as the “Custody Agreements.” The following is a description of the material terms of the Custody Agreements. As the Custody Agreements are similar in form, they are discussed together, with material distinctions between the agreements noted. 
 Transfers into the GLDM Unallocated Account 
 The Custodian credits to the GLDM Unallocated Account the amount of gold bullion it receives from the GLDM Allocated Account, an Authorized Participant’s unallocated gold account, or from other third-party unallocated accounts representing the right to receive gold bullion. Unless otherwise agreed

 by the Custodian in writing, the only gold bullion the Custodian will accept in physical form for credit to the GLDM Unallocated Account is gold bullion transferred from the GLDM Allocated Account. No interest will be paid by the Custodian on any credit balance to the GLDM Unallocated Account. 
 Transfers from the GLDM Unallocated Account 
 The Custodian transfers gold bullion from the GLDM Unallocated Account only in accordance with the instructions to the Custodian. A transfer of gold bullion from the GLDM Unallocated Account may only be made, (1) by transferring gold bullion to an Authorized Participant’s unallocated account, (2) by transferring gold bullion to the GLDM Allocated Account, (3) by making gold bullion available for collection at the Custodian’s vault premises or at such other location as the Custodian may specify, (4) by delivering the gold bullion to such location as the Trust directs at GLDM’s expense and risk, or (5) by transferring to an account maintained by the Custodian or by a third party on an unallocated basis in connection with the sale of Gold or other permitted transfers. Any gold bullion made available in physical form will be in a form which complies with the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, the Bank of England or any applicable regulatory body, or Custody Rules, or in such other form as may be agreed between the Administrator and the Custodian, and in all cases will comprise one or more whole gold bullion bars selected by the Custodian. 
 The Custody Agreements provide for the full allocation of all gold bullion received from the Authorized Participants or other third parties and credited to the GLDM Unallocated Account at the end of each business day. The Sponsor established an overdraft facility with the Custodian under which the Custodian makes available to the GLDM Unallocated Account up to 430 fine ounces of gold bullion in order to allow the Custodian to fully allocate all gold bullion credited to the GLDM Unallocated Account to the GLDM Allocated Account at the end of each business day. 
 Transfers into the GLDM Allocated Account 
 With respect to gold bullion delivered by Authorized Participants, the Custodian receives transfers of gold bullion into the GLDM Allocated Account only at the Trust’s instructions by debiting gold bullion from the GLDM Unallocated Account and crediting such gold bullion to the GLDM Allocated Account. 
 Transfers from the GLDM Allocated Account 
 The Custodian transfers gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account only in accordance with the Trust’s instructions. Generally, the Custodian transfers gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account only by debiting gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account and crediting the gold bullion to the GLDM Unallocated Account. 
 Withdrawals of Gold Directly from the GLDM Allocated Account 
 Upon the Trust’s instruction, the Custodian debits gold bullion from the GLDM Allocated Account and makes the gold bullion available for collection by the Trust or, if separately agreed, for delivery by the Custodian in accordance with its usual practices at GLDM’s expense and risk. The Trust and the Custodian expect that the Trust will withdraw gold bullion physically from the GLDM Allocated Account (rather than by crediting it to the GLDM Unallocated Account and instructing a further transfer from that account) only in exceptional circumstances, such as if, for some unforeseen reason, it was not possible to transfer gold bullion in unallocated form. The Custodian is not obliged to effect any requested delivery if, in its reasonable opinion, (1) this would cause the Custodian or its agents to be in breach of the Custody Rules or other applicable law, court order or regulation, (2) the costs incurred would be excessive or (3) delivery is impracticable for any reason. When gold bullion is physically withdrawn from the GLDM Allocated Account pursuant to the Trust’s instruction, all right, title, risk and interest in and to the gold bullion withdrawn shall pass to the person to whom or for whose account such gold bullion is transferred, delivered or collected at the time the recipient or its agent acknowledges in writing its receipt of gold bullion. Unless the Trust specifies the bars of gold bullion to be debited from the GLDM Allocated Account, the Custodian is entitled to select the gold bullion bars.

 Exclusion of Liability 
 The Custodian will use reasonable care in the performance of its duties under the Custody Agreements and is only responsible for any loss or damage suffered by GLDM as a direct result of any negligence, fraud, or willful default on the part of the Custodian in the performance of the duties under the Custody Agreements. The Custodian’s liability is further limited to the market value of the gold bullion held in the GLDM Allocated Account and the amount of the gold bullion credited to the GLDM Unallocated Account at the time such negligence, fraud, or willful default is either discovered by or notified to the Custodian, provided that the Custodian notifies the Sponsor and the Trust promptly after any discovery. Furthermore, the Custodian has no duty to make or take or to require any subcustodian selected by it to make or take any special arrangements or precautions beyond those required by the Custody Rules or as specifically set forth in the Custody Agreements. 
 In the event of a loss caused by the failure of the Custodian or a subcustodian to exercise reasonable care, the Trust, on behalf of GLDM, has the right to seek recovery from the Custodian in breach. The Custodian is not liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance of any of its obligations under the Custody Agreements by reason of any cause beyond the Custodian’s reasonable control, including any act of God or war or terrorism, any breakdown, malfunction or failure of, or in connection with, any communication, computer, transmission, clearing or settlement facilities, industrial action, acts, rules and regulations of any governmental or supra national bodies or authorities or relevant regulatory or self-regulatory organizations.
Indemnity 
 Solely out of GLDM’s assets, GLDM will indemnify the Custodian against all costs and expenses, damages, liabilities and losses (other than Value Added Tax and the expenses assumed by the Sponsor under its Agreement with the Custodian) which the Custodian may suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, in connection with services provided to GLDM under the Custody Agreements, except to the extent that such sums are due directly to the Custodian’s negligence, willful default or fraud. 
Termination 
 GLDM and the Custodian may each terminate any Custody Agreement upon 90 business days’ prior written notice. GLDM and the Custodian each may terminate any Custody Agreement immediately by written notice in the event it becomes unlawful for the Custodian or the Trust to be a party to the Agreement or for the Custodian to offer its services to the Trust or for the Trust to receive such services. GLDM and the Custodian each may terminate any Custody Agreement immediately by written notice in the event either party determines in its commercially reasonable opinion the existence of the presentation of a winding-up order, bankruptcy or analogous event in relation to the other party. If either the Allocated Gold Account Agreement or the Unallocated Gold Account Agreement is terminated, the other agreement automatically terminates.
Governing Law 
 The GLDM Custody Agreements are governed by English law. The Administrator and the Custodian both consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Such consent is not required for any person to assert a claim of New York jurisdiction over the Trustee or the Custodian.
