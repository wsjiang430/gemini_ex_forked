ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Astronics Corporation (“Astronics” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of advanced technologies to the global aerospace, defense and electronics industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation, distribution and motion systems, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, systems and certification, aircraft structures and automated test systems.
We have operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and France. We design and build our products through our wholly owned subsidiaries Astronics Advanced Electronic Systems Corp. (“AES”); Astronics AeroSat Corporation (“AeroSat”); Armstrong Aerospace, Inc. (“Armstrong”); Astronics Test Systems, Inc. (“ATS”); Ballard Technology, Inc. (“Ballard”); Astronics Connectivity Systems and Certification Corp. (“CSC”); Astronics Custom Control Concepts Inc. (“CCC”); Astronics DME LLC (“DME”); Luminescent Systems, Inc. (“LSI”); Luminescent Systems Canada, Inc. (“LSI Canada”); Max-Viz, Inc. (“Max-Viz”); Peco, Inc. (“Peco”); and PGA Electronic s.a. (“PGA”).
Acquisitions
On April 3, 2017, Astronics Custom Control Concepts Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Custom Control Concepts LLC, located in Kent, Washington. CCC is a provider of cabin management and in-flight entertainment systems for a range of aircraft. The total consideration for the transaction was $10.2 million, net of $0.5 million in cash acquired. CCC is included in our Aerospace segment.
On December 1, 2017, Astronics acquired substantially all of the assets of Telefonix Inc. and a related company, Product Development Technologies, LLC and its subsidiaries, to become CSC, primarily located in Waukegan and Lake Zurich, Illinois. CSC designs and manufactures advanced in-flight entertainment and connectivity equipment, and provides industry leading design consultancy services for the global aerospace industry. The Company's products include wireless access points, file servers, content loaders and passenger control units. The total consideration for the transaction was $103.8 million, net of $0.2 million in cash acquired. CSC is included in our Aerospace segment.
Divestiture
On February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems segment. The total cash proceeds of the divestiture amounted to approximately $103.5 million, consisting of $100 million cash at closing, plus approximately $3.5 million related to the sale of certain related inventory. The Company expects to record a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $80 million in the first quarter of 2019. The income tax expense relating to the gain is estimated to be $22 million.
The transaction also includes two elements of contingent earnouts. The “First Earnout” is calculated based on a multiple of all future sales of existing and certain future derivative products to existing and future customers in each annual period from 2019 through 2022. The First Earnout may not exceed $35 million in total. The “Second Earnout” is calculated based on a multiple of future sales related to an existing product and program with an existing customer exceeding an annual threshold for each annual period from 2019 through 2022. The Second Earnout is not capped. For the Second Earnout, if the applicable sales in an annual period do not exceed the annual threshold, no amounts will be paid relative to such annual period; the sales in such annual period do not carry over to the next annual period. Due to the degree of uncertainty associated with estimating the future sales levels of the divested business and its underlying programs, and the lack of reliable predictive market information, the Company will recognize such earnout proceeds, if received, as additional gain on sale when such proceeds are realized or realizable. 
Products and Customers
Our Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and motions systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification, and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers (“OEM”) that build aircraft for the commercial, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEM’s, aircraft operators such as airlines and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense as well as the Federal Aviation Administration and airport operators. During 2018, this segment’s sales were divided 80% to the commercial transport market, 10% to the military aircraft market, 6% to the business jet market and 4% to other markets. Most of this segment’s sales are a result of contracts or purchase orders received from customers, placed on a day-to-day basis or for single year procurements rather than long-term multi-year contract commitments. On occasion, the Company does receive contractual commitments or blanket purchase orders from our customers covering multiple-year deliveries of hardware to our customers.
Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace, communications and weapons test systems as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics’ products are sold to a global customer base including OEMs and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. During 2018, this segment’s sales were divided 66% to the semiconductor market and 34% to the aerospace & defense market. 
Sales by segment, geographic region, major customer and foreign operations are provided in Note 19 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this report.
We have a significant concentration of business with two major customers; Panasonic Avionics Corporation (“Panasonic”) and The Boeing Company (“Boeing”). Sales to Panasonic accounted for 14.4% of sales in 2018, 19.1% of sales in 2017, and 21.6% of sales in 2016. Sales to Boeing accounted for 14.3% of sales in 2018, 16.8% of sales in 2017, and 15.2% of sales in 2016.
Strategy
Our strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and use those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to the aerospace & defense and other markets where our technology can be beneficial.
Practices as to Maintaining Working Capital
Liquidity is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report.
Competitive Conditions
We experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve, principally with respect to product performance and price, from various competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources. Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, customer support, responsiveness and cost management. We continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets.
Government Contracts
All U.S. government contracts, including subcontracts where the U.S. government is the ultimate customer, may be subject to termination at the election of the government. Our revenue stream relies on military spending. Approximately 14% of our consolidated sales were made to the military aircraft and military test systems markets combined.
Raw Materials
Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources. We believe that the loss of any one source, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term.
Seasonality
Our business is typically not seasonal.
Backlog
At December 31, 2018, our consolidated backlog was $416 million. Excluding backlog related to the divested semiconductor business, our backlog was $403 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2017, our backlog was $394 million. Backlog in the Aerospace segment was $326 million at December 31, 2018, of which $306 million is expected to be realized in 2019. Backlog in the Test Systems segment, exclusive of the backlog associated with the divested semiconductor business, was $77 million at December 31, 2018, of which $46 million is expected to be realized in 2019. 
Patents
We have a number of patents. While the aggregate protection of these patents is of value, our only material business that is dependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution products. Our patents and patent applications relate to electroluminescence, instrument panels, cord reels and handsets, and a broad patent covering the cabin power distribution technology. We regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and contractual arrangements to protect our rights. We have trademark protection in our major markets.
Research, Development and Engineering Activities
We are engaged in a variety of engineering and design activities as well as basic research and development activities directed to the substantial improvement or new application of our existing technologies. These costs are expensed when incurred and included in cost of sales. Research, development and engineering costs amounted to approximately $114.3 million in 2018, $95.0 million in 2017 and $88.9 million in 2016.
Employees
We employed approximately 2,700 employees at December 31, 2018. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We have approximately 200 hourly production employees at Peco who are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
