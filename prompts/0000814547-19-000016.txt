PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise, an approach we commonly refer to as decision management. Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection. We also help businesses improve non-customer decisions such as transaction and claims processing. Our solutions enable users to make decisions that are more precise, consistent and agile, and that systematically advance business goals. This helps our clients to reduce the cost of doing business, increase revenues and profitability, reduce losses from risks and fraud, and increase customer loyalty.
Our Segments
We categorize our products and services into the following three operating segments:

• | Applications. This segment includes pre-configured decision management applications designed for a specific type of business problem or process — such as marketing, account origination, customer management, fraud, collections and insurance claims management — as well as associated professional services. These applications are available to our customers as on-premises software, and many are available as hosted, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) applications through the FICO® Analytic Cloud or third-party public clouds, such as those provided by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).


• | Scores. This segment includes our business-to-business scoring solutions and services, our business-to-consumer scoring solutions and services including myFICO® solutions for consumers, and associated professional services. Our scoring solutions give our clients access to analytics that can be easily integrated into their transaction streams and decision-making processes. Our scoring solutions are distributed through major credit reporting agencies worldwide, as well as services through which we provide our scores to clients directly.


• | Decision Management Software. This segment is composed of analytic and decision management software tools that clients can use to create their own custom decision management applications, our FICO® Decision Management Suite, as well as associated professional services. These tools are available to our customers as on-premises software, through the FICO® Analytic Cloud or third-party public clouds, such as those provided by AWS.

Our Solutions
Our solutions involve four fundamental disciplines:

• | Analytics, which include predictive analytics that identify risks and opportunities associated with individual customers, prospects and transactions, in order to detect patterns such as risk and fraud, as well as optimization analytics that are used to improve the design of decision logic or “strategies.”


• | Data management and transaction profiling that bring extensive consumer information to every decision.


• | Software such as decision management systems that author and implement business rules, models and decision strategies, often in a real-time environment, as well as software for managing customer engagement.


• | Consulting services that help clients make the most of investments in FICO applications, tools and scores in the shortest possible time.

All of our solutions are designed to help businesses make decisions that are faster, more precise, more consistent and more agile, while reducing costs and risks incurred in making decisions. In addition, we offer our clients a portfolio of applications, tools and services in the cloud, which allow them to create, customize, deploy and manage powerful analytic services.

We also offer custom and consortium-based credit risk and application fraud models.
Customer Management Applications
Our customer strategy management products and services enable businesses to automate and improve risk-based decisions for their existing customers. These solutions help businesses apply advanced analytics in account and customer decisions to increase portfolio revenue, decrease risk exposure and losses, and reduce customer attrition, while improving operational efficiencies.
We provide customer strategy management solutions for banking, telecommunications and retail. FICO® TRIAD® Customer Manager, a leading credit management system, is available both on-premises and in the FICO® Analytic Cloud. The solution is an adaptive control system, which enables businesses to rapidly adapt to changing business and internal conditions by designing and testing new strategies in a “champion/challenger” environment. The current version enables users to manage risk and communications at both the account and customer level from a single platform. 
We market and sell FICO® TRIAD® Customer Manager software licenses, maintenance, consulting services, and strategy design and evaluation. Additionally, we provide TRIAD services and similar credit account management services through third-party credit card processors worldwide, including two of the largest processors in the U.S.
Fraud and Security Management Applications
Our fraud management products improve our clients’ profitability by predicting the likelihood a given transaction or customer account is experiencing fraud. Our fraud products analyze transactions in real time and generate recommendations for immediate action, which is critical to stopping third-party fraud, as well as first-party fraud and deliberate misuse of account privileges.
Our solutions are designed to detect and prevent a wide variety of fraud and risk types across multiple industries, including credit and debit payment card fraud; e-payment fraud; deposit account fraud; identity theft; healthcare fraud; Medicaid and Medicare fraud; and property and casualty insurance claims fraud, including workers’ compensation fraud. FICO fraud solutions protect financial institutions, insurance companies and government agencies from losses and damaged customer relationships caused by fraud and related criminal behavior.
Our leading fraud detection solution is the FICO® Falcon® Platform, recognized as a leader in global payment card fraud detection. The Falcon® Platform examines transaction, cardholder, account, customer, device and merchant data to detect a wide range of payment card fraud quickly and accurately utilizing artificial intelligence technology. It analyzes payment transactions in real time, assesses the risk of fraud in a fraud score, and provides the ability for user-defined variables and rules strategies to be used in conjunction with the fraud score to prevent fraud while expediting legitimate transactions. Adaptive analytics, a form of self-learning models, can also be employed to accelerate our customers’ response to evolving fraud tactics.
In September 2019, FICO introduced FICO® Falcon® X, a unified platform for the detection and investigation of both fraud and financial crimes. We also announced the FICO® Financial Crimes Studio, which allows banks’ data science teams to develop machine learning models using open source libraries, as well as FICO machine learning libraries, and then deploy the models on FICO® Falcon® X for operational use.
FICO® Fraud Predictor with Merchant Profiles is used in conjunction with the Falcon® Platform to improve fraud detection rates through the inclusion of merchant profiles, which is especially important for online transactions. Merchant profiles are built using fraud and transactional data that include characteristics revealing which merchants have a history of higher fraud volumes, and which purchase types and ticket sizes have most often been fraudulent at a particular merchant, among others.
FICO® Card Compromise Manager is used in conjunction with the FICO® Falcon® Platform to identify point-of-sale and e-commerce card compromises with analytically derived recommenced actions—such as card block and reissue, or watch-listing—to optimize loss prevention. Separately, the FICO® Card Alert Service prevents ATM debit fraud by identifying counterfeit payment cards and reporting them to issuers. The service analyzes daily transactions from participating networks and uses this data to identify common points of compromise and suspect cards most likely to incur fraud.
In addition to our Falcon® products, we offer a wide range of solutions focused on preventing and detecting a variety of financial crimes. FICO® Application Fraud Manager helps businesses prevent both first- and third-party fraud during the application process. By preventing fraud prior to account origination, we help our customers avoid future losses as well as unnecessary collections costs. FICO® Identity Resolution Engine helps organizations detect and investigate organized criminal behavior using graph analytics to identify entities and their connections across federated data sources.
FICO® Insurance Fraud Manager uses advanced unsupervised modeling techniques to detect health care claims fraud, abuse and errors as soon as unusual behavior patterns emerge. Insurance Fraud Manager is used by both public and private health care payers to detect and prevent fraud in both pre- and post-pay fraud investigation environments.
FICO offers a comprehensive modular set of compliance solutions to fight money-laundering, terrorist financing, and to fulfill custom requirements for governance, risk and compliance.
In August 2019, FICO acquired EZMCOM, Inc. (“EZMCOM”) to provide both identity proofing (“ID proofing”) and user authentication solutions. ID proofing is the digital process of on-boarding new customers without requiring face-to-face verification. The technology provides an extra layer of security that is easy to use, with minimal customer inconvenience, thereby preventing fraud as well as ensuring regulatory compliance standards such as e-KYC are met. User authentication is the real-time corroboration of an identity previously established to enable his or her access to an electronic or digital asset. As an authentication hub, FICO’s technology includes multifactor, biometric, and behavioral (user and device-based) capabilities.
FICO’s cybersecurity products utilize predictive analytics to deliver enterprise-level risk assessments. The FICO® Cyber Risk Score provides an empirically derived score that conveys the security posture of an organization and the likelihood of a material data breach in the next twelve months. The score is used to manage the cyber risk of an enterprise as well as to assess third-party risk that may be introduced by third-party partners and suppliers.
Collections & Recovery Applications
FICO® Debt Manager™, FICO® Debt Manager™ Pro, FICO® Debt Manager™ Pro Plus, FICO® PlacementsPlus® service and Placement OptimizerSM solution (collectively, the “FICO Debt Management Solutions”) automate the full cycle of collections and recovery, including early collections, late collections, asset disposal, agency placement and optimization, recovery, litigation, bankruptcy, asset management and residual balance recovery. PlacementsPlus service facilitates control over the distribution and management of accounts to agencies, attorneys, debt buyers and internal recovery departments. Placement Optimizer maximizes the effectiveness of the placement strategy once accounts are outsourced. FICO Debt Management Solutions also include assessments, models and scores, predictive analytics, advanced customer engagement and optimization. FICO® Debt Manager™ is available both on premises and in the FICO® Analytic Cloud.
Customer Communication Services
FICO® Customer Communication Services provide customer engagement, fraud resolution, and collection solutions in the cloud. It enables financial services institutions, utilities, telecommunications firms, insurers, and other businesses to engage in automated two-way communications. It allows businesses to reach customers in real time using short message service (“SMS”), mobile applications, automated voice, email and other channels; resolve matters such as verification of suspicious credit or debit card transactions; request missed payments; and resolve customer service issues. FICO® Customer Communication Services, combined with FICO’s decision management applications, allow businesses to execute and resolve customer interactions while improving customer outcomes.
Analytic Services
We perform custom predictive, descriptive and decision modeling and related analytic projects for clients in multiple industries to address business processes across the customer life cycle. This work leverages our analytic methodologies and expertise to solve risk management and marketing challenges for a single business, using that business’s data and industry best practices to develop a highly customized solution. Most of this work falls under predictive analytics, decision analysis and optimization, which provide greater insight into customer preferences and future customer behavior. Within decision analysis and optimization, we apply data and proprietary algorithms to the design of customer treatment strategies.
Scores
Our FICO® Scores are used in the majority of U.S. credit decisions, by nearly all of the major banks, credit card organizations, mortgage lenders and auto loan originators. These credit scores, developed based on third-party data, provide a consistent and objective measure of an individual’s credit risk. Credit grantors use our FICO® Scores in a variety of ways: to prescreen candidates for marketing programs; to evaluate applicants for new credit; and to manage existing customer accounts. FICO® Score is a three-digit score ranging from 300-850. They are calculated by running data from the three U.S. national credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, through one of several proprietary scoring models developed by FICO. Lenders generally pay the credit reporting agencies scoring fees based on usage, and the credit reporting agencies pay an associated fee to us. FICO® Score 9, the most recent version of the FICO® Score, was released in early fiscal 2015.
While the core FICO® Score is the foundation of our scoring portfolio, we offer a number of other broad-based scores, including several specific FICO® Industry Scores. We also develop various custom scores for our financial services clients. The FICO® Score XD expands the scorable population using alternative credit data. FICO® Score XD looks at public records and property data, and a consumer’s history with mobile, landline phone and cable payments, to generate scores on the same 300-850 scale as standard FICO® Scores. FICO® Score XD is available to lenders from LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Equifax. We also continue to innovate with respect to scores that consider consumer permissioned data from accounts such as checking, savings, or money market accounts. Incorporating consumer contributed data is a unique approach to helping empower consumers to establish or improve their creditworthiness by using data that reflects sound financial activity but that is not part of a traditional credit report. This can help consumers qualify for the credit they seek under more competitive terms. This approach is particularly helpful for consumers who may have very sparse or inactive credit files and are seeking a path toward greater financial inclusion in mainstream banking.
Outside the U.S., we offer FICO® Scores, including scores using alternative data, for consumers, and in some cases for small and medium enterprises, through credit reporting agencies. We also have installed client-specific versions of the FICO® Score in over 10 countries. Like FICO® Scores in the U.S., these scores help lenders in multiple countries leverage the FICO® Score’s predictive analysis to assess the risk of marketing prospects and credit applicants. FICO® Scores are in use or being implemented in 30 different countries across five continents outside the U.S.
We also have scoring systems for insurance underwriters and marketers. They use the same underlying statistical technology as our FICO® Scores, but are designed to predict applicant or policyholder insurance loss ratio for automobile or homeowners’ coverage. Our insurance scores are available in the U.S. and Canada. We license credit bureau scoring services and related consulting directly to users in banking through the FICO® PreScore® service for prescreening solicitation candidates.
We also provide FICO® Score based products, education and information on FICO® Scores to consumers. They are distributed directly by us through our myFICO® service and through licensed distribution partners, including Experian and certain lenders, for use in customer and non-customer programs.
The myFICO® products and subscription offerings are available online at www.myfico.com. Consumers can use the myFICO.com website to purchase their FICO® Scores, including credit reports associated with the scores, explanations of the factors affecting their scores, and customized information on how to manage their scores. We make available the 28 most widely used versions of the FICO® Score from the three major U.S. credit bureaus through our myFICO® service, representing approximately 95% of all FICO® Scores sold and used by lenders. Customers can use products to simulate how taking specific actions could affect their FICO® Score 8. Consumers can also subscribe to monitoring services, which deliver alerts via email and text when changes to a user’s FICO® Scores or other credit report content are detected. In addition, consumers can purchase identity theft monitoring products that alert consumers of potential risks of identity fraud with comprehensive detection and identity restoration services.
Decision Management Software
We provide analytic and decision management platforms and tools that businesses use to build their own tailored, analytically powered decision management applications on-premises, within the FICO® Analytic Cloud or via third-party cloud environments such as AWS. In contrast to our packaged applications developed for specific industry solutions, our tools platform adds scalable and flexible decision management capabilities to virtually any application or operational system. These tools are sold as licensed software or as a platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”) offering in the cloud, and can be used standalone, or in conjunction with third-party solutions to advance a client’s decision management initiatives. We use these tools as common software components for our own decision management solutions, described above in the Applications section. They are also key components of our decision management architecture. We also partner with third-party providers within given industry markets and with major software companies to embed our tools within existing applications.

TECHNOLOGY
We specialize in analytics software and decision management technologies that analyze data and drive decision strategies and customer engagement. We maintain active research in a number of fields for the purposes of deriving greater insight and predictive value from data, making various forms of data more usable and valuable to the model-building process, and automating and applying analytics to the various business processes involved in making high-volume decisions in real time.
We are widely recognized as a leader in predictive analytics due to our pioneering work in credit scoring and fraud detection. We believe that our tools and processes are among the very best commercially available, and that we are uniquely able to integrate advanced analytic, software and data technologies into mission-critical business solutions that offer superior returns on investment.
In fiscal 2019, we continued to make progress with our FICO® Decision Management Suite and FICO® Decision Management Platform initiatives. Most significantly for the fiscal year, we have added distinct FICO intellectual property into tools to develop explainable artificial intelligence or xAI. In addition, we have made many of our software solutions, which were previously available only as on-premises software installations, into SaaS solutions hosted on the FICO® Analytic Cloud and/or in AWS. The FICO® Decision Management Suite enables clients to use FICO tools, along with rapid application development tools and visualization tools, to quickly develop their own decision management applications and services. We continue to add functionality to the platform as well as host additional FICO applications in the cloud. These ongoing initiatives are driven by enhancing our core technical capabilities listed below, and extending them through partnerships with other technology providers as well as through employing open source software.
Principal Areas of Expertise
Predictive Modeling. Predictive modeling identifies and mathematically represents underlying relationships in historical data in order to explain the data and make predictions or classifications about future events. Our models summarize large quantities of data to amplify its value. Predictive models typically analyze current and historical data on individuals to produce easily understood metrics such as scores. These scores rank-order individuals by likely future performance, e.g., their likelihood of making credit payments on time, or of responding to a particular offer for services. We also include in this category models that detect the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent. Our predictive models are frequently operationalized in mission-critical transactional systems and drive decisions and actions in near real time. A number of analytic methodologies underlie our products in this area. These include proprietary applications of both linear and nonlinear mathematical programming algorithms, in which one objective is optimized within a set of constraints, and advanced neural systems, which learn complex patterns from large data sets to predict the probability that a new individual will exhibit certain behaviors of business interest. We also apply various related statistical techniques for analysis and pattern detection within large datasets, and have enhanced our abilities to derive insights and predictive variables from various forms of so-called big data, including unstructured data, such as text. We have enhanced our predictive analytic capabilities to include the development of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. FICO has focused on making artificial intelligence explainable to auditors, developers and decision makers.
Decision Analysis and Optimization. Decision analysis refers to the broad quantitative field that deals with modeling, analyzing and optimizing decisions made by individuals, groups and organizations. Whereas predictive models analyze multiple aspects of individual behavior to forecast future behavior, decision analysis analyzes multiple aspects of a given decision to identify the most effective action to take to reach a desired result. We have developed an integrated approach to decision analysis that incorporates the development of a decision model that mathematically maps the entire decision structure; proprietary optimization technology that identifies the most effective strategies, given both the performance objective and constraints; the development of designed testing required for active, continuous learning; and the robust extrapolation of an optimized strategy to a wider set of scenarios than historically encountered. Our optimization capabilities also include a proprietary mathematical modeling and programming language, an easy-to-use development environment, and a state-of-the-art set of optimization algorithms.
Transaction Profiling. Transaction profiling is a patent-protected technique used to extract meaningful information and reduce the complexity of transaction data used in modeling. Many of our products operate using transactional data, such as credit card purchase transactions, or other types of data that change over time. In its raw form, this data is very difficult to use in predictive models for several reasons. First, an isolated transaction contains very little information about the behavior of the individual who generated the transaction. In addition, transaction patterns change rapidly over time. Finally, this type of data can often be highly complex. To overcome these issues, we have developed a set of techniques that transform raw transactional data into a mathematical representation that reveals latent information, and which make the data more usable by predictive models. This profiling technology accumulates data across multiple transactions of many types to create and update profiles of transaction patterns. These profiles enable our neural network models to efficiently and effectively make accurate assessments of, for example, fraud risk and credit risk within real-time transaction streams.
Customer Data Integration. Decisions made on customers or prospects can benefit from data stored in multiple sources, both inside and outside the enterprise. We have focused on developing data integration processes that are able to assemble and integrate those disparate data sources into a unified view of the customer or household, through the application of persistent keying technology. This data can include structured or unstructured data. Recent innovations include a solution that can integrate multiple data sources in real time and make them available for analysis and decisions.
 Decision Management Software. In order to make a decision strategy operational, various steps and rules need to be programmed or exported into the business's software infrastructure, where they can communicate with front-end, customer-facing systems and back-end systems such as billing systems. We have developed software systems, sometimes known as decision engines and decision rules management systems, which perform the necessary functions to execute a decision strategy. Our software includes very efficient programs for these functions, facilitating, for example, business user definition of extremely complex decision strategies using graphical user interfaces; simultaneous testing of hundreds of decision strategies in “champion/challenger” (test/control) mode; high-volume processing and analysis of transactions in real time; integration of multiple data sources; and execution of predictive models for improved behavior forecasts and finer segmentation. Decision management software is an integral part of our decision management applications, described earlier.
Customer Engagement. We have advanced technology for customer engagement, which enables the execution of decisions and customer contact through SMS, email, automated voice, mobile applications and other channels. This technology enables FICO to extend decision management beyond the rendering of the decision to the final resolution with a customer, using the most effective method of communication for a given event and customer. Integrating this technology with our decision management systems has proven to decrease costs, improve staff efficiency, increase customer satisfaction and improve the return from marketing, fraud and collections activities.
Social Network Analysis. We have advanced technology for identity resolution and social network analysis, which enables users to understand the relationships between their organization, customers, events, and third-party actors. Businesses can perform real-time searches across their enterprise data to find, match, and link similar entities and uncover hidden relationship between people, places and things. This technology complements FICO’s capabilities in the area of fraud and marketing analytics.
Cybersecurity. We have advanced services for cyber risk assessment, which enable users to understand the likelihood their organization or a third-party organization that is their partner, supplier, or potential supplier will suffer a material data breach within a forward-looking 12-month period. These services are used by organizations to track and monitor their own cyber risk for self-assessment and to assess and monitor partner and supplier enterprises for third-party risk assessment. They are also used by insurance underwriters to assess cyber risk for cyber breach insurance policies.
PRODUCT PROTECTION AND TRADEMARKS
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements and procedures to protect our proprietary rights.
We retain the title to and protect the suite of models and software used to develop scoring models as a trade secret. We also restrict access to our source code and limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. We have generally relied upon the laws protecting trade secrets and upon contractual nondisclosure safeguards and restrictions on transferability to protect our software and proprietary interests in our product and service methodology and know-how. Our confidentiality procedures include invention assignment and proprietary information agreements with our employees and independent contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with our distributors, strategic partners and customers. We also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.
We have patents on many of our technologies and have patent applications pending on other technologies. The patents we hold may not be upheld as valid and may not prevent the development of competitive products. In addition, patents may never be issued on our pending patent applications or on any future applications that we may submit. We currently hold 178 U.S. and 17 foreign patents with 101 applications pending.
Despite our precautions, it may be possible for competitors or users to copy or reproduce aspects of our software or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Patents and other protections for our intellectual property are important, but we believe our success and growth will depend principally on such factors as the knowledge, ability, experience and creative skills of our personnel, new products, frequent product enhancements and name recognition.
We have developed technologies for research projects conducted under agreements with various U.S. government agencies or their subcontractors. Although we have acquired commercial rights to these technologies, the U.S. government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies that we develop under these contracts. In some cases, the U.S. government can terminate our rights to these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis. In addition, under U.S. government contracts, the government may make the results of our research public, which could limit our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on funded research.
We have used, registered and/or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks for our technologies, products and services. We currently have 34 trademarks registered in the U.S. and select foreign countries.
