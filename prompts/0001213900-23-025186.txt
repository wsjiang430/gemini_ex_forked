Under the terms of the Merger Agreement we entered into with TMNA and representatives of the shareholders of each of TMNA and the company (“Merger Agreement”), TMNA contributed its ownership of Tingo Mobile to a newly organized holding company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“Tingo BVI Sub”). TMNA then merged Tingo BVI Sub with and into MICT Fintech Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company organized in the British Virgin Islands (“MICT Fintech”), resulting in Tingo Mobile being wholly-owned by the Company (hereinafter, the “Merger”).

Key Terms of Series A Preferred Stock. Upon the approval of our stockholders, the Series A Preferred Stock will convert into 20.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, calculated as of the closing date of the Merger. If such shareholder approval is not obtained by June 30, 2023, all issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock must be redeemed by us in exchange for TMNA receiving 27% of the total issued and outstanding shares of Tingo Group Holdings, LLC, a Delaware-incorporated subsidiary of the company (“TGH”) that is the immediate parent company of MICT Fintech, which in turn would reduce the Company’s interests in TGH and therefore Tingo Mobile by 27%. See TGH Group Structure below.

Acquisition of Tingo Foods




Overview. On February 9, 2023, the company and MICT Fintech acquired from Dozy Mmobuosi, Tingo Mobile Founder and Chief Executive Officer all of the outstanding share capital of Tingo Foods PLC (“Tingo Foods”), a Nigerian public limited company that has operated in the food processing industry since its inception in September 2022. As part of its expansion strategy, Tingo Foods plans to fit out and operate a state-of-the-art food processing facility in the Delta State of Nigeria, which is expected to be the largest of its kind in Africa and scheduled for completion by the end of the first half of 2024. We agreed to fit out the Tingo Foods facility with the necessary processing equipment and further agreed to require Tingo Foods to enter into a long-term ground lease for the facility, with lease payments to commence when the facility becomes operational.




Consideration Provided. As consideration for Tingo Foods, we issued Mr. Mmobuosi a senior secured promissory note in the principal amount of $204 million, bearing interest at 5.0% per annum and maturing in 24 months.



About Tingo Group Holdings



TGH (and together with its subsidiaries, the “TGH Group”) is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. TGH is the leading Agri-Fintech company operating in Africa, with a comprehensive portfolio of innovative products, including a ‘device as a service’ smartphone and pre-loaded platform product. As part of its globalization strategy, TGH and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tingo Mobile Limited (“Tingo Mobile”), have recently begun to expand internationally and entered into trade partnerships that are contracted to increase the number of subscribed farmers from 9.3 million in 2022 to more than 32 million, providing them with access to services including, among others, the Nwassa ’seed-to-sale’ marketplace platform, insurance, micro-finance, and mobile phone and data top-up. Tingo Group’s other Tingo business verticals include: TingoPay, a SuperApp in partnership with Visa that offers a wide range of B2C and B2B services including payment services, an e-wallet, foreign exchange and merchant services; Tingo Foods, a food processing business that processes raw foods into finished products such as rice, pasta and noodles; and Tingo DMCC, a commodity trading platform and agricultural commodities export business based out of the Dubai Multi Commodities Center.



Tingo Mobile’s Nwassa platform is believed to be Africa’s leading digital agriculture ecosystem that empowers rural farmers and agri-businesses by using proprietary technology that enables users to access markets in which they operate. Using Tingo Mobile’s ecosystem, farmers can ship produce from farms throughout Nigeria, in both retail and wholesale quantities. Tingo Mobile’s system provides real-time pricing, straight from the farms, which eliminates middlemen. The customers of Nwassa users pay for produce bought using available pricing on the platform.



Although TGH has a large retail subscriber base, its business model is essentially a business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”) model. Each of TGH’s current subscribers is a member of one of a small number of cooperatives with whom a subsidiary of TGH has a contractual relationship, which facilitates the distribution of Tingo-branded smartphones into the various rural communities of user farmers/agri-workers. Through TGH’s smartphones and proprietary applications imbedded in the phones, TGH is able to provide a wider array of agri-fintech services and generate diverse revenue streams as described in more detail herein.



Services offered to TGH’s retail subscribers include smart phone leasing, an agri-marketplace, airtime top ups, utility payment services, bill-pay and e-wallet, insurance products and access to finance and lending services. The TGH Group offers its services to the agricultural market through the Nwassa platform and has recently launched a general B2C and B2B fintech platform and super-app, in partnership with Visa, branded as TingoPay.



On October 19, 2022, Tingo Mobile, signed an agreement with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), the umbrella body of the 56 recognized commodities and agricultural associations in Nigeria. Under the terms of the agreement, AFAN committed to add a minimum of 20 million additional subscribers to Tingo Mobile’s customer base. These new subscribers are expected to be comprised principally of owners of small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises throughout the country.



On November 10, 2022, Tingo Mobile opened a new regional head office in Ghana and launched operations there. In conjunction with the launch, Tingo Mobile also announced an agreement with the Ashanti Investment Trust, the investment arm of the Ashanti Kingdom, to enroll a minimum of 2 million new members in Ghana with Tingo Mobile within 120 days of signing and has agreed on a target to increase such enrollments to at least 4 million members.



On December 14, 2022, Tingo Mobile launched in Malawi as a strategic base from which to expand into East Africa and target neighboring countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique.

In addition to its agri-fintech business, on December 12, 2022, TGH launched its global commodities trading platform and export business (“Tingo DMCC”) from the Dubai Multi Commodity Centre (the “DMCC”) to facilitate offtake and export of agricultural commodities from both its existing customer base and new customers. Through the strong relationships between Tingo Mobile and the cooperatives and other parties it deals with in Nigeria and Ghana, TGH has secured access to significant quantities of agricultural produce for export, including wheat, millet, cassava, ginger, cashew nuts, cocoa and cotton.



On February 9, 2023, TGH acquired the entire share capital of Tingo Foods, which commenced food processing operations in September 2022, generating more than $400 million of revenue in its first four months of trading. Through Tingo Foods, the TGH Group expects to enhance its ability to integrate agricultural producers into the ’seed to sale’ value chain and digital ecosystem.



A key element of the growth plans for Tingo Foods is the development of its own food processing facility. To this end, through a joint venture, Tingo Foods has committed to build and operate a state-of-the-art $1.6 billion food processing facility in the Delta State of Nigeria, which is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2024. Tingo Foods estimates that its part of the build and fit-out costs will amount to approximately $500 million, which it expects to fund out of a combination of retained earnings and debt finance. The new facility is expected to multiply the size of Tingo Food’s processing capacity and revenues, allowing it to expand its current product range of rice, pasta, noodles, and other staple foods into new product areas such as tea, coffee, cereals, chocolate, biscuits, cooking oils, non-dairy milks, carbonated drinks, and mineral water, while also materially expanding its capacity for the offtake of produce from its farmers and increasing its supply into TGH’s commodity trading platform and export business. In line with its Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) commitments, Tingo Foods has entered into a partnership with a third party company in the UK, Evtec Energy Plc, who have committed to fund and build a $150 million net zero carbon emission solar plant, to provide a sustainable and low-cost energy source to power its multi-billion dollar food processing facility. Through this first-of-its-kind facility in Nigeria, Tingo Foods aims to reduce Africa’s reliance on the import of finished food and beverage products and to increase exports of made-in-Africa produce, which in turn is expected to reduce the prices of finished products and significantly reduce shipping miles and carbon emissions.



As part of the TGH Group’s strategy to leverage its fintech platforms, infrastructure and the Tingo brand, it recently launched the TingoPay Super App in partnership with Visa. TingoPay broadens TGH’s reach outside of the agricultural sector, targeting retail customers of any age (18+) and demographic. TingoPay customers can apply for a Tingo Visa card and then access it via the TingoPay Super App, so as to make online transactions in their domestic or foreign currencies, as well as to manage their cards, set up repeat payments and access transaction statements. The Tingo Visa card’s interface with the TingoPay super app and e-wallet also allows customers to use their digital money easily and securely for both online and physical payments anywhere Visa is accepted. Additionally, TingoPay’s users can benefit from a broad selection of value-added services, including the ability to pay utilities and bills, top-up airtime and data, make funds and forex transfers, apply for loans, arrange pensions, purchase insurance products, make travel bookings and access the Nwassa agricultural produce marketplace. TingoPay and the Tingo Visa partnership are also expected to deliver significant benefits to businesses, in particular farmers and other Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across all sectors. The integration of Visa’s range of merchant services with TingoPay’s commerce portal and the Nwassa marketplace, enables businesses to accept payments easily and securely in any currency from both retail and business customers, and use the TingoPay e-wallet to immediately fund purchases of inputs and make other payments.



TGH has an experienced management team, led by Dozy Mmobuosi, who founded Tingo Mobile in 2001 and serves as the TGH Group CEO. Mr. Mmobuosi is supported by an executive management team and has additional senior management personnel within each of its subsidiaries who are responsible for executing the TGH Group’s business strategy and day-to-day operations.



The TGH Group currently has trading operations in Nigeria, Ghana and Malawi in connection with Tingo Mobile, TingoPay and Tingo Foods, and Dubai in connection with the commodity trading platform and export business. In addition, TGH Group has administrative offices in the United States and the United Kingdom, which handle certain of the management and finance activities of the Company.

TGH Strategy



The TGH Group aims to be the leading fintech and agri-fintech business in Africa, before expanding into Southeast Asia and certain other parts of the world, delivering financial inclusion and financial upliftment to its customers, including to rural farming communities through the Company’s agri-fintech platform and products.




● | ESG Initiatives. Global climate change provides a challenge to sustainable production and food security. A key area of global interest under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) impact investing is social upliftment. TGH’s strategy and market execution naturally includes ESG principles and provides an opportunity to address SDGs, including food security, in Africa and globally. TGH seeks to accomplish this through its full range of agri-fintech products, including its Nwassa platform, its global commodity platform and export business and its Tingo Food food processing business. As noted above, TGH aims to align with SDGs and related initiatives, such as gender equality through upliftment of female entrepreneurship, financial inclusion, poverty alleviation and zero hunger.

● | Strategic Initiatives. TGH opportunistically reviews potential partnerships and mergers and acquisitions. TGH intends to identify key strategic partners and potential acquisitions that it believes can accelerate the TGH Group’s expansion towards becoming the leading agri-fintech operator in Africa, Southeast Asia and other emerging markets. TGH believes that pursuing a select number of investments in the agri-tech, banking services and fintech sectors can provide a strong pathway to enhance its proven activities in Nigeria and replicate them elsewhere, and TGH will continuously evaluate such opportunities. As TGH continues to grow, it intends to develop further strategic relationships and projects related to enhancing and expanding its capabilities and the development of the services that the TGH Group offers.

● | Agri-Fintech and Value-Added Services. TGH generates income from agri-fintech and value-added services, including, but not limited to: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mobile device leasing ‘Device-as-a-Service’ (12-month contracts); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Airtime and data top-ups; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nwassa (Agri-marketplace platform and value added transaction services); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilities and other bill pay services through its electronic wallet solution; and

● | Logistics services, including loading, unloading, transport, and delivery; and

● | Food Processing Services. In connection with the acquisition of Tingo Foods, TGH aims to become the preferred buyer of surplus agricultural produce in Africa and elsewhere, and a leading processor of finished food and beverage products. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Tingo Foods’ goal in Africa is to reduce the continent’s reliance on the import of finished food and beverage products and increase its exports of made-in-Africa produce between countries within the continent, as well as to the rest of the world. This is expected to reduce the prices of finished goods for Africa’s consumers, while also creating a substantial environmental benefit by reducing the current need to export raw food materials outside of the continent for processing only to then import the finished and more expensive products back into Africa. To enable Tingo Foods to significantly accelerate its growth and increase capacity, it has entered into a joint venture to construct and operate a $1.6 billion state-of-the-art food processing facility in Nigeria, which is expected to the largest of its kind in Africa. Tingo Foods expects to construct and open more food processing facilities in Africa and other key markets as it grows and as it secures the supply of more agricultural produce through Nwassa platform using Tingo Mobile.




● | Key Strategies. TGH intends to achieve growth and build competitive advantages through the following key strategies: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing the number of TGH users in Nigeria, including through new partnerships with additional agricultural cooperatives; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extending TGH’s services to other African countries, in addition to Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, where the TGH Group currently operates — these may include Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique, Uganda and Kenya. TGH is conducting a detailed review with its corporate advisors to determine how best it can optimize and develop market entry strategies based on its proven success in Nigeria and, most recently, Ghana and Malawi; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the medium term, expanding TGH’s services to countries outside of Africa, including China, other countries in Southeast Asia and certain countries in South America; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding the Tingo DMCC commodity platform and export business across the globe; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing the food and beverage processing capacity of Tingo Foods, including in to other countries within Africa and into other parts of the world; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further diversifying the TGH B2C and B2B customer base outside of the agricultural sector, with products such as TingoPay, Tingo Visa products, new app based products and a range of payment and foreign exchange services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TGH Group Structure



The TGH Group structure has been organized to facilitate expansion within Africa, the integration of Tingo Foods into the company’s agricultural value chain, as well as the creation of TGH’s commodity export financing subsidiary in Dubai. The organizational structure of the TGH Group is represented in the following diagram (other non-agri-fintech subsidiaries of the company not shown):
Operations and Business Model



A key challenge in Africa’s agricultural value chain is the weak link between rural small holder farmers and demand centers in urban areas. TGH has developed the Nwassa platform to connect farmers directly with wholesale and retail purchasers, as well as experienced experts and suppliers. Farmers and farm cooperatives connect with brokers, arrange for storage and transportation of their produce, and ultimately obtain improved economic outcomes through higher product prices and lower storage and transportation losses. Since the launch of Nwassa in 2020  adoption and usage of the platform has grown rapidly.



Approximately 98% of TGH’s customers are active users of the Nwassa platform, and the platform processes approximately $1 billion USD in gross transaction value (GTV) on a monthly basis. In addition, TGH has invested in a cell-on-wheels platform to boost network and wireless coverage in regions with low wireless coverage in an effort to ensure its customers have consistent access to TGH services and Nwassa whenever such is required.



We believe that, as the TGH Group’s business continues to grow, it is positioned to benefit from operating leverage and economies of scale. In particular, TGH is able to provide incremental value-added services to its large customer base.




● | Customers. TGH, principally through Tingo Mobile, its wholly-owned subsidiary, has consistently maintained over 9.3 million customers since 2014, with a focus on supporting customers who primarily work in the agricultural sector, which is now expected to grow through the recently signed trade partnerships with the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, who have contracted to enrol a minimum of 20 million new farmers, and the Kingdom of Ashanti in Ghana, who have contracted to enrol between 2 million and 4 million+ farmers, as well as the recent launch into Malawi, and other such geographical expansion and new trade partnerships in the future. Tingo Mobile has been able to do this though a unique and efficient B2B2C business model. A member of the TGH Group contracts with farming cooperatives and other associations who engage their large agricultural customers to utilize Tingo’s products and services. TGH’s customers are a mix of farmers (small holder and subsistence), and individuals who work in storage, transportation and logistics across the agricultural value chain. The number of customers stated above represents the number of mobile handset devices that have been distributed, with 1 year (12 month) contracts, to members of TGH’s partner farmers’ cooperatives and those making monthly (12) lease payments, via the cooperatives, to TGH. TGH then provides additional services to the members of the cooperatives as described herein, primarily through the Nwassa platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. | Low Attrition. 
---+-------------------


● | Because TGH contracts with agricultural cooperatives and associations who facilitate access to branded mobile devices and services to their members, attrition or “churn” rates have been consistently less than 1% over the last nine years. The members of the farmers’ cooperatives have the option to sign up to TGH’s non-cancellable agreements for a 1-year leasing period. While these are non-cancelable agreements, there are instances whereby the farmers may cease making payments. However, as noted above, there has been a churn rate of less than 1% over each leasing cycle. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer count and activity on TGH’s various platforms are key drivers of its revenue. TGH currently generates revenue from the following sources: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Outright Sales of Mobile Phones. In 2020, Tingo Mobile sold 3.1 million handsets to a distributor based in Kenya, and in Q4 2021 Tingo Mobile sold an additional 2.9 million handsets to a non-agricultural cooperative in Nigeria. In Q3 2022, Tingo Mobile sold an additional 87,508 mobile devices in a bulk sale. TGH will likely seek to pursue similar sales opportunities in the future. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mobile Voice and Data Service. Through a Mobile Virtual Network agreement with Airtel, Tingo Mobile provides its customers in Nigeria with voice and data services. Each month its customers receive 2,500 airtime minutes, 10 free SMS text messages outside the Tingo network, 100 free SMS messages within the Tingo network and 500 MB data for a monthly access fee of circa $3.00 USD (using 414 USD/NGN exchange rate) per month. This fee is shared with Airtel, of which TGH’s share (16%) equates to USD $0.48 per user per month. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nwassa Platform. TGH’s proprietary platform, Nwassa, supports Nigeria’s agricultural value chain with market access and provides users with a variety of agri-tech and fintech services, including: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Access to agricultural markets for crops, packaging, warehousing, and cargo logistics;

Separate to its Tingo Mobile, Nwassa and TingoPay businesses, TGH has diversified into the Tingo DMCC commodity trading platform and export business and the Tingo Foods food processing business, both of which aim to meet the globe’s increasing shortfall in food and beverage product supply and to tackle the world’s food security crisis. Tingo DMCC and Tingo Foods currently generate revenues from the following sources:




● | Tingo DMCC. The commodity trading platform and export business of Tingo DMCC facilitates through its operations in Dubai the sales of agricultural produce from farming cooperatives in Africa, as well as from other suppliers, and brokers the sale of such produce to distribution companies, wholesalers, supermarket groups and other large-volume buyers wherever they are in the world. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tingo Foods. Having commenced trading in September 2022, Tingo Foods was acquired by TGH on February 9, 2023. To date, Tingo Foods has outsourced its processing activities to third-party food processing plants in Nigeria, for which Tingo Foods arranges the supply of raw crops, as well as the customers for the finished processed foods. Tingo Foods aims to open its own state-of-the-art food processing facility in Nigeria by the end of the first half of 2024, which will enable it to significantly expand its product range and also multiply the size of its processing capacity and revenues.

Competition



In Nigeria and the other African countries in which TGH operates, it competes with a large number of mobile phone carriers. Current competitors may seek to intensify their investments in those markets and also expand their businesses into new markets. Competitive pressure from current or future competitors or TGH’s failure to quickly and effectively adapt to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect its growth. Current or future competitors may offer lower prices and enhanced features, and, as a result, TGH may be forced to lower its prices and upgrade its phones and network in order to maintain its market share.



With respect to TGH’s payment services, TGH faces competition from financial institutions that offer payment processing services, debit and credit card service providers, other offline payment options and other electronic payment system operators, in each of the markets in which TGH operates. TGH expects competition to intensify in the future, as existing and new competitors may introduce new services or enhance existing services. New entrants tied to established brands may engender greater user confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services.



We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the Tingo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of the Tingo network and is an important element in attracting new users. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in TGH’s markets increases. Successful promotion of the Tingo brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of TGH’s marketing efforts and its ability to ensure that the Tingo network remains reliable, and useful at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses TGH incurs in building its brand. If TGH fails to successfully promote and maintain its brand or incurs substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain its brand, TGH may fail to attract new customers and cooperative partners or to grow or maintain its telecommunications network.



If TGH fails to compete effectively, it may lose existing users and fail to attract new users, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.



Market and Industry Trends



Africa is the second-largest continent by land mass and population. The continent is also the youngest by far, with a median age of 19.7 years for its 1.3 billion people in 2020. Tingo believes the building blocks for growth in Africa’s agriculture industry are in place and that it is well positioned to participate in the growth of this key demographic segment.



In a report by The Economist, Sub-Saharan Africa’s population is growing at a pace of 2.7% per year, which is more than twice as fast as the populations of South Asia 1.2% and Latin America 0.9%. At the current growth rate, the continent’s population will double by 2050. Africa’s younger population represents a significant opportunity for growth in the demand for agricultural commodities. This younger generation is also being born into a “networked” world and is more comfortable using technology to achieve their goals. In addition, Africa’s governments are increasingly focused on improving business conditions for entrepreneurs and small businesses on the continent. Sub-Saharan Africa’s World Bank Doing Business rank has improved by approximately 20 points: from 45 in 2004 to 65 in 2020. This trend appears likely to continue and will encourage the establishment of new ventures across a variety of economic sectors, including agriculture.



Foreign direct investment (FDI) to African countries hit a record $83 billion in 2021, according to UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2022 published on 9 June. This was more than double the amount reported in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic weighed heavily on investment flows to the continent. Despite the strong growth, investment flows to Africa accounted for only 5.2% of global FDI, up from 4.1% in 2020. Foreign direct investments into Africa will likely continue to help resolve significant infrastructure constraints and create value in the agricultural sector.

Nigeria is the largest economy and the most populous country in Africa and is therefore central to the continent’s growth. According to an Oxford Business Group 2021 report, agriculture accounts for 14% of total GDP in sub-Saharan Africa, and a majority of the continent’s population is employed in the sector. Agriculture is therefore central to African livelihoods as many of sub-Saharan Africans are small holder farmers and the FAO estimates that Africa holds 60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land.



In Nigeria, the agricultural industry employs 36% of the labour force and represents 22% of the country’s GDP according to a PWC report. Despite the scale of the agricultural industry in Nigeria, relative productivity remains disappointing. Nigeria’s suboptimal agricultural productivity is driven by several factors, including broken linkages to demand centers, inefficient capital allocation for the purchase of inputs, and underdeveloped and fragmented access to services. Tingo aims to play a significant role in resolving these issues.



Technology, Manufacturing and Distribution



TGH continuously invests in its technology, data collection and analytics capabilities, operating primarily through TGH-employed developers in Nigeria. TGH’s research and development activities focus on the production, maintenance and operation of new and existing products and services. We believe the development of TGH’s technology serves as an investment in future growth that will enhance consumer experience and satisfaction. We may seek to increase investments into TGH’ technology and data capabilities in the future.



In March 2020, Tingo Mobile entered into a mobile phone procurement contract with UGC Technologies Company Limited, with located in Shenze Town, China. In January 2022, Tingo Mobile entered into an agreement with Bullitt Mobile Limited, based in Reading, England, who are a supplier of branded cellular telephone products and accessories. We made the decision to diversify Tingo Mobile’s supplier base given the many challenges experienced by companies with globally distributed supply chains through the Covid-19 pandemic.



UGC Technologies Company Limited and Bullitt Mobile Limited are the TGH Group’s sole suppliers of mobile phones at present. The procurement contract with UGC Technologies Company Limited allows TGH to raise purchase orders in line with its customer demand and provides capacity to meet demand from wholesale customers. In addition, TGH is exploring opportunities to establish relationships with other production partners.



Intellectual Property



Intellectual property rights are important to TGH’s business. We rely on copyright laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. However, these laws provide only limited protection. Although we takes steps to protect the TGH Group’s intellectual property rights, we cannot be certain that the steps taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent unauthorized access, use or copying. Moreover, others may seek to infringe on, misappropriate, or otherwise violate TGH’s intellectual property rights. Policing the unauthorized use of TGH’s intellectual property rights can be difficult. The enforcement of TGH’s intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming, and may not be successful, even when TGH’s rights have been infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated.



In addition, aspects of TGH’s platform and services include software covered by open-source licenses. The terms of various open-source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on TGH’s services.



Although TGH relies on intellectual property rights in its business, it also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its intellectual property rights through appropriate technological restrictions, such as physical and electronic security measures.





10







Employees, Contract Personnel and Human Capital Resources



TGH employs approximately 30 executive, marketing, and administrative personnel, inclusive of its executive officers. The TGH Group has approximately 409 full-time employees, 38 part-time employees, and approximately 20,000 part-time, commission-only self-employed agents who work with TGH’s farmer cooperatives and the All Farmers Association of Nigeria. The self-employed agents act representatives and liaisons between Tingo Mobile, the cooperatives / AFAN and the farmers enrolled with Tingo Mobile and the Nwassa platform, assisting the farmers to utilize the services of Tingo Mobile and Nwassa and generate more transaction throughput, and to deal with any customer services requirements.



TGH understands that its success depends on its ability to attract, train and retain its employees and contract personnel. TGH strives to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs, learning and development opportunities that support career growth and advancement opportunities, and employee engagement initiatives that foster a strong company culture.



Facilities



The TGH Group’s largest office is in Lagos, Nigeria, where the bulk of its operations and support personnel are located. Tingo also has offices located in Accra in Ghana, Lilongwe in Malawi and in Dubai.



In the United States and the United Kingdom, TGH subleases office space on a month-to-month basis.



Government Regulation



Telecommunications Regulation



NCC Act. The primary statute and set of regulations governing the telecommunications sector in Nigeria is the Nigerian Communications Act (2003) (the “NCC Act”) and regulations made under it. Also relevant are the Wireless Telegraphy Act (1966), as amended (the “WT Act”), Cybercrimes (Prohibition Prevention, Etc.) Act (2015), the National Information Technology Development Agency Act (2007) and, to the extent that telecommunications companies may wish to use spectra ordinarily reserved for broadcast, the National Broadcast Commission Act (1992) and the respective regulations made under these statutes. The NCC Act is the key regulatory framework for the Nigerian telecommunications industry. The NCC Act stipulates rules relating to the classes of licenses, licensing processes and offenses for failure to comply with the provisions of the Act. It established the Nigerian Communications Commission (“NCC”) as a federal agency and regulator charged with the responsibility of facilitating investments in and entry into the Nigerian market for the provision and supply of communication services, equipment and facilities, granting and renewing communications spectrum and operating licenses and the promotion of fair competition in the communications.



Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The NCC is the independent national regulatory authority for the telecommunications industry in Nigeria. It is responsible for stimulating investments in the sector and creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry. The NCC is mandated to monitor all significant matters relating to the performance of all licensed telecommunications service providers and publish annual reports. The powers of the NCC range from the issuance of various licenses relating to the provision of communications services, equipment, and products, to regulating competition, issuing spectrum and numbering resources for the industry.



Licensing Framework for the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector. License requirement Section 32 of the NCC Act empowers the NCC to issue communication licenses for the operation and provision of communication services or facilities by way of class or individual license on such terms and conditions as the NCC may from time to time determine. No person can operate a telecommunications system or facility, or provide a communications service in Nigeria, unless authorized to do so under a communications license or exempted under regulations made by the NCC. The NCC also issues an ‘international sub-marine cable infrastructure landing station services license’, which allows the licensee to land, install, operate and manage submarine cable infrastructure in Nigeria. The license is typically for a period of 20 years or such other period as may be imposed by the regulator.





11







Technical Standards and Duties to End Customers. The NCC Act and guidelines issued pursuant to it prescribe technical standards to which Tingo Mobile’s partner Airtel Nigeria is required to adhere. Under Section 130 of the NCC Act, the NCC must publish technical codes and specifications for telecommunication equipment and facilities to be used in Nigeria. It is an offense to use any technical equipment or system which hinders network inter-operability, or which compromises public safety. The NCC must also conduct type approval tests and issue certificates in respect of communications equipment and facilities to be used in Nigeria. It is an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment to sell or install any communications equipment or facilities without first obtaining the NCC’s type approval test certificate. The NCC regularly publishes technical standards applicable to all telecommunications equipment to be used in Nigeria on its website, as well as lists of approved handsets and telecommunications equipment that have been tested and approved by the NCC for use in Nigeria.



Universal Service Obligations. The NCC Act empowers the NCC to design, manage and implement a universal service system that will promote widespread availability and usage of network services and application services throughout Nigeria. The NCC furthers this objective by encouraging the installation of network facilities and the provision of network services and applications to institutions in underserved areas and communities.



Federal Ministry of Communications. The Federal Ministry of Communications for Nigeria is responsible for policy formulation as it pertains to the information and communications technology sector. Its policy direction drives activities and developments within the sector. The Federal Ministry of Communications is mandated to facilitate universal, ubiquitous and cost-effective access to communications infrastructure and to utilize information and communications for job creation, economic growth and transparency in governance.



Anti-Money Laundering Act and Anti-Money Laundering Regulations. Section 1 of the Nigeria Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (the “MLA”) provides that no body corporate shall, except in a transaction concluded through a financial institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding ₦10 million (approximately $27 thousand USD). Section 2 of the MLA places a reporting obligation on any body corporate transferring funds or securities exceeding $10 thousand USD or its equivalent to or from a foreign country. The relevant body corporate is required to report in writing, within seven days of the transaction, to the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Nigerian SEC.



Data Protection Laws



The Consumer Code of Practice Regulations. The Consumer Code of Practice Regulations (2007) (the “CCP Regulations”) issued by the NCC regulates data protection in the telecommunications sector. The CCP Regulations obligate NCC licensees to take all steps reasonable to prevent the “inappropriate” and “inadvertent” disclosure of customers’ information. The CCP Regulations also prohibit the transfer of the information of customers to third parties except as consented to by the customers or as permitted or required by the NCC or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Licensees that collect customers’ information are required to adopt and implement a policy regarding the proper collection, use and protection of that information and ensure that other licensees to whom they disclose such information have adopted the consumer information policy.



The Nigeria Data Protection Regulations. The Nigeria Data Protection Regulations (2019) (the “NDPR”) safeguard the rights of natural persons to data privacy and prohibit the manipulation of personal data. The NDPR applies to all transactions intended for the processing of personal data and the actual processing of personal data, notwithstanding the means by which the data processing is conducted or intended to be conducted, and in respect of natural persons present in Nigeria and natural persons residing in Nigeria or residing outside Nigeria but of Nigerian descent (the “Data Subject”). The NDPR imposes a duty of care on anyone entrusted with or in possession (“Data Controller”) of any information relating to a Data Subject (including but not limited to names, photographs, bank details, posts on social networking sites, and IP addresses) (“Personal Data”). A Data Controller will be held accountable for acts and omissions in respect of data processing and in accordance with the principles of handling Personal Data in the NDPR which are: (a) collection and procession of Personal Data in line with the specific, legitimate and lawful purpose consented to by the Data Subject; (b) adequacy, accuracy and non-prejudice of Personal Data; (c) storage during a reasonable period of need; and (d) security against all foreseeable hazards and breaches including but not limited to cyber-attack, manipulations and damage by exposure to natural elements.





12







The consent of the Data Subject must be obtained by the Data Controller before processing the Personal Data of the Data Subject. In obtaining consent, the specific purpose of collection must be made known to the Data Subject. The Data Controller has an obligation to ensure that consent is not obtained by fraud, coercion or undue influence. Consent should also not be sought, given or accepted in any circumstance that will engender the direct or indirect propagation of criminal acts or antisocial conduct.



Legal Proceedings



In November 2017, the Nigeria Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (“EEFC”) brought a criminal charge (Case No. 6491C/2017) in the High Court of Lagos State, Nigeria, against Mr. Mmobuosi in connection with Tingo Mobile’s issuance of checks, amounting to approximately $72,000 in the aggregate, to three of Tingo Mobile’s suppliers. Payment on the checks was stopped due to a dispute with the suppliers over the delivery of services underlying the payments. These suppliers filed a petition with the EEFC who, in turn, filed the charge described above against Mr. Mmobuosi in his individual capacity as signatory for Tingo Mobile, as remitter of the checks.



The payment dispute between the suppliers, on the one hand, and Tingo Mobile, on the other hand, should have been resolved in a civil proceeding, particularly given that Tingo Mobile did have sufficient funds in its accounts to honor the checks, which would have been a prerequisite to defending a successful criminal charge. The suppliers, however, opted instead to file a petition with the EEFC against Tingo Mobile and Mr. Mmobuosi.



During the pendency of the charge, in April 2018, each of the suppliers entered into separate settlement agreements, dropping all charges against Tingo Mobile. Each of the suppliers also sent separate letters to the EEFC, informing the EEFC of their settlements and withdrawal of charges. Following the settlements and explanatory letters, the parties expected that the EEFC would, sua sponte, file a dismissal with the High Court.



As several years passed and the EEFC did not take action on its own to adjudicate or dismiss the charge, on June 28, 2022, counsel to Mr. Mmobuosi filed a Motion in the High Court of Lagos State in the Ikeja Judicial Division to dismiss the charges. The Motion has, thus far, been unopposed by the EEFC and any such opposition is not expected. We expect the matter to be dismissed later in 2023.



One or more members of the TGH Group is, from time to time, also involved in various de minimus legal proceedings before courts in the jurisdictions where we operate in the ordinary course of TGH’s business, and may also be subject to such proceedings in other countries. None of these proceedings is expected to have a material effect upon the TGH Group’s financial condition or results of operations.

Market Opportunity



China’s insurance brokerage market has experienced rapid growth due to increased demand for insurance products in the past few years. According to iResearch report, the total insurance premium in China is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2019 to 2024.  China is the second biggest insurance market in the world. 497 insurance broker companies, which sell insurance policies underwritten by insurance companies and design and develop insurance products themselves according to customer needs, and 1764 insurance agent companies, which are only licensed to only sell insurance policies underwritten by insurance, sold insurance products with an aggregate premium amount of 3.98 trillion RMB (approximately $0.62 trillion) in the year of 2020.



Although the size of China’s insurance market in terms of insurance premium was the second largest in the world according to the iResearch report, insurance penetration (defined as insurance premium over GDP) and insurance density (defined as insurance premium per capita) in China were still substantially lower than those in developed countries, indicating significant growth potentials. According to the 14th Five Year Plan formulated by the Chinese government, China’s insurance penetration and density are expected to reach 6.8% and RMB6,596 (approximately US$971), respectively, by 2025.





17







Driven by the significant medical protection gap and rising awareness for protection, the Chinese insurance market is expected to reach RMB7.8 trillion by 2024, representing a CAGR of 12.9% from 2019. Thanks to regulatory tailwinds, growth in household disposable income and increasing awareness for health protection, Chinese insurance market is expected to continue to maintain the strong growth momentum in the long term.



Local insurance companies in China only offer a limited range of insurance products, which cannot meet the needs of a 1.4 billion Chinese population, as compared to the product offerings by U.S. or European insurers in those countries with a smaller population.



Through its regulatory actions, the Chinese government encourages participation of foreign investors in insurance companies and related businesses. Under the PRC law, foreign investors are permitted to have up to 100% ownership in insurance companies. Furthermore, foreign joint venture companies may transact insurance business online and offline.

Stock Trading and Wealth Management Platform: Magpie Invest 



The Company launched Magpie Invest, a global stock trading app, on September 15, 2021, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Magpie Securities Limited (“Magpie”).



Magpie Invest is a proprietary technology investment trading platform. The Magpie Invest technology allows the platform to currently connect to seven major stock exchanges with the ability to connect to other major exchanges as the business need arises.




BI Intermediate (Hong Kong) Limited obtained an approval from the HKSFC on February 22, 2021 and successfully acquired Huapei Global Securities, Ltd. (“Huapei”), a licensed corporation in Hong Kong that is allowed to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 9 (assent management) regulated activities in Hong Kong, on February 26, 2021. Huapei subsequently changed its name to Magpie Securities Limited on May 27, 2021.



Magpie is a participant of the SEHK (Hong Kong Stock Exchange) & HKSCC (Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company) and the China Connect program, which allows for mutual market access between the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the mainland Chinese stock exchanges. Magpie is also the member of London Stock Exchange. 



Magpie has recently expanded into Singapore through its application for a Capital Markets Services License (“CMS License”) from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), which was approved in full on September 20, 2022. Magpie’s Singapore operations and trading are scheduled to commence by early second quarter of 2023. The CMS License allows Magpie to offer new products, including leveraged foreign exchange and contracts for difference (“CFDs”) on stocks, index futures and commodities.



Magpie currently employs more than 25 full-time employees and 10 contract staff and aims to expand into additional jurisdictions and geographical markets, both within Asia and other regions.



In response to significant changes in retail client behaviors in the trading of global equity markets, and driven by the rise in global interest rates and the end of COVID-19 restrictions in early 2022, Magpie pivoted its business strategy to a “B2B” Brokage-as-a-Service model. Magpie is currently progressing this strategy with major banks and financial services companies in various jurisdictions. However, the continued uncertainty in the global markets has posed challenges to Magpie’s pursuit of this strategy and the execution of contracts with such banks and financial services companies. 



The Platform for Securities Trading




Magpie believes it offers a unique user experience built upon a scalable and secure platform. The platform is currently designed to serve the emerging affluent Chinese and Southeast Asian population and diaspora, and targets generation Z and the millennial markets. Magpie is pursuing an opportunity to facilitate a shift in the wealth management industry and build a digital gateway into broader financial services. The platform is designed to provide a user experience that integrates clear and relevant market and company data, and easy to use trade execution.



Magpie aims to continue to enhance its proprietary technology and build a comprehensive, user-oriented and cloud-based platform that is fully licensed to conduct securities brokerage business on a global basis by expanding its license portfolio. Magpie Invest serves as one of the foundations from which the Company can execute its growth strategy of building a broader financial services platform.



Magpie provides investing services through a proprietary digital platform, which is accessible through any mobile device operating on iOS and Android, and more recently on other electronic devices via its web-based platform which was launched during the third quarter of 2022. The Magpie Invest platform and applications currently offer market data, news, research, analytical tools and provides customers with a data foundation to help simplify the investing decision-making process.



Market Opportunity



According to an iResearch Report published on January 15, 2020, the market size of the online brokerage industry focusing on global Chinese investors in terms of U.S. and Hong Kong stock trading volume experienced rapid growth over the preceding three years. This presents an attractive market opportunity for online brokerage service providers focused on the global Chinese investor market. Magpie believes that the technology, functionality and user experience of the Magpie Invest platform also creates the opportunity for it to target a larger investor market (not only the Chinese investor market) in other major territories throughout the world.



Revenues are currently generated primarily from stock trading commission income. Magpie also has the opportunity to generate income from other revenue streams such as interest from financing and foreign exchange. Magpie plans to add derivatives, leveraged foreign exchange, and CFDs on global indexes and commodities to the platform in 2023, following the approval of its CMS License from MAS in September 2022.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | obtain any and all licenses necessary for the operation and growth of Magpie’s business, and to maintain the validity of such licenses as applicable to the operation and growth of Magpie’s business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategy



Magpie intends to provide a high-quality and comprehensive investing experience by focusing on delivering convenience and stability to its own customers as well as to the customers of its white-label partners.



Magpie has designed every step of Magpie’s platform’s experience, from sourcing and researching ideas to trade execution, with a goal to create a simple and convenient experience. Magpie identifies certain hurdles that investors, particularly retail investors, face along their investing journey, and Magpie strives to mitigate inconvenience and information asymmetry through Magpie’s platform with the use of data and technology.





23







Magpie recognizes that investing is a meaningful component of Magpie’s customers’ broader wealth management. With this in mind, the Magpie Invest platform features the following:




● | an automated multi-level protection mechanism to ensure the services and functions delivers to users and clients are secure;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strict security policies and measures, including encryption technology and a two-factor authentication function, to protect proprietary data such as customers’ personal information and trading data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cloud technology which allows Magpie to process large amounts of data in-house, which should reduce the risks involved in data storage and transmission; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | backed up data across different servers at different locations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | electronic processing and execution of all orders and transactions, which is designed to minimize the risks associated with human error while maintaining the stability of the platform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Magpie provides customers with a comprehensive set of services throughout their investing experience. Core services include trade execution and margin financing. The trade execution process is entirely online and automated. Orders are delivered directly to respective exchanges.



As a result of the operational efficiencies afforded by Magpie’s technology, Magpie can offer very competitive brokerage commission rates for online trading as compared to many of the more traditional competitors. Magpie’s revenues from securities brokerage services includes brokerage commissions and platform service fees from customers, which are recognized on a trade-date basis when the relevant transactions are executed.



Margin Financing



Magpie offers margin financing to customers who trade securities listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the major stock exchanges in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Europe in a manner compliant with the guidelines and requirements of the HKSFC . This feature essentially allows customers to borrow against their own stock and cash holdings in order to buy additional securities on margin. All financing extended to its customers is secured by shares which has sufficient liquidity and low volatility as assessed by Magpie. The shares are automatically pledged in cross-market account assets so that the value in a customers’ multiple market trading account, which may include cash in different currencies and acceptable securities listed on the aforementioned markets, will be aggregated when calculating the value of the customers’ collateral. Magpie believes this will provide efficiencies as it will eliminate the costs and procedures involved in cross-market currency translation or exchange.



Magpie’s customers are eligible for margin financing services when they hold securities that are acceptable as pledges to us in their accounts. Magpie maintains a list of acceptable marginable securities on Magpie’s website (www.magpiesecurities.com). The credit line for each eligible customer is determined based on the securities across all of their trading accounts. The margin financing services for eligible margin financing customers are activated automatically when the funds in their accounts are not sufficient to purchase the desired securities and there is still sufficient balance in their credit lines.



Magpie has a list of securities acceptable as collateral to us and their respective margin ratios that is regularly updated and shared with customers. Magpie’s risk management team’s role is to determine the margin ratio for each of the acceptable securities based on the trading frequency, historical price fluctuations and general market volatility. Magpie will also reference the financing terms of major financial institutions in establishing margin ratios and intend for margin requirements to be equal or lower than the financial institutions. Magpie’s margin ratios are monitored in real-time and the risk management team review and adjust the margin ratios for each acceptable security on a quarterly basis and more frequently in the case of a significant and rapid price decline.

Impact of COVID-19 and Our Resources and Opportunities



The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupted business operations of many companies in Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. We have taken a series of measures in response to the outbreak to protect our staff, including, among others, combined office and remote working arrangements for our employees and travel restrictions or suspension. Our operations, including our services to our clients and internal control over financial reporting, have not been materially affected by these measures as we timely implemented our business continuity plan without any meaningful resource constraints.



Further, in view of the increased market volatility witnessed in the global capital markets and increased COVID-19 restrictions in Hong Kong until the recent policy relaxation, although people are spending more time at home, it has not led to an increased in new account sign-ups, or increasing trading velocity and higher net asset inflow.



This has increased competition and raised the cost of acquisition of customers and also lengthened the cost recovery period which we believe is not currently economical.



PRC Regulations Relating to Insurance Agencies, Insurance Brokers and Other Intermediaries



The insurance industry is heavily regulated in the PRC. The applicable laws and regulations governing insurance activities undertaken within the territories of the PRC consist principally of the PRC Insurance Law and rules and regulations promulgated under that law.
