ITEM 1     BUSINESS
Weyco Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "we," "our," "us" and the “Company”) engage in one line of business: the design and distribution of quality and innovative footwear. We design and market footwear principally for men, but also for women and children, under a portfolio of well-recognized brand names including: Florsheim, Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, BOGS, Rafters, and Forsake. Trademarks we maintain on our brands are important to our business. Our products consist primarily of mid-priced leather dress shoes, casual footwear composed of man-made materials and leather, and outdoor boots, shoes, and sandals. Our footwear is available in a broad range of sizes and widths, primarily designed to meet the needs and desires of the general American population.
On June 7, 2021, we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and certain liabilities of Forsake, Inc. Forsake joined BOGS as part of our outdoor division. Forsake designs and markets modern outdoor footwear, including hiking shoes and sneakerboots, under the brand name “Forsake.” Its products are sold primarily in outdoor specialty stores and on e-commerce websites throughout North America. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the acquisition.
We purchase finished shoes from outside suppliers, primarily located in China and India, and we have recently begun contracting with suppliers located in Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic as well. Almost all of these foreign-sourced purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. While we source from more than 60 suppliers, our two largest suppliers each accounted for more than 10% of our total inventory purchases in 2022. Costs from our suppliers have historically been relatively stable, although in recent years there have been upward cost pressures due to higher freight, labor, and material costs, as well as due to tariffs and other trade protection measures.
Our business is separated into two reportable segments – the North American wholesale segment (“Wholesale”) and the North American retail segment (“Retail”). We also have other wholesale and retail businesses overseas in Australia, South Africa, and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim Australia”). Our overseas businesses previously included wholesale and retail businesses in Europe (“Florsheim Europe”); however, we closed Florsheim Europe in 2021. As a result, the 2022 operating results of the “other” category reflect only Florsheim Australia.
Sales in our wholesale segment, which include both wholesale sales and worldwide licensing revenues, constituted 81% and 77% of total net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. At wholesale, our shoes are marketed by retailers throughout the United States and Canada in more than 10,000 shoe, clothing and department stores. In 2022 and 2021, no individual customer represented 10% or more of our total net sales. We employ traveling salespeople and independent sales representatives who sell our products to retail outlets. Shoes are shipped to these retailers primarily from our distribution center in Glendale, Wisconsin. In the men’s footwear business, there is generally no identifiable seasonality, although new styles are historically developed and shown twice each year, in spring and fall. With the BOGS brand, focused on winter and outdoor boots, there is seasonality due to the nature of the product; the majority of BOGS sales occur in the third and fourth quarters. Consistent with industry practices, we carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements and periodically provide extended payment terms to customers. We also have licensing agreements with third parties who sell our branded shoes outside of the United States, as well as licensing agreements with specialty shoe, apparel and accessory manufacturers in the United States. 
Sales in our retail segment constituted 10% and 12% of total net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The retail segment consists of e-commerce businesses and four brick and mortar stores in the United States. Retail sales are made directly to consumers on our websites, or by our employees. We believe that the results of our U.S. retail segment will continue to be driven by our e-commerce businesses, as we have only a limited number of brick-and-mortar stores. We intend to continue to focus on investing in and growing our e-commerce businesses. 
Sales of our other businesses constituted 9% and 11% of total net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, these sales came from our wholesale and retail operations at Florsheim Australia. In 2021, these sales came from our wholesale and retail operations at Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 643 persons worldwide, of whom 462 were full-time employees.
Brand recognition, price, quality, and service, are all important competitive factors in the shoe industry. We have a design department that continually reviews and updates product designs. Compliance with environmental and other government regulations historically has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations, although there can be no assurances as to the future.
