Business Strategy
The Company operates based upon the following core strategies, which the Company designed to enhance shareholder value by growing strategically while preserving asset quality, improving efficiency and increasing profitability:
Grow Organically. The Company focuses on continued organic growth through the Company’s existing footprint and business lines. The Company plans to follow a community-focused, relationship-driven customer strategy to increase loans and deposits through the Company’s existing locations. Preserving the safety and soundness of the Company’s loan portfolio is a fundamental element of the Company’s organic growth strategy. The Company has a strong and conservative credit culture, which allows the Company to maintain its asset quality as the Company grows. In addition, the Company has established an enterprise risk management function to identify and mitigate risk on a Company wide basis to support continued growth.

Grow Through Acquisitions. The Company plans to continue to take advantage of opportunities to acquire other banking franchises both within and outside the Company’s current footprint. Since mid-2010, the Company has completed eleven acquisitions that the Company believes have enhanced shareholder value and the Company’s market presence. The following table summarizes each of the eleven acquisitions completed since 2010.

Acquired Institution/Market | Date of Acquisition | Fair Value of Total Assets Acquired
 | | (dollars in thousands)

Integrity Bancshares, Inc.Houston, Texas | June 1, 2018 | 851,875 

The acquisition of Carlile Bancshares, Inc. (Carlile), and its wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar Bank (Northstar), represented the Company’s expansion in the Dallas/North Texas and Central Texas areas as well as its entry into the Fort Worth, Texas and Colorado Front Range markets. The Company acquired 42 new locations as part of the transaction. The assets acquired in this acquisition represented 82.2% of the Company’s asset growth in 2017.
The Integrity Bancshares, Inc. acquisition represented the Company’s continued expansion in the Houston metropolitan area. Through this acquisition, the Company added four locations in attractive sub markets in the Houston area and added approximately $852 million in assets. The assets acquired in this acquisition represented 73% of the Company’s asset growth in 2018.
Subsequent Acquisition of Guaranty Bancorp On January 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Guaranty Bancorp (Guaranty), and its subsidiary, Guaranty Bank and Trust Company (Guaranty Bank). As a result of the acquisition, the Company added 32 full service banking locations along the Colorado Front Range including locations throughout the Denver metropolitan area and along I-25 to Fort Collins, expanding the Company's footprint in Colorado. The Company's estimated fair value of assets acquired as of January 1, 2019 is approximately $3.9 billion.
Subsequent Alignment of Retail Footprint. On February 21, 2019, Independent Bank announced plans to rebalance its retail footprint by consolidating locations in Colorado and Texas. Independent Bank will consolidate eight branches in Colorado and four branches in Texas as part of this plan. As a result of the planned branch consolidation, Independent Bank will have a total of 93 banking locations, with 61 Texas locations and 32 Colorado locations. These changes will reduce overlapping locations and improve efficiency, while keeping Independent Bank well-positioned to support existing customers and future growth.
Future Opportunities. The Company plans to explore additional opportunities in the growing sub markets within the Company’s current market regions and attractive new markets in Texas such as San Antonio. Factors considered by the Company to evaluate expansion opportunities include (a) similar management and operating philosophy, (b) accretive to earnings and increase shareholder value, (c) ability to improve efficiency, (d) strategic expansion of Company footprint and (e) enhance market presence in existing markets. The Company has a scalable infrastructure and experienced acquisition team which it believes will enable the Company to successfully integrate acquired banks. The Company intends to remain disciplined in its approach to acquisitions using appropriate valuation metrics.
2

Improve Efficiency and Increase Profitability. The Company employs a systematic and calculated approach to increasing the Company’s profitability and improving the Company’s efficiencies. The Company continues to update its operating capabilities and create synergies within the Company in the areas of technology, data processing, finance, compliance and human resources. The Company believes that the Company’s scalable infrastructure provides the Company with an efficient operating platform from which to grow in the near term without incurring significant incremental noninterest expenses, which will enhance the Company’s returns.
Independent’s Community Banking Services
The Independent Way. Nearly a century after the Company’s beginning, the Company’s dedication to serving the needs of businesses and individuals in the Company’s communities remains stronger than ever. The Company strives to provide the Company’s customers with innovative financial products and services, local decision making and a level of service and responsiveness that is second to none. The Company’s innovative and independent spirit is balanced by adherence to fundamental banking principles that have enabled the Company to remain strong, sound and financially secure even during challenging economic times. The Company is also steeped in a tradition of civic pride as evidenced by the investment of the Company’s time, energies and financial resources in many local organizations to improve and benefit the Company’s communities.
Lending Operations. Through Independent Bank, the Company offers a broad range of commercial and retail lending products to businesses, professionals and individuals. Commercial lending products include owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, interim construction loans, commercial loans (such as SBA guaranteed loans, business term loans, equipment lease financing, lines of credit and energy related loans) to a diversified mix of small and midsized businesses, and loans to professionals, including medical practices. Retail lending products include residential first and second mortgage loans and consumer installment loans, such as loans to purchase cars, boats and other recreational vehicles.
The Company’s strategy is to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio by type and location. The Company’s loan portfolio consists of real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgage loans, residential construction loans, agricultural loans and consumer loans. Real estate secured loans are spread among a variety of types of borrowers, including owner occupied offices for small businesses, medical practices and offices, retail operations and multi-family properties. The Company’s loans are diversified geographically throughout the Company’s Dallas/North Texas region (approximately 49%), the Company’s Houston region (approximately 27%), the Company’s Austin/Central Texas region (approximately 18%) and the Company's Colorado Front Range region (approximately 6%). See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loan Portfolio” for a more detailed description of the Company’s lending operations.
Deposits. Deposits are the Company’s principal source of funds for use in lending and other general banking purposes. The Company provides a full range of deposit products and services, including a variety of checking and savings accounts, debit cards, online banking, mobile banking, eStatements and bank-by-mail and direct deposit services. The Company also offers business accounts and management services, including analyzed business checking, business savings, and treasury management services. The Company solicits deposits through its relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through community focused marketing. The Company also utilizes an experienced Treasury Management team to solicit and manage large deposit relationships.
Other Services. In connection with our relationship driven approach to our customers, the Company offers residential mortgages through our mortgage brokerage division. As a mortgage broker, the Company originates residential mortgages which are sold into the secondary market shortly after closing. The Company also supports residential mortgage operations through a mortgage warehouse program. The Company provides wealth management services to its customers through Private Capital Management, LLC, a registered investment advisory firm, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Independent Bank as part of the Guaranty acquisition.
Competition
The Company competes in the commercial banking industry solely through Independent Bank and firmly believes that Independent Bank’s long-standing presence in the community and personal service philosophy enhance the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers. This industry is highly competitive, and Independent Bank faces strong direct competition for deposits, loans and other financial-related services. The Company competes with other commercial banks, thrifts and credit unions. Although some of these competitors are situated locally, others have statewide or nationwide presence. In addition, the 
3

Company competes with large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and certain government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. The Company believes that its banking professionals, the range and quality of products that the Company offers, its market presence, and its emphasis on building long-lasting relationships distinguishes Independent Bank from its competitors.
According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, as of June 30, 2018, the Company had the 13th largest deposit market share in Texas and the 37th largest deposit market share in Colorado. With the acquisition of Guaranty, the Company's proforma market share is the 8th largest deposit market in Colorado. We believe that our strong market share is a reflection of the Company’s ability to compete with more prominent banking franchises in our markets.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed approximately 1087 persons. The Company provides extensive training to its employees in an effort to ensure that the Company’s customers receive superior customer service. None of the Company’s employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that the Company’s relations with the Company’s employees are good.

Supervision and Regulation
General. The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, the growth and earnings performance of the Company and its subsidiaries will be affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the OCC, the Texas Department of Banking, or TDB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies, and any changes to such statutes, regulations and policies, can be significant and cannot be predicted.
The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries establishes a comprehensive framework for their respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit 
4

insurance fund, the banks’ depositors and the public, rather than the Company’s shareholders or creditors. The description below summarizes certain elements of the applicable bank regulatory framework. This description is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, and the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are described herein.
The Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act has had a broad impact on the regulation and operation of financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the “source of strength” doctrine, authorized the CFPB and implemented new mortgage lending rules, established a risk retention rule, imposed limitations on trading activities, made permanent the deposit insurance limit of $250,000 and increased the minimum Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio, enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates, and expanded corporate governance requirements and executive compensation limitations for U.S. public companies. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act are incorporated in the discussion of supervision and regulation of the Company and Independent Bank below. 
Independent Bank Group as a Bank Holding Company
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, or the BHC Act, and to supervision, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve’s jurisdiction also extends to any company that the Company directly or indirectly controls, such as the Company’s nonbank subsidiaries.
Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends; Source of Strength. The Company is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from Independent Bank. The principal source of the Company’s revenues is dividends received from Independent Bank. As described in more detail below, Texas state law places limitations on the amount that state banks may pay in dividends, which Independent Bank must adhere to when paying dividends to the Company. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless (a) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (b) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and (c) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. Accordingly, the Company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income in any year or that can only be funded in ways that weaken its ability to serve as a source of financial strength for its banking subsidiaries, including by borrowing money to pay dividends.
Under Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies have historically been required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries, and the Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support Independent Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed below, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. If the capital of Independent Bank were to become impaired, the Federal Reserve could assess the Company for the deficiency. If the Company failed to pay the assessment within three months, the Federal Reserve could order the sale of the Company’s stock in Independent Bank to cover the deficiency.
Scope of Permissible Activities. Under the BHC Act, the Company is prohibited from acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or financial holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks, except that the Company may engage in, directly or indirectly, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain activities found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper. These activities include, among others, operating a mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing investment and financial advice; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing personal property on a full-payout, nonoperating basis; and providing certain stock brokerage and investment advisory services. In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.
5

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, effective March 11, 2000, or the GLB Act, amended the BHC Act and eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service providers. The GLB Act permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. The GLB Act defines “financial in nature” to include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve.
Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve’s capital regulations and Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a bank holding company to receive prior approval of and/or provide the Federal Reserve with prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. In certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as one million dollars ($1,000,000) for each day the activity continues.
Anti-Tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other nonbanking services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve has historically utilized a system based upon risk-based capital guidelines under a two-tier capital framework to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stockholders’ equity, retained earnings, a limited amount of qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain intangibles. Tier 2 capital generally consists of certain hybrid capital instruments and perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities and a limited amount of subordinated debt, qualifying preferred stock, loan loss allowance, and unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities. The regulatory capital requirements are applicable to the Company because its total consolidated assets equal more than $1 billion. Independent Bank is subject to the capital requirements of the FDIC.
Under the guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a “risk-weighted” asset base. Historically, the guidelines required a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.0% (of which at least 4.0% was required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements). Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Risk-weighted assets exclude intangible assets such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles.
In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. The leverage ratio is a company’s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets. In general, bank holding companies were required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%.
The federal banking agencies’ risk-based and leverage capital ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions must maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule implementing the revised capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly known as “Basel III,” as well as additional capital reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Act. This final rule, which became fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, requires bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity.
6

The new final capital framework, among other things, (i) introduces as a new capital measure “Common Equity Tier 1,” or CET1, (ii) specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to the prior regulations.
As now fully phased-in the new capital rule requires, among other things, a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio with a minimum required ratio of 4.5% of total assets and an increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 capital from the current level of 4% of total assets to 6% of total risk weighted assets and the continuation of the requirement to maintain total capital of 8% of total risk-weighted assets and a leverage ratio of 4%. 
The Company became subject to the new capital rules on January 1, 2015. A number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to the rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015 were subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. However, because of our asset size, we were eligible for the one-time option of permanently opting out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We elected this option. 
For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. The new regulations make certain changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure compared to the earlier capital rules. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.
In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios, the Company and Independent Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, and increased each year until the buffer requirement was fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
Under the FRB’s prompt corrective action standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, Independent Bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10%, and a leverage ratio of 5%; and must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. In order to be considered adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. As of December 31, 2018, Independent Bank was “well-capitalized.” An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits.
The Federal Reserve’s capital regulations and Regulation Y generally require a bank holding company to receive the prior approval of and/or provide the Federal Reserve with prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities.
Interchange Fees. The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act limits the amount of interchange fees that banks with assets of $10 billion or more may charge to process electronic debit transactions. An issuer must begin complying with the Durbin Amendment no later than July 1 of the next calendar year after the issuer crosses the $10 billion threshold. The Company and Independent Bank exceeded $10 billion in total consolidated assets upon consummation of the merger of the Company with Guaranty Bancorp and the merger of Independent Bank with Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, both on January 1, 2019. Thus, Independent Bank will become subject to the rule on July 1, 2020, Under the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulations, bank issuers who are not exempt may only receive an interchange fee from merchants that is reasonable and proportional to the cost of clearing the transaction.  The maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions.  A debit card issuer may also recover $0.01 per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve.  In addition, the Federal Reserve has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product.

Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. Bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels. In the event an institution becomes undercapitalized, it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.
The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized. The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve is required to consider, among other things, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the financial condition, managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA), the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the proposed acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. The Company’s ability to make future acquisitions will depend on its ability to obtain approval for such acquisitions from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve could deny the Company’s application based on the above criteria or other considerations. For example, the Company could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to the Company or, if acceptable, may reduce the benefit of a proposed acquisition.
Control Acquisitions. Federal and state laws, including the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, or the CBCA, impose additional prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. Whether an investor “controls” a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting securities. Subject to rebuttal, an investor is presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting securities and either the depository institution or company is a public company or no other person will hold a greater percentage of that class of voting securities after the acquisition. If an investor’s ownership of the Company’s voting securities were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to “control” the Company for regulatory purposes, which could subject such investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences.
Volcker Rule. Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the Volcker Rule, prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds.” Proprietary trading is, in general, trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity's own account.  In December 2013, the federal banking agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. After the enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018, Volcker Rule limitations apply to banking entities with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Under the Volcker Rule implementing regulations, banking entities have two years to conform its investments and implement the required compliance plan or in the case of the Company, January 1, 2021.
Federal Securities Laws. The common stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, the Company is subject to the reporting, information disclosure, proxy solicitation, insider trading limits and other requirements imposed on public companies by the SEC under the Exchange Act. This includes limits on sales of stock by certain insiders and the filing of insider ownership reports with the SEC. The SEC and Nasdaq have adopted regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd Frank Act that apply to the Company as a Nasdaq-traded, public company, which seek to improve corporate governance, provide enhanced penalties for financial reporting improprieties and improve the reliability of disclosures in SEC filings.

Regulation of Independent Bank
Independent Bank is a Texas-chartered banking association, the deposits of which are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC. Independent Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System; therefore, Independent Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the TDB. Such supervision and regulation subject Independent Bank to special restrictions, requirements, potential enforcement actions and periodic examination by the FDIC and the TDB. Because the Federal Reserve regulates the Company, the Federal Reserve also has supervisory authority that directly affects Independent Bank.
Equivalence to National Bank Powers. The Texas Constitution, as amended in 1986, provides that a Texas-chartered bank has the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in Texas. To the extent that the Texas laws and regulations may have allowed state-chartered banks to engage in a broader range of activities than national banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or the FDICIA, has operated to limit this authority. The FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as a principal in any activity not permitted for national banks, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC. In general, statutory restrictions on the activities of banks are aimed at protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions.
Financial Modernization. Under the GLB Act, a national bank may establish a financial subsidiary and engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting as principal, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development, real estate investment, annuity issuance and merchant banking activities. To do so, a bank must be well capitalized, well managed and have a Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, rating from the FDIC of satisfactory or better. Subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions. Such actions or restrictions could include divestiture of the “financial in nature” subsidiary or subsidiaries. In addition, a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a CRA rating of satisfactory of better.
Although the powers of state chartered banks are not specifically addressed in the GLB Act, Texas- chartered banks such as Independent Bank will have the same if not greater powers as national banks through the parity provisions contained in the Texas Constitution and other Texas statutes.
Branching. Texas law provides that a Texas-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Texas provided that the branch is approved in advance by the TDB. The branch must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The Dodd-Frank Act permits insured state banks to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Transactions between Independent Bank and its nonbanking subsidiaries and/or affiliates, including the Company, are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes limits on the amount of such transactions, and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries. Covered transactions with any single affiliate may not exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of Independent Bank, and covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed, in the aggregate, 20% of Independent Bank’s capital and surplus. For a bank, capital stock and surplus refers to the bank’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital guidelines, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses excluded from Tier 2 capital. Independent Bank’s transactions with all of its affiliates in the aggregate are limited to 20% of the foregoing capital. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, in connection with covered transactions that are extensions of credit, Independent Bank may be required to hold collateral to provide added security to Independent Bank, and the types of permissible collateral may be limited. The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates.
9

Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which generally requires that certain transactions between Independent Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to Independent Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons.
The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and in Regulation O promulgated by the Federal Reserve apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and bank holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. Generally, these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Loans to senior executive officers of a bank are even further restricted, generally limited to $100,000 per senior executive officer. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions.
Restrictions on Dividends. Dividends paid by Independent Bank have provided a substantial part of the Company’s operating funds, and for the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that dividends paid by Independent Bank to the Company will continue to be the Company’s principal source of operating funds. However, capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Independent Bank. Under federal law, Independent Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, it would be undercapitalized. The FDIC may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though Independent Bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after payment of the dividend.
Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the FDI Act, provides that, in the event of a “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If Independent Bank fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the Company, with respect to any extensions of credit it has made to Independent Bank.
Examinations. The FDIC periodically examines and evaluates state nonmember banks. Based on such an evaluation, the FDIC may revalue the assets of the institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the FDIC determined value and the book value of such assets. The TDB also conducts examinations of state banks, but may accept the results of a federal examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination. In addition, the FDIC and TDB may elect to conduct a joint examination.
Audit Reports. Insured institutions with total assets of $500 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared by independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the institution’s holding company can be used to satisfy this requirement. Auditors of an insured institution must receive examination reports, supervisory agreements and reports of enforcement actions. For institutions with total assets of $1 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, management’s certifications signed by the Company’s and Independent Bank’s chief executive officer and chief accounting or financial officer concerning management’s responsibility for the financial statements, and an attestation by the auditors regarding Independent Bank’s internal controls must also be submitted. For institutions with total assets of more than $3 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. The FDICIA requires that Independent Bank have an independent audit committee, consisting only of outside directors, or that the Company has an audit committee that is entirely independent. The committees of such institutions must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel, and must not include representatives of large customers.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. The FDIC has adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of insured institutions and may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk. The FDIC’s risk-based capital guidelines generally require state banks to have a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of 4.0% and a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. The capital categories have the same definitions for Independent Bank as for the Company. The FDIC’s leverage guidelines require state banks to maintain Tier 1 capital of no less than 4.0% of average total assets, except in the case of certain highly rated banks for which the requirement is 3.0% of average total assets. The TDB has issued a policy which generally requires state chartered banks to maintain a leverage ratio (defined in accordance with federal capital guidelines) of 5.0%.

Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies. The federal banking regulators are required by the FDI Act to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to capital-deficient institutions that are FDIC-insured. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A “well capitalized” bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher, and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized” bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or higher, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher (3.0% or higher if the bank was rated a composite 1 in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth), and does not meet the criteria for a well‑capitalized bank. A bank is “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized.
In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions, including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment.
As an institution’s capital decreases, the FDIC’s enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. The FDIC has only very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator.
Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital.
Deposit Insurance Assessments. Substantially all of the deposits of Independent Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC, and Independent Bank must pay annual deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance protection. The FDIC maintains the deposit insurance fund by designating a required reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio falls below the designated level, the FDIC must adopt a restoration plan that provides that the deposit insurance fund will return to an acceptable level generally within five years.
On December 20, 2010, the FDIC raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund to 2.00%, which exceeds the 1.35% reserve ratio that is required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC has the discretion to set the price for deposit insurance according to the risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio. 
The deposit insurance fund reserve ratio is maintained by assessing depository institutions and establishing an insurance premium based upon statutory factors. Under its current regulations, the FDIC imposes assessments for deposit insurance according to a depository institution’s ranking in one of four risk categories based upon supervisory and capital evaluations.
On February 7, 2012, the FDIC approved a final rule that amends its existing deposit insurance funds restoration plan and implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Effective as of July 1, 2012, the assessment base is determined using average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity rather than the current assessment base of adjusted domestic deposits. Because the change resulted in a much larger assessment base, the final rule also lowered the assessment rates in order to keep the total amount collected from financial institutions relatively unchanged from the amounts previously being collected. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate for Independent Bank could range from 2.5 to 45 basis points on an annualized basis.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, for institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank’s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. The FDIC deposit assessment will be required to use this new calculation starting in the second quarter of 2020, the fourth consecutive quarter in which the Company’s total consolidated assets are expected to exceed $10 billion.
11

Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits, without receiving a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on any deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking agencies have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.
Cross-Guarantee Provisions. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or the FIRREA, contains a “cross-guarantee” provision, which generally makes commonly controlled insured depository institutions liable to the FDIC for any losses incurred in connection with the failure of a commonly controlled depository institution.
Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire service area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of such banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The FIRREA requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application.
Consumer Laws and Regulations. In addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein, Independent Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Housing Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. Independent Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of their ongoing customer relations.
The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has broad authority to regulate and supervise retail financial services activities of banks, such as Independent Bank, and has the authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, guidance and policy statements, conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions with regard to consumer financial products and services. In general, banks with assets of more than $10 billion, such as Independent Bank, are to be examined for compliance with federal consumer protection laws by the CFPB. Starting in the second quarter of 2020, the fourth consecutive quarter in which the Company’s total consolidated assets are expected to exceed $10 billion, Independent Bank will be subject to CFPB jurisdiction. Until that time, the Company will continue to be examined for consumer compliance by the FDIC. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, there is uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s examination and regulatory authority might impact our business.
Privacy. In addition to expanding the activities in which banks and bank holding companies may engage, the GLB Act also imposed new requirements on financial institutions with respect to customer privacy. The GLB Act generally prohibits disclosure of customer information to nonaffiliated third parties unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, are required to comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the GLB Act.
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Legislation. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act, substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant 
12

new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued and, in some cases, proposed a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. The USA Patriot Act requires, among other things, financial institutions to comply with certain due diligence requirements in connection with correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons, establish an anti-money laundering program that includes employee training and an independent audit, follow minimum standards for identifying customers and maintaining records of the identification information and make regular comparisons of customers against agency lists of suspected terrorists, their organizations and money launderers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting certain countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to a U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Changes in Laws, Regulations or Policies
In general, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures. Such initiatives may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company and Independent Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that any potential legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations with respect thereto, would have, upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or Independent Bank. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or Independent Bank could have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Company and Independent Bank.
Enforcement Powers of Federal and State Banking Agencies
The federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the Company or Independent Bank and their subsidiaries, as well as their respective officers, directors, and other institution‑affiliated parties, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed above under “Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies,” the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist. The TDB also has broad enforcement powers over Independent Bank, including the power to impose orders, remove officers and directors, impose fines and appoint supervisors and conservators.
Effect on Economic Environment
The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.
13

Federal Reserve monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The Company cannot predict the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of it and its subsidiaries.
