ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are an early commercial-stage life sciences instrumentation and research services company engaged in the development of scientific assets and novel intellectual property across multiple “omics” fields. We leverage our expertise with True Single Molecule Sequencing (tSMS) technology enabling researchers and clinicians to contribute major advancements to scientific research and development by accelerating one’s understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and fundamental biological processes. We believe our proprietary sequencing technology platform has critical advantages over existing NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) technologies, particularly for emerging applications in the research and development of biomarker discovery, epigenetics, nucleotide chemistry, forensics, and cell-free nucleic acid analysis. Our mission is to empower researchers with improved genetic tools that enable scientists and physicians to better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease and the underlying biological systems. This knowledge is essential to the continued development of new breakthroughs in genomic medicine that address the critical concerns involved with today’s precision medicine.



Our single molecule technology enables researchers to identify and synthesize DNA or RNA strands, irrespective of abundance, in a biological sample and is capable of analyzing billions of molecules in parallel, which positions us as both competitive and complementary with other NGS platforms. We believe our technology advantage is a simplified method of quantifying DNA and RNA molecules at single molecule resolution because our platform does not require the routine PCR amplification and library preparation and ligation steps required by most NGS systems, thereby avoiding systematic bias and consequential additional costs. Our current sequencing platform offers advantages, such as the ability of certain samples to reveal previously unknown molecular profiles by directly detecting single molecules with little to no manipulation of the original sample. Our tSMS platform then generates data that is highly accurate and creates reproducible molecular profiles, often providing researchers with new insights into the biology being researched. As supported by multiple peer-reviewed research publications, our tSMS technology platform has assisted medical researchers in uncovering potentially significant DNA and RNA biomarkers for the early detection of diseases.



Our strategy is to integrate the tSMS platform with the development of novel applications across multiple market segments, and to generate revenue through sales of partnership-specific systems and related flow cells and reagents, which we refer to as “sequencing kits”, research services and research grants. We do not offer or sell any products that are founded upon or incorporate our tSMS platform directly to healthcare professionals or consumers. To strengthen our market position, we strive to build and control intellectual property around the instruments, sequencing kits and methods that enable these applications to strengthen our market position. Integral to this strategy will be to work with existing customers in developing new instruments optimized for specific assay and chemistry performance in order to support a wide array of applications. Our target customers are consumers of NGS products and services engaged in research activities and the development of new or improved products, such as academic and government institutions, hospitals and medical centers, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and non-profit research organizations.



Under our current operating model, we expect the revenue we generate from a specific customer to scale as our partnership or collaboration with such customer matures and the intellectual property founded on our tSMS platform is developed and sold by such customer. Initially, our customer-specific revenue is typically dependent on the funding of, or research grants obtained by, our partners and their ability to develop novel products. During the early stages of our partnerships or collaborations, we generally derive revenue from research services, grants, and the sale of customized instruments and sequencing kits as intellectual property is developed. Over the longer term, however, we expect to generate increasing revenues from our customers from the sale of application-specific assays or tests that are developed on our platform and for which we will receive royalties, a revenue split or other renumeration for the use of our platform or jointly-developed intellectual property.

Background on Genetic Sequencing



Genetic inheritance in living systems is conveyed through a naturally occurring information storage system known as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. DNA stores information in linear chains of chemical bases known as adenine (“A”), cytosine (“C”), guanine (“G”) and thymine (“T”). Inside living cells, these chains usually exist in pairs bound together in a double helix by complementary base pairs. A “genome” is an organism’s complete set of DNA, which for humans consists of approximately three billion DNA base pairs. Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is a molecule used by organisms to convey genetic information. A “transcriptome” is an organism’s complete set of RNA molecules at an active cellular state and includes both protein coding and noncoding RNA transcripts.



Genetic sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases (A, C, G, or T) in a sample. This consists of three phases: sample preparation, physical sequencing and analysis. Generally, the first step of sample preparation is either to shear the target genome into multiple small fragments or, depending on the amount of sample DNA or RNA available, amplify the target region using a variety of molecular methods. In the physical sequencing phase, the individual bases in each fragment are identified in order, creating individual sequence reads. The number of individual bases identified contiguously is defined as “read length.” The sequencing throughput is generally defined as the product of the number of individual sequence reads and the average read length of the sequence reads. In the analysis phase, bioinformatics software is used to align overlapping reads, which allows the original genome to be assembled into contiguous sequence.



Studying genomes and transcriptomes helps scientists understand the inheritance of biological characteristics, developmental biology and normal and disease states of cells and organisms. Genetic variation accounts for many of the differences between individuals, such as eye color and blood group, and also affects a person’s susceptibility to certain diseases such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Genetic variation can also determine a person’s response to drug therapies.



A trend in healthcare is towards ‘personalized medicine’ to enable more accurate diagnosis and treatment through better understanding of each individual patient’s disease. We believe that a greater understanding of the genome will lead to this new healthcare paradigm where diseases are understood at the molecular level, allowing patients to be diagnosed according to genetic information, in many instances earlier and more accurately, and be treated with drugs designed to work on specific molecular targets. The goal is to offer precision-personalized medicine that will identify disease earlier, reduce healthcare costs, and enable more appropriate and effective treatment for better outcomes and quality of life. To date, this has largely been done through genomic testing, which provides information about a patient’s predisposition to disease or likely response to medication, due to each individual’s unique constellation of genes. However, DNA testing is, in most cases, a static readout that does not change through a patient’s lifetime or disease course. It does not provide information about the patient’s current health status. An increasing number of researchers, however, now believe the transcriptome provides dynamic information about the current state of the body that can be used to assess health, to detect early signs of disease and to enable physicians to select the appropriate treatment, monitor response to treatment and detect unwanted side effects.



Cell-free Nucleic Acids as Disease Biomarkers:   Most of the DNA and RNA in the body are inside the cells, but a small amount of nucleic acids is also found in biological fluids such as blood, saliva and urine. This material is generally referred to as cell-free DNA (“cfDNA”) and cell-free RNA (“cfRNA”). Analysis of these free-floating molecules can lead to multiple applications such as early disease detection, drug selection and treatment monitoring. For example, large amounts of cell-free DNA material might indicate a bacterial infection or sepsis in very early stages. Cell-free DNA is typically derived from chromatin as intact nucleosomes, or histone-bound DNA, which can be analyzed in addition to solely assessing DNA. Another such example is cfRNA analysis for detection, diagnosis and monitoring of malignant diseases such as cancer. The cfRNA transcripts are differentially expressed between normal and cancerous tissues. These transcripts can be used as a reliable biomarker for cancer screening and diagnostic applications. Analysis of cfRNA can be used to measure dynamic changes in the gene expression, allow oncologists to evaluate disease status, predict outcomes from anti-tumoral therapies and monitor the disease after treatment.



Sequencing Technologies: There are different sequencing technologies available for sequencing genetic material, each producing the sequence data in a unique format. Some of the technologies produce millions of sequence reads with a very short-read length, generally less than 300 nucleotide bases. These technologies are generally referred as short-read NGS platforms. Other technologies produce several thousand sequence reads of a very long-read length, generally more than 1,000 nucleotide bases. These technologies are generally referred as long-read NGS platforms. Both, the short- as well as long-read NGS technologies have their advantages in various settings. For de novo assembly of genomes and long RNA transcripts, the long contiguous reads from the long-read NGS technologies are preferred. Generally, short-reads can be used to further fill in gaps in the data from longer read technologies. For molecular counting application, a large number of independent reads from short-read NGS technologies are preferred. RNA quantitation typically occurs after converting extracted RNA molecules into cDNA fragments using commercially available reverse transcriptase as part of that process. This approach, within which there are a variety of methods, is loosely defined as RNA sequencing or “RNA-Seq”. Different genes are present in varying amounts in biological samples, and the success of the technique is highly dependent on the dynamic range of the detection technology.

Limitations of Existing Technologies



There are multiple short-read and long-read NGS technologies available in the market that partially address the need for accurate and sensitive analysis of genetic information. These technologies can further be classified based on the resolution of the technology as single-molecule sequencing technology and amplification-based technologies. Most single-molecule sequencing technologies do not require amplification, though many of the long-read technologies still require complex sample manipulation prior to sequencing. This is especially true for sequencing of RNA molecules. Over the past two decades, researchers and clinicians have used these technologies to gain a deeper understanding of nucleic acids, to study biomarkers associated with disease, to identify molecules for new drug discovery, to create novel applications for early screening and diagnosis, and more recently to create genome-editing techniques. While researchers are making progress on various fronts by utilizing a combination of these technologies, there remains a wide gap between the needs of the research community and the capabilities of existing sequencing tools. This gap is hindering the advancement of scientific research. The inherent limitations of current technologies are summarized below:

● | Biased results: Short-read NGS technology typically requires a large number of DNA molecules during the sequencing process. To generate enough DNA molecules, an amplification step is required during sample preparation. This amplification process can introduce errors known as amplification bias. The effect of this bias is that resulting copies are not uniformly representative of the original template DNA, causing skewed data representation in the final results. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





3








● | Lower sensitivity: In cases where the original template DNA contains regions of relatively high G-C content or relatively high A-T content, the amplification process tends to under-represent these regions. As a result, these regions, which may contain entire genes, can be completely missed. The non-linear nature of the amplification thus limits its ability to detect subtle changes in the genetic signature. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inefficient library preparation: Many of our competitors use systems requiring multi-step sample preparation protocols to prepare sample libraries before sequencing. This library preparation technique is inefficient, capturing only a fraction of the informative input material. The process selectively captures the molecules that are present in large quantities while losing lower frequency molecules, thus not producing a true representation of the input material. The library preparation protocol limits the minimal amount of input sample. The library preparation steps also add significant burden on the sample preparation. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inadequate throughput: Applications such as transcriptome profiling, gene expression and biomarker discovery require accurate quantification of data. The long-read single molecule technologies fall short due to the smaller number of strand throughput required to substantiate the presence or absence of a biomarker in a specific sample. The short-read amplification technology is limited due to a skewed data representation caused by the non-linear amplification bias present in the workflow. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology Solution



Our tSMS platform offers a single molecule solution for DNA and RNA sequencing by performing detection of nucleic acids without the need for complex sample manipulation. Researchers using our platform can analyze many billions of single molecules in a single experiment and still generate highly accurate and reproducible data. We believe our technology’s critical advantage over other technologies is because our platform does not require the routine library preparation steps, such as PCR amplification and ligation, necessary for use with most NGS systems, thereby avoiding systematic amplification bias. RNA sequencing on our platform detects transcripts regardless of abundance and with high accuracy in quantifying gene expression changes associated with certain disease as well as detecting subtle changes in RNA transcript levels that are undetectable with other methods.



Our single molecule platform is unique because it combines a proprietary fluorescence-based optical detection apparatus with a precision microfluidics and thermal control system to perform sequencing-by-synthesis, as illustrated in Figure 1 below.







Figure 1. tSMS Technology Workflow



Our platform typically derives sequencing information directly from the sample itself, not a copy of the sample. It does not require amplification at any stage of the process and offers simple, straightforward sample preparation protocols. The technology uses a single-stranded DNA and RNA material with lengths that range from less than 20 bases to more than 1000 bases as an input. The platform then captures the material on a glass surface and uses a patented fluorescence-based optical detection apparatus combined with a precision microfluidics system to perform a sequencing-by-synthesis reaction on the input sample.



The single molecule fluorescence signal from millions of individual strands is captured by images using a high-sensitivity camera during multiple cycles of nucleotide incorporation. Our powerful image analysis system processes these images to produce the sequence data as an output. The output data contains millions of individual unique sequences with the average read length of between 35–60 nucleotide bases, with a range of 20–100 nucleotide bases. This length is sufficient to allow unambiguous identification of the origin of each sequence.



Our system still requires isolation and preparation of DNA or RNA samples; however, our system is adaptable to most purification and preparation kits and techniques that are currently available in the market and no additional or special steps are required to prepare the samples for sequencing.

The single molecule resolution of the sequence data in association with a sub-100 nucleotide base read length positions our platform as the only short-read single molecule sequencer commercially available in the market. The amplification-based short-read technologies are already helping the scientists in the fields of research, diagnostics and therapeutics. By giving the short-read technology the power of single molecule resolution, we believe our tSMS technology offers critical advantages over existing technologies, including:




● | Minimal Sample Preparation. Our tSMS platform offers a simple sample preparation process. The DNA strands are cut in shorter sizes, converted into single strands, and then tagged with a universal surface capture primer. By avoiding the complex multi-step library preparation method, the sample integrity is preserved, and the bias and errors in the sequence data output exhibited by other methods are avoided. The simplicity of our sample preparation workflow and its effect on the output data variance, compared to NGS data produced by an Illumina system, is illustrated in Figure 2 below. [van den Oever et. al. (Clinical Chemistry, April 2012)].
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








Figure 2. tSMS vs Amplification-based Technologies Workflow




● | Greater Sensitivity. Our tSMS platform offers a high level of sensitivity as each strand is identified and synthesized irrespective of its abundance in the sample. In the existing amplification-based technologies, low expressing transcripts are typically masked due to preferences and may be missed or have their numbers minimized in the final data analysis. The simplified sample preparation along with single molecule resolution facilitates the unbiased, proportionate representation of input sample, even of the low expressing transcripts and constructs. This allows for obtaining more accurate information earlier (for potential clinical treatments or decisions to be made sooner). Figure 3 below illustrates that the tSMS platform identified low-expression transcripts missed by the standard PCR-based methodology when using Illumina. The lowest expressed quartile of transcripts was detected with our tSMS technology at a 7.10x rate compared to a leading NGS platform [Sam LT, Lipson D, Raz T, et al. A Comparison of Single Molecule and Amplification Based Sequencing of Cancer Transcriptomes. PLoS One. 2011].

● | High Accuracy. Our tSMS platform provides an accurate set of data and results as well as a broader range of molecules to be evaluated. The ability to count each individual molecule, combined with simplified sample preparation and greater sample sensitivity, yields an accurate quantitative representation of sample in the final data. Our technology has been demonstrated to produce robust accurate short-reads for a variety of applications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Seamless Flexibility. Our tSMS platform provides flexibility in two main aspects — throughput and applications. The tSMS platform has the ability to scale the throughput across a range of small to large projects. The programmable instrument workflow and modular design of sequencing kits provide flexibility to choose the sample coverage and read length required for the final data. The simplified sample preparation allows for analysis of any genetic material that can be attached to a glass surface.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Gene Sequencing Methodology



The patented tSMS technology is the essence of our tSMS platform. The gene sequencing methodology takes genetic material as input and produces sequence data as an output through sequentially processing the following five major steps.

1. | Sample preparation: A double helix strand is cut into fragments of 100–200 nucleotides in length. In the case of cfDNA and cfRNA material, this step is not necessary as cell-free strands are generally short and fit the profile of the input material. The strand fragments are then denatured to a single strand, and a poly-A universal priming sequence is added to one end of each strand as shown in the following figure.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Sample loading: The strands are hybridized in a flow cell with billions of universal Oligo T capture sites mobilized on the flow cell surface. The tSMS method typically utilizes a dT50 primer to initiate sequencing from a 3’ poly-A tail, although other capture primers may be used to increase the specificity of sample hybridization. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Template registration: Once hybridized, a “Fill & Lock” step fills up the rest of the open bases from the poly-A tail followed by the addition of fluorescently labelled nucleotides to the start of the strand. A laser illuminates the flow cell and the camera records the location of each captured sample strand. The flow cell is moved in sequential steps to allow the camera to cover its entire active area. The dye molecules are then cleaved and washed away. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. | tSMS sequencing-by-synthesis:
---+------------------------------


a. | Synthesis: DNA polymerase enzyme and the first of the four types of novel fluorescently labelled nucleotides are added. If the nucleotide is complementary to the next base in the template strand, the polymerase will add it to the primer strand. The nucleotides are designed to inhibit the polymerase from incorporating more than one base at a time on the same strand. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | Wash: Excess polymerase and unincorporated nucleotides are then washed away. This step ensures that only the incorporated nucleotides are available for fluorescence imaging. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | Image: The narrow bandwidth laser illuminates the flow cell surface to excite the fluorescently labelled nucleotides. The camera records the locations where fluorescently labelled nucleotides were added. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d. | Cleave: The fluorescent dye molecules are then cleaved from the labelled nucleotides and washed away. This step ensures that these molecules are fluoresced only for that particular nucleotide addition cycle. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The process is repeated with each of the four types of labelled nucleotides until a desired sequence length is reached. As an example, repeating this cycle 120 times adds an average of more than 33 nucleotides to the primer strand. In sequencing, this is known as the “read length.”




5. | Data processing: The image analysis computer analyzes the series of images from each cycle and determines the sequence of bases in the template strand. The sequence is “read” by correlating the position of a fluorescent molecule in its vertical track with the knowledge of which base was added at that cycle. The sequence data is packaged in standard sequencing data formats for further bioinformatics analysis. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our True Single Molecule Sequencer (tSMS)







Described above is our gene sequencing methodology using our tSMS single molecule sequencing platform. It combines a simplified operation with powerful capabilities to directly sequence original samples of RNA and DNA consisting of major components:

1. | Sequencing Kit: The flow cells and reagents are the major components of a sequencing kit that the instrument needs at the start of every new run. The custom flow cell features 25 discrete flow channels, and each channel of the flow cell has millions of capture probes deposited on the cover glass. The sequencing samples are loaded into the flow cell channels using the sample loader. The sequencing run can sequence up to two flow cells in a single run. The reagent kit for the sequencing run consists of custom pre-packaged bottles that store proprietary tSMS chemistry reagents and wash buffers for the system. All of the flow cells and reagent kits are barcoded, so the sequencer can scan and store the barcodes as a part of the experiment setup procedure. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. | Sample Loader: The sample loader facilitates loading the billions of tailed single strands onto the glass surface of the standard 25 channel flow cell. A temperature-controlled chamber improves the hybridization efficiency and houses a mechanism to hold a standard flow cell used in the system. The proprietary sample loading block design helps to keep the transfer volume to near zero microliter, while the system offers precision control of loading the sample in 25 discrete channels without any cross-contamination. The input material volume for the sample loader can be as little as 20 microliters. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | tSMS Sequencer: The sequencer accepts up to two flow cells for a sequencing run, allowing sequencing of up to 50 individual samples in a single run. The benchtop sequencer is a fully-automated device that combines a Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy technique with a high-precision, temperature-controlled microfluidics system. The microfluidics system houses the reagent kit required to perform tSMS chemistry, and uses high-precision pumps and valves to formulate the chemistry just-in-time for delivery to the flow cell chamber during each chemistry cycle. The two-flow cell design maximizes the machine utilization by performing the chemistry cycle on one flow cell while the other flow cell is going through the imaging cycle, and vice-a versa. The flow cells are mounted on a high-speed, high-accuracy multi-axis stage that moves the flow cell along the channel with nanometer grade precision. The high-power optics system consists of a narrow bandwidth laser to provide the excitation signal, while the high-fidelity imaging system uses a highly sensitive camera for capturing the single molecule signal emitted by the fluorophores. All of these subsystem operations are integrated and controlled by an on-board computer in a completely automated fashion over the course of the run. A simple touch screen based graphical user interface walks the user through an intuitive run setup. A typical run on the sequencer captures three to six million images containing information about billions of individual single molecules in the strands. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Image Analysis Engine: The image analysis engine processes the images captured by the sequencer camera, aligns them with the template image at individual position, and creates the sequence data file to be used for further bioinformatics analysis. It features a high-power CPU array with large storage capacity hard drives specifically designed for intensive image analysis and storage purposes. The image analysis engine runs parallel to the camera, processing the images as soon as the camera starts imaging the flow cell. The image analysis engine software monitors the instrument status and automatically uploads the sequence data at the end of the run at a user-configurable network location. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The instrument has a web-based interface for remote monitoring that updates the key sequencing metrics and the instrument status in real time. The database system of the instrument stores the detailed logs for both record keeping and troubleshooting purposes.

Introduction of new technologies and products, while positive to the overall development of these markets, may result in greater competition for the limited financial resources available. There are a number of emerging markets for sequencing-based technologies that represent significant potential opportunities for us, such as but not limited to:




● | Life sciences research and development: NGS technologies are accelerating the discovery and development of more effective new drugs. The complex nature of biological pathways, disease mechanisms and multiple drug targets requires an accurate, unbiased, and sensitive molecular counting platform. Single molecule sequencing, with its unparalleled quantitative accuracy in large-scale expression profiling could enable high-throughput screening of promising drug leads. During clinical trials, our technology could potentially be used for companion diagnostics to generate individual genetic profiles that can provide valuable information on likely response to therapy, toxicology or risk of adverse events. The tSMS platform may also enable more precise selection of patient pools and individualization of therapy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Liquid biopsy: Liquid biopsy is emerging as a simple and non-invasive alternative to the traditional tissue biopsy approach for disease screening and monitoring. A simple draw of blood contains millions of tiny fragments of cell-free DNA/RNA material with lengths on the order of 100–200bp, which carry informative signatures of cancer and other life-threatening diseases even in a very early stage of the disease progression. With its quantitative accuracy, simple sample preparation methodology, and its ability to accurately sequence fragmented short molecules, our single molecule sequencing offers an excellent solution for liquid biopsy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Infectious disease: Infectious diseases are disorders caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi. These organisms contain DNA and RNA that act as infectious agents to transmit disease from person to person, by insect or animal, or through food and environmental means. The detection and sequencing of the DNA and RNA from pathogens provides medically actionable information for diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of infections. Accurate sequence information could also help to predict drug resistance. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical diagnostics: Our amplification and ligation free sequencing method allows us to identify subtle changes in the RNA transcript levels that are undetectable with other methods presumably due to bias and loss of low-level transcripts inherent to the other technologies. The power of our tSMS technology can help to address the large unmet need for biomarker discovery to diagnose diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer at very early stages. The potential of our technology for bio-marker discovery is illustrated in Figure 4 below, where tSMS RNA-seq was utilized to identify RNA-based gene expression changes associated with ADHD [McCaffrey TA, St Laurent G 3rd, Shtokalo D, et al. Biomarker Discovery in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: RNA Sequencing of Whole Blood in Discordant Twin and Case-controlled Cohorts. BMC Med Genomics. 2020]. Further studies offer the opportunity for validating future diagnostics applications.

● | Microbiome analysis: Microbial communities in and on the body show uniform bacterial diversity in healthy individuals. Drugs and diet can disrupt the microbial diversity, and thereby can affect disease progression and treatment efficacy. Our technology can accurately quantify the gene signature for all bacteria present and capture a real-time snapshot of the microbiome. This data can be used by physicians for disease treatment by applying methods to encourage growth of beneficial microbes and eliminate harmful microbes. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These examples of emerging markets for sequencing-based technologies represent significant potential opportunities for us. The development of these markets is subject to variability driven by ongoing changes in the competitive landscape, evolving regulatory requirements, government funding of research and development activities, and macroeconomic conditions. Given the ability of the tSMS platform to sequence nucleic acid fragments as well as to detect post-translational modifications within larger chromatin molecules, we believe our technology is uniquely positioned to produce data from molecules at both ends of the single molecule nucleic acid spectrum. This concept, and the technology leaders for each single molecule market segment, is illustrated in Figure 5 below, with our potential applications highlighted in blue font.

Our strategy is to integrate our tSMS platform with the development of novel applications across multiple market segments, and to generate revenue through partnership-specific systems and sequencing kit sales, research services and research grants. We strive to build and control intellectual property around the instruments, sequencing kits and methods that enable these applications to strengthen our market position. Integral to this strategy will be to work with existing customers in developing new instruments optimized for specific assay and chemistry performance in order to support a wide array of applications. Figure 6 below summarizes three priority areas of research and development for current and potential collaborations.







Figure 6. Three Priority Areas of Research and Development



Our target customers are consumers of NGS products and services engaged in research activities and the development of new or improved products, such as academic and government institutions, hospitals and medical centers, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and non-profit research organizations.



We have generated only nominal revenues to date from our current operating model and we do not expect our revenues to scale significantly until one or more of our customers or third-party partners or collaborators has developed application-specific assays or tests for which our platform serves as a foundation. Over the longer term, we expect to generate revenues from our customers, partners and collaborators through a combination of product sales, research services and research grants. We plan to expand these revenues from recurring and prospective clients by the following key strategies:




● | Provide the scientific community with a combination of research services and instrumentation to serve markets that we believe are inadequately addressed by existing technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assist in the development of new classes of RNA-based diagnostics tests.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Collaborate with researchers to enhance pharmacogenomics and biomarker discovery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support drug developers seeking a better understanding of the side effects of their new drugs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to innovate and develop new aspects of our products and technology, applications and instrumentation through scientific collaborations, including grants.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Customers and Collaborators



Our customer base is focused on academic research, biomarker discovery, and molecular diagnostic product development. These customers over the years have produced scientific achievements through collaborative research efforts. The majority of our current customers are early adopters of genomics technology including tSMS. A significant portion of the funding for these developing technologies has historically come from research grants provided by government agencies and non-profit research centers. We often collaborate with customers to drive innovation in the field of genomic sciences through grant funded research activities. Our key collaborators and our current activities are highlighted below:



U.S. Department of Justice’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)



In February, we announced the establishment of a two-year Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the FBI. Under this CRADA, SeqLL and the FBI Laboratory Division (FBI LD) will seek to evaluate and determine the forensic capabilities of direct RNA sequencing using our tSMS platform. The FBI LD and SeqLL will collaborate with a goal of producing an assay for forensic body fluid identification, without compromising traditional STR or DNA sequence analysis. This agreement is among the first times the FBI is utilizing the CRADA mechanism to further develop laboratory capabilities. CRADAs enable the sharing of resources and expertise for collaborative research that advances the FBI mission. Body fluid identification can provide investigative context and have probative value.



The Bernstein Laboratory



We have worked closely with the lab of Bradley Bernstein, M.D., Ph.D., Chair of Cancer Biology at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School to address fundamental questions in chromatin biology and epigenetic regulation. Dr. Bernstein is also the founder and Director of the Broad Institute Epigenomics Program. Scientists from the Broad Institute have used antibody-based detection coupled with tSMS to begin decoding a dual-marking system in modified histones that signals for a gene to be activated or repressed. Early results, published in Science, suggest differentiated cells exhibit different patterns of “bivalent” markings than embryonic cells. Our collaboration encompasses technology development, single-cell RNA and DNA analysis, and the creation of novel intellectual property. In addition to completing NIH grant funded research activities, we have provided Dr. Bernstein with tSMS systems and onsite support. In 2021, we published a single-cell RNA focused technology development manuscript in the Peer-reviewed journal, Cell Report.
The Ting Laboratory



We have been a long-time research collaborator with David Ting, M.D., Assistant Professor, Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a leading member at the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center in using tSMS to better understand cancer. His research is focused on the role of non-coding RNA transcription in cancer as it relates to tumorigenesis and as novel biomarkers. In this research area, the Ting Laboratory was first to discover aberrant overexpression of pericentromeric RNA repeats by RNA-seq using tSMS, which were found to play a significant role in pancreatic cancer and other epithelial cancers [Bersani, PNAS, December 2015]. This discovery resulted in new intellectual property related to pancreatic cancer biomarkers and the subsequent founding of Rome Therapeutics, an early-stage company focused on unlocking the repeatome to discover powerful new classes of medicines for cancer and autoimmune diseases. We have provided Dr. Ting with tSMS systems and onsite support, research services, and access to sample preparation methodologies.
The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine



Led by Chia-Lin Wei, Ph.D. with The Jackson Laboratory (“JAX”) and supported by a recent four-year, $2.3 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, we are assisting in the development of new methods for chromatin interaction analysis in single nuclei, with single-molecule resolution. JAX has stated that preliminary results indicate that, once fully developed, the methods under development have the potential to exceed previous methodologies and to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional (“3D”) genome biology. Our research grant efforts, including instrument prototype and sequencing kit development, are continuing and will focus on generating genome-wide, single-molecule chromatin interaction maps in a variety of biological systems and uncovering the structural detail of multiplex chromatin loci that are currently unresolvable given standard NGS. We developed a prototype system in the second half of 2021 and utilized this system for sample testing and data generation in 2022.
Weizmann Institute of Science



In partnership with the laboratory of Efrat Shema, Ph.D., we have recently developed and applied innovative single-molecule technologies to gain a deeper understanding of chromatin regulation. We are working to establish robust single-molecule systems for genome-wide profiling of combinatorial chromatin and DNA modifications, as well as development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic tools. We published multiple manuscripts in 2022, including “H3-K27M-mutant nucleosomes interact with MLLI to shape the glioma epigenetic landscape” in Cell Reports and “Multiplexed, single-molecule, epigenetic analysis of plasma-isolated nucleosomes for cancer diagnostics” in “Nature Biotechnology. We have provided the Weizmann Institute with access to prototype sequencing systems, sequencing kits, and sample preparation methodologies.

True Bearing Diagnostics, Inc.



We have participated in a research collaboration with Timothy McCaffrey, Ph.D. of The George Washington University’s Center of Genomic Medicine and True Bearing Diagnostics, Inc, performing tSMS on whole-blood RNA to identify transcripts associated with coronary artery disease (“CAD”). In comparison to other platforms that include NGS technologies, only our tSMS platform could consistently identify the novel mRNA signature in CAD patients. We believe this collaboration will provide the blueprint for a diagnostic test that could significantly reduce the more than one million U.S. catheterizations that are performed annually at a cost of approximately $20 billion per year. A scientific manuscript detailing biomarker discovery efforts for CAD was published in a 2021 peer reviewed journal. We have provided True Bearing Diagnostics with research services and access to sample preparation methodologies. Potential future work includes the development of a CAD-focused clinical system for regulatory clearance.
Tetracore, Inc.



Tetracore, Inc. focuses on antibody-based and nucleic acid-based detection reagents and technologies, and contracts with the U.S. Government for the development of real-time PCR diagnostic tests for biological warfare threat agents, novel nucleic acid extraction procedures, and specialized nucleic acid products. We have provided Tetracore with tSMS systems and onsite support. We are actively preparing applications for submission to the NIH, DARPA and other funding agencies regarding the use of our technology in the development and production of detection tools. These potential products, including non-NGS applications, are for clinical, animal health, and domestic preparedness testing.
Future Products



We expect to partner or collaborate with biotech and pharma companies to develop a clinical-grade tSMS sequencer for use with one or more diagnostic tests. We intend for our partners to commercialize diagnostic tests for applications for which the tSMS platform offers accurate diagnostic capability, such as non-invasive prenatal testing for early pregnancy and high-body-mass-index-mothers, liquid biopsy for oncology applications, microbiome analysis, and transcriptome-based diagnostics for cardiovascular disease, infectious disease and others. We will look to increase industry visibility and expand our reach globally for both sequencing services and instrument sales through strategic customer relationships and partnerships with larger organizations that can increase global support, supply and distribution. Through those partnerships, we plan to identify new, high-value, cutting-edge applications that are uniquely enabled by our amplification-free, direct DNA and RNA sequencing technology.



The accuracy, sensitivity and simplicity of the tSMS platform allows the technology to be applied for developing assays and instruments used for quality control of manufactured therapeutic products, including gene therapy and vaccine technologies. We plan to explore commercial-stage partnerships with therapeutics companies interested in accessing our tSMS platform.



As our partners or collaborators expand their product lines to address the diagnosis of disease, regulation by governmental authorities in the United States will become an increasingly significant factor in development, testing, production and marketing. Products developed for the diagnostics market, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as in vitro diagnostics by the FDA. Each medical device to be distributed commercially in the United States will likely require either 510(k) clearance or approval of a pre-market approval application (PMA) from the FDA prior to marketing the device for in-vitro diagnostic use. Clinical trials related to regulatory submissions may take years to complete and represent a significant expense. The 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months, but can take longer. The PMA pathway is more costly, lengthy and uncertain, and can take from one to three years, or longer.



We have not sought FDA approval of our sequencers because to-date we have marketed them for research purposes and not for clinical diagnostics. Through our partners or collaborators, we will likely need to assist in pursuing regulatory approvals from the FDA when they attempt to enter the diagnostics market, which is expensive, involves a high degree of risk and there is no assurance that we will be able to develop a commercially viable product. Even if the products under development are authorized and approved by the FDA, our partners or collaborators must still meet the challenges of successful marketing, distribution and customer acceptance.

Marketing, Sales, Service and Support



Our business model is focused on offering our customers and collaborators access to our tSMS technology in order to drive comprehensive and reliable solutions that enhance acceptance, customer loyalty and confidence, revenue growth and shareholder value. We plan to focus on addressing specific markets for which there are not currently adequate solutions. This will require education and demonstration of added value by helping customers and collaborators meet program timelines, providing data that supports their programs, and implementing custom solutions to meet each customer’s specific objectives. We currently generate revenue by selling to existing customers and through collaborative, research-focused efforts that create additional sales and growth opportunities.



To achieve recurring growth for our research services revenues and drive new value creation, we are implementing the following initiatives to increase market awareness of the tSMS platform:




● | Defining our value proposition in terms of commercial value and solution to customer needs, as related to platform flexibility, speed to solution, and comprehensive quality of the genetic information provided.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creating new literature that highlights our technology, instruments and capabilities. This includes brochures, white papers, application notes, case studies, and solution’s value proposition marketing material.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementing new customer facing programs including trade show participation, posters and presentations to showcase the solutions for commercial needs, and attending scientific conferences that publish the research data from the tSMS platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding visibility in segment verticals with segment organization participation and by creating integrated training and education programs as a part of instrument sales and the training process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Furthering research collaborations with key opinion leaders to address critical, high potential needs and publish the findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe this approach maximizes value to our customers and shareholders by supporting the largest possible number of customers.



Manufacturing



We have the capability to manufacture the required sequencing kits and instrumentation at our own manufacturing facility. We believe manufacturing all system components internally results in greater trade secret protection for our proprietary formulations and mechanics, a higher degree of customer satisfaction in our research business, and lower production costs. In the future, we may outsource some of the non-proprietary reagents and basic instrumentation sub-assemblies for parallel inventory production ramp-ups. Relationships to various contract manufacturing organizations have already been established and we believe several are prepared to provide these services once production demand exceeds internal capacity.



Our current manufacturing staff is comprised of a team of engineers and technicians each having more than 10 years of experience with the tSMS product line. The manufacturing team has deep experience with the tSMS platform and has the ability to adapt to future needs on both the hardware and sequencing kits. In addition, this group has experience in FDA product clearance and working in an FDA regulated environment. The team has been involved in manufacturing commercially available tSMS instruments since its original design and subsequent production in 2008.



We are planning to establish a controlled manufacturing process and environment, and to implement standards according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 5S lean manufacturing methodology, and other lean techniques. We also plan to create work cells for efficiency and material control for both sequencing kits and instrumentation. Implementation of quality assurance in manufacturing documentation and processes is one of our top priorities as we continue the path toward releasing a clinical grade tSMS sequencer that is compatible with the FDA clearance process.



We believe our current facilities are adequate and we have additional room to expand to meet our manufacturing needs for the foreseeable future.

Research and Development



Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining our advantage in single molecule sequencing. These efforts leverage our team’s involvement and continuing development of the tSMS technology for over a decade. The tSMS technology blends a number of scientific disciplines, including optics, micro-fluidics, biochemistry and molecular biology, systems engineering, and bioinformatics. Over the years, we have continuously established strong relationships with technology leaders and leading academic centers that augment and complement our internal research and development efforts.



Some of our research and development accomplishments include:




● | Production of a second generation tSMS sequencer in benchtop form-factor;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimized sample preparation, flow cell and reagent tSMS processes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovated machine-learning methods-based image analysis algorithms;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Co-authored multiple publications in scientific journals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Received multiple National Institutes of Health grant awards for technology development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We plan to continue our investment in research and development to enhance the performance and expand the application base of our current products, and to introduce additional products based on our technology. In addition, our engineering team will continue their focus on increasing instrument component and system reliability, reducing costs, and implementing additional system flexibility and versatility through the enhancement of existing products and development of new products.



Competition



Given the market opportunity, there are a significant number of competing companies offering gene sequencing equipment or sequencing kits. These include Illumina, Inc., Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Singular Genomics System, Inc., Element Biosciences, Inc., Ultima Genomics, Inc., and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Ltd. We believe we are uniquely positioned among the competition to be the only company offering high strand throughput with the power of single molecule resolution.



Our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and/or other resources than we do. These companies also have larger and more established manufacturing capabilities and marketing, sales and support functions. We expect the competition to intensify within this market. The increased competition may result in pricing pressures, which could harm our sales, profitability or market share. In order for us to successfully compete against these companies, we will need to demonstrate that our products deliver superior performance and value. We will also need to continually improve the breadth and depth of current and future products and applications.



Intellectual Property



Developing and maintaining a strong intellectual property position is an important element of our business. We maintain the intellectual property through a combination of licenses, patent protection and trade secrets.




16







We have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection for our technology, for improvements to our technology, as well as for any of our other technologies for which we believe such protection will be advantageous. In 2013, as part of the Helicos bankruptcy proceedings, we entered into the following non-exclusive license agreements:



License Agreement with Helicos Biosciences Corporation. Our tSMS technology has been in development since 2004 at Helicos Biosciences Corporation (“Helicos”), which pioneered the first generation tSMS technology resulting in its commercialization as the HeliScope Genetic Analysis System. In 2013, Daniel Jones, a former scientist at Helicos and our current Chief Executive Officer, formed our company to further the development of tSMS. We then purchased much of our physical assets from Helicos, including, among other items, sequencers, laboratory equipment, internal servers, protocols and data analysis procedures, through Helicos’ bankruptcy proceedings that began in 2012.



In 2013, we entered into, and since such date fully paid for, a non-exclusive, royalty-free license from Helicos, for the life of such patents, for over 60 patents, all but eight of which have since expired or been abandoned, covering key areas of our technology, including design, methods and chemistry. As part of the Helicos bankruptcy proceedings, Fluidigm Corporation, a U.S. public company engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of biological research equipment based on integrated fluid circuit technology, obtained the rights to this patent portfolio. The license grants to us the right to use or sell throughout the world products or processes based upon the intellectual property covered by the licensed patents in the field of contract gene sequencing, and prohibits us from sublicensing the intellectual property to any third party or to make any assignment of the license. The license may be terminated by Fluidigm in the event we sub-license or assign any of the intellectual to a third party; however, we have the right to use the patented technology in connection with any partnership or collaboration in which we have at least a 50% ownership interest. In addition, Fluidigm has a right to terminate the license in the event Daniel Jones, our Chief Executive Officer, fails to continue to work full time for us or if we fail to use reasonable care in the investigation, testing or solicitation of government approvals with respect to the intellectual property. In addition, the license will automatically terminate in the event we dissolve, cease to conduct business, file a petition for bankruptcy, assign all of our assets to a receiver or trustee or in the event we have an involuntary bankruptcy petition initiated against us that is not dismissed within 60 days. This license is provided to us on an “as is” basis only and without any representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the intellectual property and the use thereof. In addition, Fluidigm has no obligation under the license agreement to prosecute any patent application or to maintain any rights to the intellectual property by payment of any fees to any governmental agency. While the remaining patents comprising this patent portfolio are expected to expire in 2025 through 2028, as this patent portfolio has been broadly licensed, we do not expect such expirations to have a material adverse effect upon our business operations.



Sub-License Agreement with Helicos Biosciences Corporation. As part of the Helicos bankruptcy proceeding, Arizona Science and Technology Enterprises LLC (“AzTE”) agreed that Helicos could sub-license to us the license agreement between Helicos and AzTE with respect to 10 patents owned by AzTE for the life of such patents. All of the patents under this sublicense have since expired.



We have two pending patent applications, one filed in 2021 and the other filed in 2022. We received a Notice of Allowance regarding our previous patent application 15/754.222. In October 2022, the USPTO notified us that the related patent term adjustment was 779 days. Our issued and pending patents cover various aspects of our sequencing technology, and we expect to continue to file new patent applications to protect the improvements to our technologies.



We have registered our corporate name (SeqLL) and design logo, as well as the phrase “tSMS” and “DRS”. We protect trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes, preserving trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and acquiring licenses for technology or products.
