Item 1. Business
INTRODUCTION
Company Overview 
United Insurance Holdings Corp. (referred to in this Form 10-K as we, our, us, the Company or UPC Insurance) is a holding company primarily engaged in the residential personal and commercial property and casualty insurance business in the United States. Our largest insurance subsidiary is United Property & Casualty Insurance Company (UPC), and we also write business through American Coastal Insurance Company (ACIC), Family Security Insurance Company (FSIC), Interboro Insurance Company (IIC), and Journey Insurance Company (JIC). Our insurance subsidiaries provide personal residential and commercial property and casualty insurance products that protect our policyholders against losses due to damages to structures and their contents. Some of our insurance subsidiaries sell policies that protect against liability for accidents as well as property damage. Our non-insurance subsidiaries support our insurance and investment operations. 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 41.2 % of our policies in-force were written in Florida. We also write in Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Texas. We are licensed to write, but have not commenced writing business, in Alabama, Delaware, Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Virginia. A fundamental part of our strategy is to diversify our operations outside of Florida and to write in multiple states where the perceived threat of natural catastrophe has caused large national insurance carriers to reduce their concentration of policies. We believe an opportunity exists for UPC Insurance to write profitable business in such areas. 
We manage our risk of catastrophic loss primarily through sophisticated underwriting procedures and pricing algorithms, avoidance of policy concentration, and the use of a comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program. UPC Insurance has been operating continuously since 1999, and has successfully managed its business through various hurricanes, tropical storms, and other weather-related events. We believe our record of successful risk management and experience in writing business in catastrophe-exposed areas provides us with a competitive advantage as we grow our business in other states facing similar perceived threats.
On April 3, 2017, the Company acquired AmCo Holding Company (AmCo) and its subsidiaries through a series of mergers that ultimately resulted in the Company issuing 20,956,355 shares of its common stock as merger consideration to the equity holders of RDX Holding, LLC, the former parent company of AmCo. 
On August 30, 2018, the Company, in strategic partnership with RJ Kiln & Co. (No. 3 Limited) (Kiln), a subsidiary of Tokio Marine Kiln Group Limited, formed JIC. The Company owns 66.7% of JIC, while Kiln owns 33.3%.
Financial strength or stability ratings are important to insurance companies in establishing their competitive position and may impact an insurance company’s ability to write policies. We are rated by Demotech, AM Best, and Kroll Bond Rating Agency (Kroll). Demotech maintains a letter-scale financial stability rating system ranging from A’’ (A double prime) to L (licensed by insurance regulatory authorities). AM Best maintains a letter-scale financial strength rating system ranging from A++ (Superior) to S (suspended). Kroll maintains a letter-scale financial strength rating system for insurance companies ranging from AAA (extremely strong operations and no risk) to R (operating under regulatory supervision). The financial strength or stability ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 are listed below. With these ratings, we expect our property insurance policies will be acceptable to the secondary mortgage marketplace and mortgage lenders. 

Subsidiary | Demotech Rating | AM Best | Kroll Rating
UPC | A | | A- 
ACIC | A’ | | A- 
FSIC | A | | A-

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.

As of December 31, 2018, we had 293 employees. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We believe we have good working relationships with our employees. 
Our Strategy

Our vision is to be the premier provider of property insurance in catastrophe exposed areas. Historically, we have advanced our vision through strong organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions. Going forward, we plan to continue to diversify our exposure both by product and by geography. 
Our emphasis on growing in areas with an ongoing threat of natural catastrophes exposes our company to risk and volatility. We manage the inherent volatility associated with our risk profile in three primary ways: strategically, financially and operationally. 
Strategic Risk Management

UPC Insurance uses a strategic approach to manage inherent volatility through geographic and product diversification. In 2018, we continued to grow our premium base in our existing states. Our gross written premiums increased by 20% in 2018 compared to 2017. This is primarily a reflection of organic growth in new and renewal business generated in all regions. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our product offerings into states where we can leverage existing distribution capabilities. Primary factors considered in the evaluation of a potential new state include weather-related catastrophe history, the legal climate, and the competitive state of the market. Refer to “Geographic Markets” below for further information on our geographic distribution. 
Financial Risk Management
We take a financial approach to manage risk using robust reinsurance programs, low financial leverage and a conservative investment approach. UPC Insurance has several reinsurance programs in place including quota share, catastrophe excess-of-loss, and aggregate catastrophe. During 2018, our excess-of-loss reinsurance program covered all four of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries, gaining synergies in reinsurance costs and increasing our coverage limits for the June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019 program year. Refer to Note 9 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our reinsurance program. 
We also limit our financial leverage. In December 2017, the Company issued $150,000,000 of senior notes, the proceeds of which we have used to support our growth initiatives, such as forming JIC. We have a debt covenant in place which requires us to maintain a financial leverage of less than 30%, and we believe that this is a conservative limit to our leverage. As of December 31, 2018, our financial leverage was 23%. Refer to Note 11 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our debt offerings.
We follow a conservative investment approach using two outside investment management companies. Each manager has the authority and discretion to manage our investments, subject to the investment guidelines established by the Investment Committee of our Board of Directors and the direction of management. Our portfolio is primarily invested in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $951,836,000 at December 31, 2018, compared to $854,531,000 at December 31, 2017 with approximately 87.2% of our fixed maturities invested in U.S. Treasuries, or corporate bonds rated “A” or better. Refer to Note 3 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information on our investment policies. 
Operational Risk Management
Finally, we use an operational approach to manage risk by in-sourcing key insurance functions and establishing strong external distribution partnerships. During 2018, we continued to focus on the development of our internal claims department function. In 2017, we created a robust “UPC University” training program for our incoming claims adjusters, focused on providing world class service to our policyholders. In addition, we have leveraged our investments in internally developed claims and policy administration systems and analytics to manage exposure growth and improve profitability. 
In addition, we have taken two initiatives to monitor our risk management strategy related to loss activity. We have a five-person actuarial department whose primary focus is to manage risk for our company. Also, at the end of 2017, we formed a new entity, Skyway Reinsurance Services, LLC to insource our reinsurance intermediary function as part of our risk management strategy.

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.


We have also leveraged our current partnerships and added new strategic external partnerships to expand distribution and service capabilities in all states in which we operate. Refer to “Products and Distribution” below for further details on our external partnerships. 
PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION 
In 2017 and 2018, we continued to diversify our product mix, including through our merger with AmCo, which resulted in an increase in our commercial products from 3% of our product mix at December 31, 2016 to 28% of our product mix at December 31, 2018.
Personal Residential Products
Policies we issue under our homeowners’ program provide structure, content and liability coverage for standard single-family homeowners, renters and condominium unit owners. Personal residential products are offered in all states in which we write business.
In 2018, personal residential property policies (by which we mean both standard homeowners’, dwelling fire, renters and condo owners’ policies) produced written premium of $871,307,000 and accounted for 70% of our total gross written premium. Approximately 54% of the personal residential gross written premium was written outside of Florida. 
We have developed a unique and proprietary homeowners’ product. This product uses a granular approach to pricing for catastrophe perils. Our objective is to create specific geographic areas such that within each area or “catastrophe band” the expected losses are within a specified range of error or approximation from a central estimate. These areas may have millions 
 6

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.

of data points that help us create distance-to-coast factors that provide a sophisticated market segmentation that is highly correlated to our risk exposure and reinsurance costs. 
Loss and loss adjustment expenses related to our personal residential products tend to be higher during periods of severe or inclement weather, which varies from state to state. 
Commercial Residential Products
We provide commercial multi-peril property insurance for residential condominium associations in Florida. We include coverage to policyholders for loss or damage to buildings, inventory or equipment caused by covered cause of loss such as fire, wind, hail, water, theft and vandalism. 
In 2018, commercial policies produced written premium of $362,000,000 and accounted for 28% of our total gross written premium. 
Not-At-Risk Offerings
On our flood, equipment breakdown and identity theft policies, we earn a commission while retaining no risk of loss, since all such risk is ceded to the federal government via the National Flood Insurance Program (flood risk) and other private companies (other risks). We offer flood policies in all states in which we write business. Flood policies produced written premium of $19,207,000 and accounted for 2% of our total gross written premium at December 31, 2018. 

Underwriting
We price our product at levels that we project will generate an acceptable underwriting profit. We aim to be granular in our approach, so that our price can accurately reflect the risk and profitability of each potential customer. In our proprietary pricing algorithm, we consider insurance credit scores (where allowable) and historical attritional loss costs for the rating territory in which the customer resides, as well as projected reinsurance costs based on the specific geographic and structural characteristics of the home. In addition to the specific characteristics of the policy being priced, we also evaluate the reinsurance costs of each incremental policy on our portfolio as a whole. In this regard, we seek to optimize our portfolio by diversifying our geographic exposure in order to limit our probable maximum loss, total insured value and average annual loss. As part of this optimization process, we use the output from third-party modeling software to analyze our risk exposures, including wind exposures, by zip code or street address. 
We have established underwriting guidelines designed to provide a uniform approach to our risk selection and designed to achieve acceptable underwriting profitability. Our underwriters review the property inspection report during their risk evaluation and, if the policy does not meet our underwriting criteria, we have the right to cancel the policy within 90 days in Florida and within 60 days in all other states in which we operate. 
We measure our underwriting profitability by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses to either gross or net earned premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this report for further details on our combined ratio. 
Distribution Channels
 As of December 31, 2018, we market and distribute our policies to consumers through approximately 9,000 independent agents representing over 6,300 agencies, with only one agency, Allstate, representing more than 10% of our revenue. UPC Insurance has focused on the independent agency distribution channel since its inception, and we believe independent agents and agencies build relationships in their communities that can lead to profitable business and policyholder satisfaction. We believe we have built significant credibility and loyalty with the independent agent communities in the states in which we operate through (i) our extensive training for full-service insurance agencies that distribute our products, (ii) periodic business reviews using established benchmarks and goals for premium volume and profitability, and (iii) regular visits from the Company’s executives to strengthen the personal relationships with our agents and agencies. Also, each state is assigned a sales representative from UPC Insurance who lives in the community, recruits new agents and agencies, and provides direct support for existing agents and agencies. 
Typically, a full-service agency is small to medium in size and represents several insurance companies for both personal and commercial product lines. We depend on our independent agents to produce new business for us. We compensate our 
 7

UNITED INSURANCE HOLDINGS CORP.

independent agents primarily with fixed-rate commissions that we believe are consistent with those generally prevailing in the market. In 2018, we expanded our commission program in order to allow agents and brokers to be eligible to earn a bonus commission based on the overall profitability of policies they place with UPC Insurance in a particular year. 
In addition to our relationships with individual agencies, we have important partnerships with other insurance companies and industry associations. The largest of these relationships are with Allstate and GEICO. In Florida, Allstate’s Ivantage program refers Allstate auto insurance customers to our company and other partner companies to provide homeowners’ insurance. We partner with GEICO to underwrite homeowners’ policies for some of their auto customers. We also have a partnership with the Florida Association of Insurance Agents (FAIA) to serve as a conduit between UPC Insurance and many smaller insurance agencies in Florida with whom we do not have direct relationships.

* The information displayed in the table above is compiled and published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as of December 31, 2018 based on information filings submitted annually by all licensed insurance companies. The information above is presented on a consolidated or aggregated basis for each insurance company group. The amounts shown in the table above are also on a statutory basis and exclude non-Homeowners lines of business that are included in the Company’s total direct written premium for 2018.
We compete primarily on the basis of product features, the strength of our distribution network, the quality of our services to our agents and policyholders, and our long-term financial stability. Our long and successful track record writing homeowners’ insurance in catastrophe-exposed areas has enabled us to develop sophisticated pricing techniques that endeavor to accurately reflect the risk of loss while allowing us to be competitive in our target markets. This pricing segmentation approach allows us to offer products in areas that have a high demand for property insurance yet are under-served by the national carriers. However, we face the risk that policyholders may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us.

REGULATION
We are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled and licensed to transact business, primarily at the state level. UPC, ACIC, and JIC are domiciled in Florida, FSIC is domiciled in Hawaii, and IIC is domiciled in New York. UPC Insurance is also regulated by the NAIC. In general, these regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders. 
Such regulations have a substantial effect on certain areas of our business, including:
•insurer solvency,
•reserve adequacy,
•insurance company licensing and examination,
•agent and adjuster licensing, 
•rate setting, 
•investments, 
•assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds, 
•transactions with affiliates, 
•the payment of dividends, 
•reinsurance,
•protection of personal information, 
•risk solvency assessment and enterprise risk management,
•cyber security,
•statutory accounting methods, and

• | numerous requirements relating to other areas of insurance operations, including policy forms, underwriting standards and claims practices.

Our insurance subsidiaries provide audited statutory financial statements to the various insurance regulatory authorities. With regard to periodic examinations of an insurance company’s affairs, insurance regulatory authorities, in general, defer to the insurance regulatory authority in the state in which an insurer is domiciled; however, insurance regulatory authorities from any state in which we operate may conduct examinations at their discretion. In 2018, the Hawaii Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs finished performing a regularly scheduled statutory examination of FSIC for the five years ended December 31, 2016. There were no significant findings resulting from this examination.
For a discussion of statutory financial information and regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
Risk-Based Capital Requirements
To enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the NAIC has published risk-based capital (RBC) guidelines for insurance companies designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection statutory surplus provides for policyholders. The guidelines measure three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk; and (iii) other business risks. Most states, including Florida, Hawaii and New York, have enacted the NAIC guidelines as statutory requirements, and insurers having less statutory surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. 
The level of required risk-based capital is calculated and reported annually.  The table below outlines each of our subsidiary’s RBC ratios, all of which were in excess of minimum requirements, as of December 31, 2018.

Subsidiary | RBC Ratio
UPC | 301 | %
ACIC | 580 | %
FSIC | 306 | %
IIC | 1,109 | %
JIC | 20,345 | %

Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions
During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations: (i) created “market assistance plans” under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverage; (ii) restrict the ability of insurers to reject insurance coverage applications, to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term, and to terminate agents; (iii) restrict certain policy non-renewals and require advance notice on certain policy non-renewals; and (iv) limit rate increases or decrease rates permitted to be charged. 
Most states also have insurance laws requiring that rate schedules and other information be filed with the insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The insurance regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. 
Most states require licensure or insurance regulatory authority approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company’s business plan, solvency, reinsurance, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company, such as the character of its officers and directors. The insurance regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval.
Limitations on Dividends by Insurance Subsidiaries
As a holding company with no significant business operations of our own, we rely on payments from our insurance subsidiaries as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and meet our obligations. Our insurance affiliates are regulated as property and casualty insurance companies and their ability to pay dividends is restricted by Florida, Hawaii and New York law. 
The state laws of Florida, Hawaii, and New York permit an insurer to pay dividends or make distributions out of that part of statutory surplus derived from net operating profit and net realized capital gains or adjusted net investment income. The state laws further provide calculations to determine the amount of dividends or distributions that can be made without the prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities and the amount of dividends or distributions that would require prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities in those states. Statutory risk-based capital requirements may further restrict our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make distributions if the amount of the intended dividend or distribution would cause statutory surplus to fall below minimum risk-based capital requirements.
For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 and Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
As a holding company of insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in Florida, Hawaii and New York. These laws, among other things: (i) require us to file periodic information with the insurance regulatory authority, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations; (ii) regulate certain transactions between our affiliates and us, including the amount of dividends and other distributions and the terms of surplus notes: and (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. Any purchaser of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock could be presumed to have acquired control of us unless the insurance regulatory authority, upon application, determines otherwise.
Insurance holding company regulations also govern the amount any affiliate of the holding company may charge our insurance affiliates for services (i.e., management fees and commissions). We have a long-term management agreement among our managing company, United Insurance Management L.C., UPC and FSIC which presently provides for monthly management fees. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation and the Hawaii Insurance Division must approve any changes to this agreement. 
AmRisc, a managing general underwriter, handles the underwriting, claims processing and premium collection for AmCo and JIC, for monthly management fees. 
The Company does not utilize a managing general agent structure in New York. Instead, UPC Insurance allocates a portion of relevant expenses to IIC for statutory accounting purposes at cost.
