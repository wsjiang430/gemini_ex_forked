In this report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company”, “BioPharma”, “we”, “us” and “our” are to Nexien BioPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly Intiva BioPharma Inc.
 
Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated on November 10, 1952 in Michigan as Gantos, Inc. On July 21, 2008, the Company completed its change in domicile to Delaware and subsequently changed its name to Kinder Holding Corp. Since bankruptcy liquidation in June 2000, the Company has not had any operations and adopted “fresh-start” accounting as of June 21, 2000 in accordance with procedures specified by AICPA Statement of Position No. 90-7, “Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code.”
 
As of October 13, 2017, the Company completed a reverse acquisition (the “Share Exchange Transaction”) of Intiva BioPharma Inc., a private Colorado corporation (“Colorado BioPharma”). In connection with the completion of the reverse merger the Company changed its name to Intiva BioPharma Inc. on November 8, 2017.
 
Colorado BioPharma was formed under the laws of the State of Colorado in March 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kanativa USA Inc. (formerly Intiva USA Inc.) engaged in the business of developing drugs containing cannabinoids for the treatment of various diseases, disorders and medical conditions; the development or licensing of proprietary delivery systems for cannabinoid-based1 pharmaceutical medications; and the investment in companies and the acquisition of technologies or medications, focused on cannabinoid-based science through special purpose vehicles, discussed more fully below. Kanativa USA Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kanativa Inc., formerly Intiva Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation.
 
The Company changed its name to Nexien BioPharma, Inc. in September 2018.
 
On October 26, 2018, we entered into a Limited Liability Company Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the members of CRx Bio Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“CRx”), to acquire all of the membership interest in CRx in exchange for 11,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock (the “Acquisition”). CRx is engaged in the research and development of advanced cannabinoid formulations and drug delivery systems with a focus on bioavailability and related pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) optimization. The Acquisition transaction was consummated on October 26, 2018. By acquiring CRx as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we acquired all of its assets, which consist primarily of three U.S. provisional patent applications relating to cannabinoid formulations to treat convulsive disorders, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and neuropathic pain. At the closing, we issued to the six members of CRx (the “Sellers”) 1,100,000 shares not subject to any forfeiture restrictions and 9,900,000 shares which shall be released from forfeiture restrictions according to the following vesting schedule:
 

● | 30% shall be fully vested 12 months following the Closing (October 26, 2019); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 30% shall be fully vested 24 months following the Closing (October 26, 2020); and 
● | 30% shall be fully vested 36 months following the Closing (October 26, 2021). 

 
Any Seller who is not then providing services to us or any of our subsidiaries on any vesting date, whether through voluntary termination or termination “for cause,” will forfeit his unvested shares, which will be cancelled.
 

1 A cannabinoid is one of a class of diverse chemical compounds that acts on cannabinoid receptors in cells that alter neurotransmitter release in the brain. Ligands for these receptor proteins include the endocannabinoids (produced naturally in the body by animals), the phytocannabinoids (found in cannabis and some other plants), and synthetic cannabinoids (manufactured artificially). The most notable cannabinoid is the phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis. Cannabidiol (CBD) is another major constituent of the plant. There are at least 113 different cannabinoids isolated from cannabis, exhibiting varied effects.

Effective December 31, 2018, one of the sellers resigned from the Company and forfeited 1,732,500 unvested shares previously issued. In May 2019, that seller returned to the Company an additional 142,500 vested shares issued in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. The fair value of the returned shares was credited to the operations as of June 30, 2019.
 
Immediately after closing, Alex Wasyl, the CEO of CRx, was elected to serve as a director and our CEO. Alain Bankier, who had been serving as our interim CEO, was elected to serve as our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Strategy Officer. Richard Greenberg resigned his position as Chairman of the Board, but continues to serve on the Board. As of April 1, 2019, Mr. Bankier resigned as an officer and director of the Company.
 
Business Plan
 
The Company’s business objective is to develop and commercialize novel FDA-compliant cannabinoid pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, and related technologies for diseases, disorders and medical conditions. The Company is utilizing cannabinoids as the active pharmaceutical ingredients to develop synthetic pharmaceuticals in strict accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) pre-clinical and clinical pathways.
 
The Company’s current flagship research and development programs are focused on advancing formulations that have the potential to significantly improve the treatment outcomes of certain convulsive disorders and neuromuscular disorders. Subject to obtaining the necessary funding, the Company proposes to collaborate on pre-clinical research addressing convulsive disorders with a leading Ivy League medical school.
 
Our Objectives and Business Strategy
 
The Company has developed a three-pronged growth strategy:
 

1) | Drug development – Developing, licensing and commercializing cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals for specific medical conditions and disorders, which will be undertaken in accordance with FDA or comparable development pathways in other countries. Any medications the Company develops will be physician-prescribed. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Drug delivery system development – Developing and licensing proprietary delivery systems for cannabinoid medications, which would include parenteral (i.e., taken into the body in a manner other than through the digestive canal) formulations, as well as advanced tablet (oral and sublingual) technology. 
3) | Investment – Investing in companies and the acquisition of technologies, or medications, focused on cannabinoid-based research, through special purpose vehicles controlled by the Company. 

 
Our drug development strategy incorporates the following general steps:
 

● | determination of diseases, disorders and medical conditions that could potentially benefit from cannabinoid-based drugs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | conducting and assessing the technology landscape of potentially new therapeutic drugs along with “freedom to operate” investigations on these conditions; 
● | preparation and submission of patent applications world-wide and securing such applications and/or the licensing of existing patents; 
● | identifying the regulatory pathway with the FDA; and 
● | proceeding with pre-clinical studies and clinical trials under FDA protocols for submission and obtaining approval for the particular drug development project(s). 

 
We operate in a highly-controlled regulatory environment with strict regulations and established requirements by the FDA and drug regulatory agencies in other countries and jurisdictions, relating to analytical, toxicological and clinical standards and protocols with respect to the research and development of pharmaceuticals. Regulations specifically cover research, development, manufacturing and reporting procedures, both pre- and post-approval.

Governmental authorities in many countries require that a new pharmaceutical product be approved or exempted from approval before any such pharmaceutical product can be marketed. The time to obtain approval varies by country and some pharmaceutical drugs may fail in pre-clinical or clinical trials and therefore may never be approved. The approval process is typically a lengthy process that requires conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to seek and then hopefully receive regulatory approval, in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and the expenditure of substantial capital resources.
 
The steps required to obtain approval and the commercialization of a new drug in the United States are lengthy, complex and expensive, and the outcome is far from certain. These steps generally include:
 

● | completion of formulation studies, preclinical studies, and animal studies and in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory protocols; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to support animal and/or human clinical testing in the United States; 
● | approval by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) before each trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of controlled clinical trials in accordance with FDA regulations and with current good clinical practice (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each target indication; 
● | submission of an application for New Chemical Entity (“NCE”) or New Drug Application, (“NDA”), to the FDA; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“GMP”), and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NCE or NDA, as applicable. 

 
If a drug, such as those contemplated by the Company, contains a Controlled Substance and is categorized in Schedule I, II, or III under the U.S. Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it will likely require scheduling by the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) prior to any potential commercialization, which may never be achieved. This step may be required for drugs containing plant-derived cannabinoids, as well as synthetic cannabinoids.
 
The Company may establish a separate subsidiary for each of its drug development projects in order to provide additional flexibility regarding financing. Given the significant cost of drug development, the Company anticipates that it will need substantial additional financing and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available with terms and conditions satisfactory to the Company, if at all. Nevertheless, the Company believes that this corporate structure could provide the potential alternatives of either being able to finance its drug development activities at the parent level, or by potentially involving financial and/or strategic partners interested in a specific drug development direction, at the specific subsidiary level. In any of these situations, the Company’s ability to proceed with its drug development activities would be dependent upon its being able to obtain the requisite financing on terms that are acceptable to the Company, of which there can be no assurance. Nor can there be assurance that the Company will be able to obtain requisite financing in a timely manner.
 
Our Drug Development Activities
 
Due to the significant amount of financing needed to develop and commercialize a new drug and the Company’s limited resources, it is focusing its efforts on advancing formulations that have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of epilepsy and myotonic dystrophy.
Convulsive Disorders: Epilepsy and Refractory Epilepsy
 
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, or convulsions, associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It is caused by an imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission resulting in synchronous neural activity. Refractory epilepsy occurs when standard of care medicine is not bringing seizures under control. This condition, which may be called by other names, such as uncontrolled, intractable, or drug-resistant epilepsy, is not age specific. Up to one of every three epilepsy patients will develop what is considered refractory epilepsy.

Our near-term objective is to secure adequate funding to engage in sponsored research collaboration with a leading Ivy League university medical school in order to develop a pre-clinical proof of concept for the Company’s proposed parenteral-delivered formulations. CRx had entered into discussions and subsequently, into a Master Service Agreement (MSA) with the medical school prior to its acquisition by the Company. The study design involves pre-clinical mouse models in two phases: I – MTD and PK/PD modeling, and II – efficacy modeling in mice bred to be genetically prone to convulsions/seizures, with a primary focus of advancing a rigorous study design and improving new meritorious research and development by continued collaboration with our academic partners.
 
Myotonic Dystrophy
 
Myotonic dystrophy (“DM”) is part of a group of genetic disorders called muscular dystrophies, and is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. DM is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. People with this disorder often have prolonged muscle contractions (myotonia) and are not able to relax certain muscles after use. Also, affected people may have slurred speech or temporary locking of their jaw. Signs and symptoms overlap between DM Type 1 (“DM1”) and Type 2 (“DM2”), although DM2 tends to be milder than DM1. The muscle weakness associated with DM1 particularly affects the lower legs, hands, neck and face, while muscle weakness in DM2 primarily involves the muscles of the neck, shoulders, elbows, and hips. The two types of DM are caused by mutations in different genes.
 
The use of cannabinoid receptor modulators and/or terpenes for clinical symptom relief in DM patients has not been explored. Current scientific knowledge of the effects of cannabis on skeletal muscles or other multiple system symptoms in DM is rather limited. However, some anecdotal reports suggest that cannabis may be supportive in relief of the most common symptoms in both DM1 and DM2. Unfortunately, currently there is no standard treatment for these symptoms.
 
In February 2017, a provisional U.S. patent application was filed relating to the use of cannabinoid receptor modulators and/or terpenes to treat myotonic and muscular diseases such as dystrophia diseases (the “Sharir Development Project”). Our patent application relates to methods and compositions for treating such diseases with the use of cannabinoids and covers the administration of the drug(s) by such delivery systems as topical, oral, nasal, inhalation or a combination thereof. On February 19, 2018, a regular utility (non-provisional) U.S. Patent Application was filed relating to the use of cannabinoids and/or terpenes to treat dystrophies and myotonia. The application has been assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 15/899,160.
 
In April 2018, the Company retained Dr. Benedikt Schoser, a world-renowned expert in DM, to advise the Company. To elicit further information regarding whether DM patients have had any experience with cannabis and if so whether such experience has resulted in any symptom relief, a questionnaire was sent to a number of DM 1 and DM 2 patients by patient organizations. The results of the questionnaire suggest further exploration is appropriate. The survey was published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.
 
Shortly thereafter, a preliminary proof of concept examination under the guidance of Dr. Schoser was conducted with a preliminary formulation to obtain further insights. The results reflected that cannabis may be supportive in relief of DM symptoms and based upon the proof of concept examination and the survey, we will be conducting clinical studies. On August 13, 2019 we filed a pre-IND meeting request (the “Request”) to discuss the requirements for submission of an Investigation New Drug Application for a combination of Cannabidiol and THC Sublingual Tablet for muscle relaxation in patients with myotonic dystrophy and for the treatment of myotonia. On August 16, 2019 we received a response from the FDA where they stated that we should be receiving a written response regarding the Request on or about the middle of October 2019.
 
The FDA pathway for the development of drugs for certain of these genetic muscular diseases may fall under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which was passed by the U.S. Congress to facilitate the development of orphan drugs. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. Such an orphan drug designation may entitle a recipient to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. See risk factor “We may apply for orphan drug status granted by the FDA for some of our drug candidates for the treatment of rare diseases” below.

An additional utility patent application (US16/435,756) was filed as a continuation-in-part on June 10, 2019 to incorporate some early formulation concepts that may show use in the relief of these DM symptoms. A corresponding application has been filed at the European Patent Office (EP19179559.0)
 
Potential Future Development Projects
 
We have also filed utility patent applications related to researching and developing cannabinoid-based formulations and/terpenes for the treatment of lipidosis and leukodystrophy, and lipofuscinosis, an international patent application for restless legs syndrome and a utility patent application for sexual health issues. Reference is made to the table under the heading “Patents, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights” below.
The Organophosphorus Exposure Development Project
 
In March 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Kotzker Consulting, LLC (the “Kotzker License Agreement”), an entity founded, and related to certain intellectual property developed, by Pennsylvania-based Dr. Joseph Morgan. The intellectual property includes patent applications relating to the use of cannabinoid receptor modulators and/or terpenes in acute treatment situations during exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents and/or organophosphorus insecticides (the “Kotzker Development Project”). The Company’s patent counsel assumed responsibilities for the Kotzker Development Project patent applications, and has continued efforts to obtain patent protection on the invention. In furtherance of these efforts, a continuation application was filed in July 2018 and the Company is awaiting a response from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
 
Organophosphorus nerve agents are highly poisonous chemicals that work by preventing the nervous system from working properly and include tabun (Agent GA), sarin (Agent GB), soman (Agent GD), and Agent VX. Nerve agents and other organophosphate pesticides cause acetylcholinesterase inhibition, resulting in signs and symptoms such as pinpoint pupils, eye pain, sweating, drooling, tearing, vomiting, and seizure, also known as Pesticide Syndrome. Organophosphorus insecticides are chemicals used to kill many types of insects. These chemicals account for a large share of all insecticides used in the United States, including those used on food crops. Most home uses of organophosphorus insecticides have been phased out in the United States. Certain organophosphorus insecticides (e.g., malathion and naled) are also used for mosquito control in the United States.
 
We believe that a cannabinoid-based drug could be beneficial to treat the symptoms caused by organophosphorus nerve agents and we are hopeful that the regulatory pathway to treat the condition will be as expeditious as possible based upon the potential threat posed by the use of organophosphorus nerve agents by terrorists and countries.
 
On July 31, 2017, we submitted a pre-IND meeting package to the FDA to request comments on our proposed development plans. We received written responses from the FDA dated September 29, 2017, to questions that we raised in the pre-IND meeting request. In its response, the FDA presented pathway alternatives to progress our research and development plan and provided responses to a number of our questions. We are presently evaluating the responses as we seek to move our development plan forward.
 
On September 19, 2017, we entered into an agreement with a contract manufacturer with expertise in formulation and development for our drug candidate in the Kotzker Development Project with the objective of eventually applying for FDA approval. The contract manufacturer has been conducting formulation work with cannabidiol, Dronabinol and a placebo. In 2018, the contract manufacturer obtained a Schedule I license and quota for both CBD and THC to enable it to formulate product utilizing active pharmaceutical ingredients which it was able to obtain from companies experienced with FDA documentation requirements for active ingredients. Assuming the contract manufacturer is able to complete the formulation, pre-clinical studies will be performed, in accordance with applicable requirements, to determine if the formulation is safe and can be adequately characterized from the perspective of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Presuming the animal studies exhibit the appropriate safety profile, the Company will then make the appropriate submission to the FDA to seek approvals to conduct clinical studies under an Investigational New Drug exemption. The Company intends to meet with FDA before it conducts the clinical studies. Assuming the clinical studies meet the clinical endpoints, the Company will manufacture commercial lots, place three commercial size lots on stability and file a 505(b)(2) NDA. The Company estimates that the time from formulation completion to obtaining the approval for a product for the use and treatment immediately following exposure to organophosphorus and nerve agents would be approximately three to five years. The formulation of this drug candidate may be based on a synthetic cannabinoid, including Marinol or Dronabinol, or a synthetic CBD or a combination thereof and a blend of terpenes. We paid $75,000 to the contract manufacturer upon signing the contract, which requires us to pay an additional $20,000 upon completion of the drug formulation and $20,000 upon completion of Phase 1 development. No payment schedule has yet been agreed to upon completion of our Phase 2 and Phase 3 development stage and the contract may be terminated by either party.

Because of the implications of a nerve agent drug candidate for homeland defense, first responders and military applications, we may also seek government grants for funding the pre-clinical studies or clinical trials for this drug candidate. The Company has not investigated the existence or availability of any such grants, and there can be given no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such grants, if available.
 
Rights and Obligations under the Kotzker License Agreement
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Kotzker License Agreement, the Company has agreed to devote reasonable and practicable business efforts to develop and commercialize the Licensed Products (defined to mean any and all doses, strengths, formulations, compositions and methods thereof containing cannabinoids alone or in combination with various other active pharmaceutical ingredients and/or excipients). The Company will be responsible for the costs and efforts associated with the design, manufacturing, preclinical, clinical, and regulatory development activities of the Licensed Products world-wide.
 
In addition, the Company shall be responsible, and shall have sole decision-making authority, for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patent applications, patents pending, and patents included within the licensed patents (collectively, the “Patents”). In the event the Company determines to cease the preparation, filing, prosecution and/or maintenance of any Patents, then Kotzker Consulting shall have the right to assume responsibility for such preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of any such Patents. Prior to abandoning any Patent, the Company is required to provide Kotzker an adequate opportunity to assume such Patent prosecution at its own expense before the Patent application is deemed abandoned under applicable rules of the USPTO.
 
Commencing with the first commercial sale in any country worldwide of any Licensed Product by the Company or any of its affiliates or sublicensees, the Company shall pay to Kotzker Consulting royalties for Licensed Products sold until the later to occur of: (i) the expiration date of the last to expire of the Licensed Patents; or (ii) when a competitive generic product utilizing the Licensed Technology is marketed in a particular country. The royalties shall be equal to 3% of the Company’s net sales of Licensed Products or 10% of the total revenue received by the Company for sales of Licensed Products by sublicensees.
 
In addition to the royalty payments as described above, and as consideration for entering into the agreement, the Company agreed to: (i) pay Kotzker Consulting $180,000, (ii) pay patent prosecution costs incurred as of the date of the agreement of $15,000 and (iii) issue to Kotzker Consulting 31,550 shares of Kanativa Inc.’s common stock valued at $78,875 ($2.50 per share based on a contemporaneous private placement to third parties of Kanativa Inc.’s common stock).
 
The agreement also provides that development milestone payments will be paid by the Company to Kotzker Consulting as follows:
 

A. | for the use of the Licensed Products as a preventative and therapeutic neuroprotective against nerve agents and pesticides, the Company shall make a onetime payment of $500,000; and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. | for the use of the Licensed Products in the treatment of diseases, the Company shall make a one-time payment of $500,000. 

 
Upon approval of the first Licensed Product, Kotzker Consulting shall be issued US$180,000 value of the Company’s Common Stock based upon the share price determined at the most recent private placement price per share with an unrelated third party, or if the Company’s shares are publicly traded, the average closing price for the previous 30 days (the “Stock Consideration”).

If the parties determine that the development of the Licensed Product is unfeasible, as demonstrated by the failure to develop a formulation or to establish a satisfactory regulatory pathway or a determination that the formulation to be marketed may not be economically viable, but the Company elects to acquire an interest in the Licensed Patents, in consideration for the Company continuing to pay the cost of prosecuting the Licensed Patents and the issuance to Kotzker Consulting of the Stock Consideration referenced above, Kotzker Consulting and the Company shall, at the time the Company elects to no longer seek to develop the Product, agree that the Company shall acquire a 25% interest in the Licensed Patents, provided that the Company has paid Kotzker Consulting $180,000.
 
If either party shall fail to faithfully perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, the non-defaulting party may give written notice of the default to the defaulting party. Unless such default is corrected within 60 days after such notice, the notifying party may terminate the Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice; provided, however, in the event that prior to the expiration of any such 60-day period, such breaching party has in good faith commenced to use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such breach and the completion of such remedy, due to reasons beyond the control of such breaching party, requires more than 60 days to complete, then such 60-day period shall be extended for so long as such breaching party is continuing in good faith to use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such breach.
 
To date, the Company has paid Kotzker Consulting $180,000 and Kanativa Inc. has issued Kotzker Consulting 31,550 shares of Kanativa Inc. common stock as additional consideration valued at $78,875 on the date of issuance. Due to the Company’s current limited financial and personnel resources, the Company has estimated that it may not be able to recover the carrying value of costs capitalized under the Kotzker License Agreement in the near term, and has recognized an impairment of $302,915 for the year ended June 30, 2019. This accounting action does not affect the Company’s rights under the license agreement or its intention to monetize this asset when its resources permit.
 
The Lipidosis Development Project
 
In June 2018, we filed a utility U.S. patent application that claims the benefits of a provisional patent application that was filed in June of 2017 for methods and compositions to treat lipidoses and leukodystrophy, with cannabinoids and/or terpenes (the “Lipidosis Development Project”). The patent application methods involve the administration of a drug comprising of one or more cannabinoids and/or terpenes. Lipidosis is a term used to describe various lysosomal stage diseases in which there is abnormal accumulations of lipids in the reticuloendothelial cells. Leukodystrophy is generally classified as a disturbance of the white matter of the brain, particularly defects in the formation and maintenance of the white matter or myelin and includes a number of diseases that may also be included in the lipidoses classification. When the body is unable to properly digest fats, lipids accumulate in body tissues in abnormal amounts.
 
Potential diseases and medical conditions for our lipidoses and leukodystrophy drug candidate include:
 

● | Gaucher’s Disease | ● | Sulfatide Lipidosis 
--+-------------------------------------+---+---------------------------------
● | Neimann-Pick Disease | ● | Krabbe’s Disease 
● | Fabry’s Disease | ● | Canavan Disease 
● | Wolman’s Disease | ● | Adrenoleukosdystrophy 
● | van Bogaert’s Disease | ● | Alexander Disease 
● | Generalized (GM1) Ganliosidosis | ● | Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease 
● | Tay-Sachs Disease | ● | Salle Disease 

 
There is great variance in the symptoms, available treatments, and long-term consequences of these conditions. There are many different symptoms that accompany these disorders, some of which include chronic pain, in the palms, soles and abdomen, edema of the legs, osteoporosis, resulting in rigidity that leads to tonic seizures and convulsions. Some of these disorders can be controlled with changes in diet, medications, or enzyme supplements. However, for many of these diseases, no treatment is available. Some may cause death in childhood or contribute to a shortened life expectancy.
 
Leukodystrophy is very rare. The number of people affected depends on the specific disease, but for the cumulative diseases incidence is approximately one in 7,000 people. Some of these diseases have a higher prevalence in specific populations. Many are pediatric diseases or have a pediatric form.

The FDA pathway for the development of drugs as part of our Lipidosis Development Project falls under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which was passed to facilitate the development of orphan drugs. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a grant recipient of financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. See risk factor “We may apply for orphan drug status granted by the FDA for some of our drug candidates for the treatment of rare diseases” below.
 
The Lipofuscinosis Development Project
 
In June 2018, we filed a utility U.S. patent application that claims the benefit of a provisional patent application that was filed in June of 2017 for the method and compositions for treating Lipofuscinosis with cannabinoids and/or terpenes (the “Lipofucinosis Development Project”).
 
Lipofuscinosis is any disorder associated with the abnormal storage of lipofuscins. Lipofuscins is a yellow to brownish pigment granule found in the muscle, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal, retina and nerve cells undergoing slow regressive changes and accumulating in lysomes with age. Lipofuscin is the product of oxidation and polymerization of the membrane lipids of autophagocytosed organelles.
 
Lipofuscin accumulation is believed to be a major risk factor in macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, which is an inherited juvenile form of macular degeneration. Abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin in the nerve cells can result in neurodegenerative disorders, referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (“NCLs”). NCLs collectively are often referred to as Batten disease.
 
The FDA pathway for the development of drugs as part of our Lipofucinosis Development Project falls under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which was passed to facilitate the development of orphan drugs. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States.

See risk factor “We may apply for orphan drug status granted by the FDA for some of our drug candidates for the treatment of rare diseases” below.
 
The Restless Legs Syndrome Development Project
 
In June 2018, we filed under the International Patent Treaty an international patent application that claims the benefit of a provisional patent application that was filed in June of 2017 for methods and compositions to treat restless legs syndrome (“RLS”) with cannabinoids and/or terpenes. RLS, also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease and Wittmaack-Ekbom Syndrome, is a term used to describe a neurological sensory disorder that also interferes with sleep and is thus also considered a sleep disorder.
 
The symptoms of RLS include the compelling, irresistible, or uncontrollable urge to move, restlessness, and abnormal, unpleasant, or uncomfortable sensations in the limbs or the skin of the feet, legs, arms, or elsewhere which includes pain, aching, throbbing, pulling, itching, crawling, creeping, burning, jerking, fidgety, antsy, electrical, pins and needles, buzzing, and twitching. The movements may be persistent, repetitive, periodic, or intermittent with symptoms.
 
The Sexual Health Development Project
 
In June 2018, we filed a utility patent application that claims the benefits of a provisional U.S. patent application that was filed in June of 2017 for method and compositions to treat sexual dysfunctions with cannabinoids and/or terpenes.
 
Sexual dysfunction may be the result of organic issues, psychological issues or a combination of both. Examples of organic issues include vascular diseases, such as those associated with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, prescription medication, and/or by psychiatric disease such as depression. Examples of psychological factors include fear, performance anxiety and interpersonal conflict. Sexual health issues and sexual dysfunction issues in particular may impair sexual performance, diminish self-esteem and disrupt personal relationships thereby inducing personal distress.

Our Drug Delivery System Development Activities
 
Accu-Break License Agreement
 
On February 28, 2018, we obtained a worldwide exclusive license from Accu-Break Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Accu-Break”) with respect to a proprietary delivery system for cannabinoid-based medications. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more products utilizing the licensed technology and will be responsible for the costs and efforts associated with the design, manufacturing, preclinical, clinical, and regulatory development activities of these licensed products worldwide.
 
Commencing with the first commercial sale in any country worldwide of any licensed product by the Company or any of its affiliates or sublicensees, the Company shall pay to Accu-Break royalties for licensed products sold, equal to 4% of the Company’s net sales of licensed products or 25% of the total revenue received by the Company for sales of licensed products by sublicensees. Such royalties shall continue so long as the manufacture, use, sale, import or offer for sale of the licensed product infringes a valid claim of Accu-Break’s licensed technology.
 
In addition to the royalty payments described above, and as consideration for entering into the agreement, the Company agreed to pay Accu-Break a license fee of $100,000, of which $35,000 was paid upon execution of the agreement, $10,000 in November 2018 and $20,000 in February 2019. The remaining $35,000 payment originally due February 28, 2019 was extended to August 31, 2019 and has been paid in shares of Common Stock of the Company.
 
The Company is also required to pay in cash or, at its option in shares of its Common Stock, milestone payments as follows:
 

● | $100,000 upon approval of filing by each regulatory authority of each pharmaceutical licensed product; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | $100,000 upon approval by each regulatory authority of each pharmaceutical licensed product; 
● | $50,000 upon achievement of $10,000,000 of cumulative net sales for any and all of the licensed products; 
● | $50,000 upon achievement of $25,000,000 of cumulative net sales for any and all of the licensed products; and 
● | $50,000 upon achievement of $50,000,000 of cumulative net sales for any and all of the licensed products. 

 
The license fee and milestone payments shall be offset against any amounts due to Accu-Break for royalties and sublicensee payments.
 
The license granted to the Company shall continue on a country by country basis and licensed product by licensed product basis so long as the manufacture, use, sale, import or offer for sale of such licensed product infringes a valid claim of any of Accu-Break’s licensed technology. Upon such expiration, the license, with respect to such country and such licensed product, will be automatically converted to a fully paid-up royalty-free perpetual license.
 
The license may be terminated by Accu-Break only for the Company’s default under the Agreement, which default shall not have been corrected within 60 days of having received notice of such default.
 
Due to the Company’s current limited financial and personnel resources, the Company has estimated that it may not be able to recover the carrying value of costs capitalized under the Accu-Break license agreement in the near term, and has recognized an impairment of $65,000 for the year ended June 30, 2019. This accounting action does not affect the Company’s rights under the license agreement or its intention to monetize this asset when its resources permit.
 
Market Opportunities for Our Drug Development Projects
 
Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are seeking to capitalize on the anticipated growth in the pharmaceutical market for cannabinoid-based drugs by realizing and leveraging the growing set of data on the therapeutic effects of cannabis and cannabinoids. We believe that the potential applications for cannabinoids go beyond the three cannabinoid-based drugs derived from isolated synthetics: Marinol, Syndros and Casamet that have been approved by the FDA. We also believe that additional potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid-based drugs lies in the treatment of certain neurological disorders, as indicated by our drug development projects.

It is likely that the pharmaceutical market for cannabinoid-based drugs will eventually be classified as part of the specialty pharmaceutical market, the fastest growing segment of the overall pharmaceutical market. The increasing diagnoses of certain chronic diseases have resulted in the increased need for specialty drugs. According to an April 2014 report published by the United Health Care Group, “The Growth of Specialty Pharmacy,” spending on drug development projects in the specialty pharmaceutical market in the U.S. in 2012 approximated $87 billion, and is estimated to reach $400 billion by 2020.
 
Cannabinoids have a diverse pharmacology and therefore could provide significant potential for therapeutic applications across many diseases, disorders and medical conditions in areas that define specialty pharmaceutical drugs. We believe that a conservative estimate on spending on drug development projects in the cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical market sector could represent 5% of the overall specialty pharmaceutical market by the year 2020, which would suggest a market size of around $20 billion. According to Statista, an online statistic, market research and business intelligence portal that provides access to data from market and opinion research institutions, the U.S. market for cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals will increase to $50 billion by 2029. We believe these estimates are reasonable given the significant amounts of capital that have been allocated for the development of cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals by numerous companies in the U.S. and globally, with the objective of obtaining regulatory approval by the FDA and other international regulatory authorities.
 
Researchers have discovered approximately 111 cannabinoids, chemical compounds unique to the cannabis plant. The most common are cannabidiol (“CBD”), cannabinol (“CBN”) and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). CBN and THC interact with CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are located throughout the human body. CB1 receptors are primarily located in the brain and central nervous system. CB2 receptors are located throughout the body including the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts that are responsible for regulating neurotransmission. The CB1 and CB2 receptors help control bodily reactions such as inflammation and pain, which are areas are of great therapeutic interest with respect to drug development. Identifying cannabinoid receptors and the compounds that interact with them has helped accelerate clinical investigations of cannabinoid-based drugs. To date, due to the challenges of researching plant-derived cannabinoids in the United States, most U.S. research has been conducted utilizing synthetically produced cannabinoids, which as chemical compounds, are chemically identical to plant-derived cannabinoids.
 
We believe cannabinoid-based drugs may provide a superior treatment model for patients suffering from certain diseases, disorders and medical conditions. Due to FDA and DEA restrictions, most companies involved in research and development of cannabinoid therapeutic applications currently use synthetics. These cannabinoid-based drug candidates typically, use CBD and THC, or a combination thereof, as their active ingredient(s). At present, there are two synthetic “THC” cannabinoids available, dronabinol and nabilone. Both have been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have not responded adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. Dronabinol capsules were also approved for treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. They are also often prescribed for pain control, as alternatives to opioids.
 
We believe that there will be rising demand for cannabinoid-derived drugs and that future growth is likely to be driven by favorable changes in legislation and demographic factors. Controlled substance laws differ between countries and legislation in certain countries may restrict or limit our ability to distribute or sell our drugs. We believe that the U.S. will represent a major market for our cannabinoid-based drug candidates. In the European Community, medical cannabis program regulatory frameworks exist in countries, including the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic. It is also anticipated that there will be policy changes in many member countries of the European Union regarding the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-derived drugs.
 
Patents, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
Our current patent applications are related to our drug development projects and their respective drug candidates. We intend to seek patent protection in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate, related to methods and compositions and proprietary technologies for the use of cannabinoids receptor modulators and/or terpenes to treat certain diseases, disorders and medical conditions.

13
--


To date, we have filed four utility patent applications that claim the benefit of provisional patent applications that were filed with the USPTO and one international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, all related to our drug development projects, specifically the use of cannabinoid receptor modulators and/or terpenes to treat certain diseases or medical conditions. Assuming the successful completion of clinical trials, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that we will be able to secure patent protection and retain applicable intellectual property rights.
 
The table below depicts the Company’s patent applications:
 

Description of the Patent Application filed With USPTO | Filing Date 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------
Method and Compositions for Treating Dystrophies and Myotonia | February 19, 2018 
Method and Compositions for Treating Lipidosis and Leukodystrophy | June 15, 2018 
Method and Compositions for Treating Lipofuscinosis | June 15, 2018 
Method and Compositions for Sexual Health | June 29, 2018 
Description of the International Patent Application Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty | Filing Date 
Method and Compositions for Treating Restless Legs Syndrome | June 20, 2018 

 
In addition, on June 5, 2015, a U.S. Patent Application was filed relating to the use of cannabinoid receptor modulators and/or terpenes to treat extreme health hazards due to exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents and/or organophosphorus insecticides.
 
As our research progresses, it is likely that we will file additional patent applications in conjunction with research related to our current drug development research projects including the Kotzker, Sharir, Lipidosis, Lipofucinosis, Restless Legs Syndrome, and Sexual Health Development Projects. We also plan to seek patent protection in the U.S. and other countries world-wide for future drug development projects and potentially technologies related to increased bioavailability and drug delivery technologies.
 
Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases where we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the drug candidate and/or proprietary technologies, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our drug candidates, and successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to protect our drug candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing by third parties is dependent on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities.
 
For each of our drug development projects, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including:
 

● | our available resources; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the number and types of patents already filed or pending; 
● | the likelihood of success of the drug candidate; 
● | the size of the commercial market; 
● | the presence of a potential competitor in the market; and 
● | whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights. 

 
The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. In addition, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our future patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all.

Competition
 
The emerging markets for cannabinoid-based drug research and development is and will likely remain competitive. In general, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs.
 
We expect that we will be required to compete with a variety of multinational pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, as well as drugs and processes being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors may develop or may already have developed drugs comparable or competitive with our drug candidates. Competitive therapeutic treatments for diseases, disorders and medical conditions that are included in our drug development projects have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that may enter the market would face fierce competition.
 
We are aware of a number of companies that are engaged in cannabinoid-based drug development. In addition, several other U.S.-based companies are in early stage discovery and preclinical development utilizing synthetic and/or plant-derived CBD and/or THC.
 
Established companies may have a competitive advantage due to their size and experiences, positive cash flows and institutional networks. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Due to these factors, our competitors may have a range of competitive advantages and may obtain regulatory approval of their drug candidates before we are able to develop or commercialize our drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours. Furthermore, some of these competitors may make acquisitions or establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to rapidly gain market share and/or increase their drug line.
 
Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies, such as ours, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We compete with large and small companies in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our research projects.
 
Government Laws and Regulations
 
As a development stage company that intends to have its drug candidates approved in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by regulatory agencies. The U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our drugs. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulations that are similar in nature and scope as those in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and the European Commission, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be successful.
The US Regulatory Framework for the Marijuana Industry
 
On January 4, 2018, United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a Memorandum for all United States Attorneys entitled “Marijuana Enforcement” (the “Sessions Memo”). The effect of the Sessions Memo has been to rescind the guidance issued on August 29, 2013 relative to medical marijuana enforcement under the Cole Memorandum (the “Cole Memo”).

15
--


The Sessions Memo instructs federal prosecutors to disregard the previous Obama-era Cole Memo guidance, and instead follow “the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions . . . as reflected in chapter 9-27.000 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual.” The Sessions Memo continues, stating, “[t]hese principles require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes in the community.”
 
The effect of the Cole Memo’s rescission remains to be seen. Since 1980, when chapter 9-27.000 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual was originally promulgated, the United States has undergone a dramatic shift in both national and state-level marijuana policy. In 1980, there were no states in the U.S. with marijuana decriminalization or legalization statutes. As of June 30, 2019, 33 states and the District of Columbia have enacted medical marijuana legislation in some form, with additional states considering similar legalization measures. As a result, the manner in which the factors identified in chapter 9-27.000 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (e.g. “seriousness of the crime,” “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and cumulative impact . . . in the community”) are considered and interpreted today as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, will likely be different than the way in which they were considered and interpreted in 1980.
 
On the same day of the Sessions Memo’s release, numerous government officials, legislators and federal prosecutors in states with medical and recreational marijuana statutes announced their intention to continue the Cole Memo-era status quo despite the DOJ’s decision to rescind it. The impact that this lack of uniformity between state and federal authorities could have on individual state cannabis markets and the businesses that operate within them is unclear and the enforcement of relevant federal laws is a significant risk. Please see disclosure under Item 1A - “Risk Factors” below.
 
United States
 
We intend to conduct some of our research and development relating to our drug candidates in the United States, at which time, our research and development, future manufacturing, distribution and sale of our drugs will become subject to the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulations promulgated thereunder. While cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, drugs approved for medical use in the United States that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts must be placed in Schedules II-V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the “accepted medical use” requirement. If any of our drug candidates will receive approval by the FDA, it must be listed by the DEA as a Schedule II or III controlled substance to be allowed for commercialization. Consequently, the manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use of our future drugs will be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA. In addition, individual states in the United States have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule our drugs.
The European Community
 
Even though we do not currently intend to conduct research and development in the European Community, we may do so in the future. Approximately 250 substances, including cannabis, are listed in the Schedules annexed to the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (New York, 1961, amended 1972), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 1971) and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (introducing control on precursors) (Vienna, 1988). The purpose of these listings is to control and limit the use of these drugs according to a classification of their therapeutic value, risk of abuse and health dangers, and to minimize the diversion of precursor chemicals to illegal drug manufacturers. The 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended in 1972 classifies cannabis as Schedule I (“substances with addictive properties, presenting a serious risk of abuse”) and as Schedule IV (“the most dangerous substances, already listed in Schedule I, which are particularly harmful and of extremely limited medical or therapeutic value”) narcotic drug. The 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances classifies THC - the principal psychoactive cannabinoid of cannabis - as a Schedule I psychotropic substance (“substances presenting a high-risk of abuse, posing a particularly, serious threat to public health which are of very little or no therapeutic value”).

16
--


Most countries in Europe are parties to these conventions which govern international trade and domestic control of these substances, including cannabis. They may interpret and implement their obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining manufacturing and/or marketing approval for our drugs in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our drug candidates to be manufactured and/or marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period. While some countries in Europe including the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Romania, and Finland have decriminalized cannabis or permit its use for medical purposes, no country has completely legalized it, although adult-use of recreational cannabis was legalized in Canada on October 17, 2018.
 
Israel
 
If we intend to develop drugs containing cannabis plant-derived cannabinoids, we may conduct our research and development activities in Israel. The cannabinoid-based drugs we intend to develop, contain controlled substance (cannabis) as defined in the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance [New Version], 5733 - 1973. In Israel, licenses to cultivate, possess and to use cannabis for medical research are granted by the Ministry of Health, IMCU - Israel Medical Cannabis Unit, on an ad-hoc basis. If we proceed in Israel, we intend to obtain necessary IMCU licenses to carry out our drug development projects. This will require our acquiring the cannabis needed for our research activities from an Israeli government-licensed medical cannabis grower. Because we do not have a license to possess cannabis, the cannabis that will be required for our studies must be transported from the licensed grower directly to our research facilities or those of a contract research organization, in compliance with a license to use cannabis for medical research. If we proceed with research in Israel, we will apply for all necessary licenses needed to conduct our drug development projects. There can be given no assurance that we will obtain all necessary licenses and approvals.
Regulations Related to the Drug Regulatory Process
 
We operate in a highly controlled regulatory environment. Strict regulations establish requirements relating to analytical, toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect to the testing of pharmaceuticals. Regulations also cover research, development, manufacturing and reporting procedures, both pre- and post-approval. Failure to comply with regulations can result in stringent sanctions, including product recalls, withdrawal of approvals, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. Further, many countries have stringent regulations relating to the possession and use of cannabis or drugs derived from cannabis
 
Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our future drug candidates, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that our drug candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials often have not accurately predicted results of later clinical trials. In addition, many pharmaceuticals have shown promising results in clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy results to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.
 
We expect to incur substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, preclinical studies and clinical trials. Many factors can delay the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials, including the inability to recruit patients at the expected rate, the inability to follow patients adequately after treatment, the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials, and the emergence of unforeseen safety issues and governmental and regulatory delays. If a drug candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, this failure may delay development of other drug candidates and hinder our ability to conduct related preclinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, if we have failures, we may also be expected to experience challenges, delays or even the inability to obtain additional financing at acceptable terms and conditions.
 
Governmental authorities in all major markets require that a new drug be approved or exempted from approval before it is marketed, and have established high-standards for technical appraisal, which can result in an expensive and lengthy approval process. The time to obtain approval varies by country and some drugs are never approved. The lengthy process of conducting clinical trials, seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, if approval is obtained, are very costly and require the expenditure of substantial resources.

United States
 
In the United States, the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the safety and effectiveness standards for our drugs and the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of drug candidates on a product-by-product basis.
 
Preclinical tests include in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the drug candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing, testing, a sponsor files an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, to begin human testing. Typically, a manufacturer conducts a three-phase human clinical testing program which itself is subject to numerous laws and regulatory requirements, including adequate monitoring, reporting, record keeping and informed consent. In Phase I, small clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety and proper dose ranges of drug candidates. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of drug candidates. In Phase III, clinical trials are conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy. The time and expense that will be required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing within any specific period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB are responsible for approving and monitoring the clinical trials at a given site, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, where one is used, or we may suspend the clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk.
 
If the clinical data from these clinical trials (Phases I, II and III) are deemed to support the safety and effectiveness of the drug candidate for its intended use, then we may proceed to seek to file with the FDA, a New Drug Application, or NDA, seeking approval to market a new drug for one or more specified intended uses. We have not completed our clinical trials for any candidate drug for any intended use and therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the clinical data will support and justify filing an NDA. Nevertheless, if and when we are able to ascertain that the clinical data supports and justifies filing an NDA, we intend to make such appropriate filing.
 
The purpose of the NDA is to provide the FDA with sufficient information so that it can assess whether it should approve the drug candidate for marketing for specific intended uses. The fact that the FDA has designated a drug as an orphan drug for a specific intended use does not mean that the drug has been approved for marketing. Only after an NDA has been approved by the FDA is marketing allowed. A request for orphan drug status must be filed before the NDA is filed. The orphan drug designation, though, provides certain benefits, including a seven-year period of market exclusivity subject to certain exceptions.
 
The NDA normally contains, among other things, sections describing the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, microbiology, the results of the clinical trials, and the proposed labeling which contains, among other things, the intended uses of the candidate drug.
 
We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic drug in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. The FDA has substantial discretion over the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted. The process may be significantly extended by requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential drugs for a considerable period and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our drugs on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Even if a drug receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses and these limitations may adversely affect the commercial viability of the drug. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals, would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 

18
--


Even after we obtain FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials (i.e., Phase IV trials) and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness. We are also required to gain separate approval for the use of an approved drug as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the drug’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the drug from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us.
 
As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved drugs, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of drugs that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved drug or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved drug. The FDA may then approve the new drug for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced listed drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the NDA. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new drug must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved drug, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved drug in the FDA’s “Orange Book” publication. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new drug. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its drugs only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its drugs may be commercialized.
 
In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of such drugs prior to providing approval to market a drug.
 
We may also be subject to various federal, state and international laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal Anti-kickback law, which governs federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), makes it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a specific drug. Many states have similar laws that are not restricted to federal healthcare programs. Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursement, including claims for the sale of drugs or services, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. If the government or a whistleblower were to allege that we violated these laws there could be a material adverse effect on us, including our stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A finding of liability under these laws could have significant adverse financial implications for us and can result in payment of large penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. We will consult appropriate legal counsel concerning the potential application of these and other laws to our business and our sales, marketing and other activities and will make good faith efforts to comply with them. However, given their broad reach and the increasing attention given by law enforcement authorities, we cannot assure you that some of our activities will not be challenged or deemed to violate some of these laws.

Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, orphan drug designation may nevertheless be available if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, a drug that has received orphan drug designation is eligible for financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. The Orphan Drug Act provides that, if a designated drug is approved for the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the approved drug will be granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA generally will not approve any other application for a drug containing the same active moiety for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as a reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the drug is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Products that qualify for orphan designation may also qualify for other FDA programs that are intended to expedite the development and approval process and, as a practical matter, clinical trials for orphan products may be smaller, simply because of the smaller patient population. Nonetheless, the same approval standards apply to orphan-designated products as for other drugs. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Priority Review, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Accelerated Approval
 
The FDA has programs to expedite submission and consideration of certain drug drugs that address serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. An application for a drug will receive priority review designation if it is for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review means that FDA will seek to complete its first-cycle review and take action on the application within six months rather than the customary ten-month standard review period. An applicant may request priority review at the time it submits its application. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
Additionally, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. If a drug receives fast track designation, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review. Products with fast track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the drug’s development. Other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review include accelerated approval (approval based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit) and breakthrough therapy designation, which is available for drugs under development for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. If a drug receives breakthrough therapy designation, it will be eligible for the benefits of fast track designation, as well as for more intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from the agency to involve senior FDA managers in such guidance. Even if a drug qualifies for fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for these designations, and/or may determine that the drug does not meet the standards for approval.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
European and Other International Government Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our drugs. Regardless of whether we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”), much like the submissions of an IND in the U.S. prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the national health authority of each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 
To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. In the European Union, marketing authorization for a drug can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or the national procedure of an individual EU Member State. In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant may submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA. The agency will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization that permits the marketing of a drug in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Associations, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal drugs, including orphan drugs, drugs derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy drugs and certain other drugs containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases. This route is optional for certain other drugs, including drugs that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health.
 
Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the drug is to be marketed. This application process is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
 
The mutual recognition procedure is similarly based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a drug by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
 
For countries outside of the European Union, including countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

In the European Union if a marketing authorization is granted for a drug containing a new active substance, that drug benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that drug may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic drugs may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.
 
Orphan Drug Designation in the European Union
 
In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of drugs that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, orphan drug designation is granted for drugs intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the drug. Once authorized, orphan drugs are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar drugs with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal drug with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal drug or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar drug with the same orphan indication if this latter drug is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan drug. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated based on available evidence that the original orphan medicinal drug is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Accelerated Review
 
Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding “clock stops,” when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal drug is expected to be of a major public health interest. Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
Well-Established Medicinal Use
 
Under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, an applicant may, in substitution for the results of its own preclinical and clinical research, present detailed references to published literature demonstrating that the active substance(s) of a drug have a well-established medicinal use within the community with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. The applicant is entitled to refer to a variety of different types of literature, including reports of clinical trials with the same active substance(s) and epidemiological studies that indicate that the constituent or constituents of the drug have an acceptable safety/efficacy profile for a particular indication. However, use of the published literature exemption is restricted by stating that in no circumstances will constituents be treated as having a well-established use if they have been used for less than 10 years from the first systematic and documented use of the substance as a medicinal drug in the EU. Even after 10 years of systematic use, the threshold for well-established medicinal use might not be met. European pharmaceutical law requires the competent authorities to consider among other factors, the period over which a substance has been used, the amount of patient use of the substance, the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (as reflected in the scientific literature) and the coherence (consistency) of all the scientific assessments made in the literature. For this reason, different substances may reach the threshold for well-established use after different periods, but the minimum period is 10 years. If the applicant seeks approval of an entirely new therapeutic use compared with that to which the published literature refers, additional preclinical and/or clinical results is required.

Informed Consent
 
Under Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, following the grant of a marketing authorization the holder of such authorization may consent to a competent authority utilizing the pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical documentation that it submitted to obtain approval for a medicinal drug to assess a subsequent application relating to a medicinal drug possessing the same qualitative and quantitative composition with respect to the active substances and the same pharmaceutical form.
Law Relating to Pediatric Research
 
Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 (as amended by Regulation (EC) 1902/2006) was adopted on December 12, 2006. This Regulation governs the development of medicinal drugs for human use to meet the specific therapeutic needs of the pediatric population. It requires any application for marketing authorization made after July 26, 2008 in respect of a drug not authorized in the European Community on January 26, 2007 (the time the Regulation entered into force), to include the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan agreed by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, unless the drug is subject to an agreed waiver or deferral or unless the drug is excluded from the scope of Regulation 1902/2006 (generics, hybrid medicinal drugs, biosimilars, homeopathic and traditional (herbal) medicinal drugs and medicinal drugs containing one or more active substances of well-established medicinal use). Waivers can be granted in certain circumstances where pediatric studies are not required or desirable. Deferrals can be granted in certain circumstances where the initiation or completion of pediatric studies should be deferred until appropriate studies in adults have been performed. Moreover, this regulation imposes the same obligation from January 26, 2009 on an applicant seeking approval of a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a drug already authorized and still protected by a supplementary protection certificate granted under Regulation EC 469/2009 and its precursor (EEC) 1768/92 or by a patent that qualifies for the granting of such a supplementary protection certificate. The pediatric Regulation 1901/2006 also provides, subject to certain conditions, a reward for performing such pediatric studies, regardless of whether the pediatric results provided resulted in the grant of a pediatric indication. This reward comes in the form of an extension of six months to the supplementary protection certificate granted in respect of the drug, unless the drug is subject to orphan drug designation, in which case the 10-year market exclusivity period for such orphan drugs is extended to 12 years. If any of the non-centralized procedures for marketing authorization have been used, the six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate is only granted if the medicinal drug is authorized in all member states.
Post-authorization Obligations
 
In the pre-authorization phase the applicant must provide a detailed pharmacovigilance plan that it intends to implement post-authorization. An authorization to market a medicinal drug in the EU carries with it an obligation to comply with many post-authorization organizational and behavioral regulations relating to the marketing and other activities of authorization holders. These include requirements relating to post-authorization efficacy studies, post-authorization safety studies, adverse event reporting and other pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising, packaging and labeling, patient package leaflets, distribution and wholesale dealing. The regulations frequently operate within a criminal law framework and failure to comply with the requirements may not only affect the authorization, but also can lead to financial and other sanctions levied on the company in question and responsible officers. Because of the currently on-going overhaul of EU pharmacovigilance legislation the financial and organizational burden on market authorization holders will increase significantly, such as the obligation to maintain a pharmacovigilance system master file that applies to all holders of marketing authorizations granted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Marketing authorization holders must furthermore collect data on adverse events associated with use of the authorized drug outside the scope of the authorization. Pharmacovigilance for biological drugs and medicines with a new active substance will be strengthened by subjecting their authorization to additional monitoring activities. The EU is currently in the process of issuing implementing regulations for the new pharmacovigilance framework.

Any authorization granted by member state authorities, which within three years of its granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorized drug in the authorizing member state ceases to be valid. When an authorized drug previously placed on the market in the authorizing member state is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three consecutive years, the authorization for that drug shall cease to be valid. The same two three-year periods apply to authorizations granted by the European Commission based on the centralized procedure.
 
Israel
 
To conduct clinical testing on humans in Israel, special authorization must first be obtained from the ethics committee and general manager of the institution where the clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted, as required under the Guidelines for Clinical Trials in Human Subjects implemented pursuant to the Israeli Public Health Regulations (Clinical Trials in Human Subjects), as amended from time to time, and other applicable legislation. These regulations also require authorization from the Israeli Ministry of Health, except in certain circumstances, and in the case of genetic trials, special fertility trials and similar trials, an additional authorization of the overseeing institutional ethics committee. The institutional ethics committee must, among other things, evaluate the anticipated benefits that are likely to be derived from the project to determine if it justifies the risks and inconvenience to be inflicted on the human subjects, and the committee must ensure that adequate protection exists for the rights and safety of the participants as well as the accuracy of the information gathered from the clinical testing. If we intend to proceed with clinical studies in Israel, we will be required to obtain authorization from the ethics committee and general manager of each institution in which we intend to conduct our clinical trials, and in most cases, from the Israeli Ministry of Health.
 
Israel’s Ministry of Health, which regulates medical testing, has adopted protocols that correspond, generally, to those of the FDA and the EMA, making it comparatively straightforward for studies conducted in Israel to satisfy FDA and the European Medicines Agency requirements, thereby enabling medical technologies subjected to clinical trials in Israel to reach U.S. and EU commercial markets in an expedited fashion. Many members of Israel’s medical community have earned international prestige in their chosen fields of expertise and routinely collaborate, teach and lecture at leading medical centers throughout the world. Israel also has free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union.
 
The Development of Licensing of Proprietary Delivery Systems
 
We also intend to develop or license proprietary delivery systems for cannabinoid-based medications. We envision that these delivery systems may be utilized for some of the drugs that we seek to develop, and that we may also license them to third-parties. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop or license any delivery system.
 
The Investment in Companies or Acquisition of Technologies or Medications
 
We also intend to invest in companies or acquire technologies or medications based on cannabinoid-based science, possibly through special purpose vehicles formed or controlled by the Company. There is no assurance that we will be able to invest in any of these companies or acquire any technology or medication, nor that we will be successful in forming or acquiring capital for any special purpose vehicle for these purposes.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, all of our officers are serving without compensation and have no employees. To the extent not covered by the services of our offices, we expect to use third-party firms and individuals for our drug candidate development and management.
 
Our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement.
 
Research and Development Activities
 
We have incurred $63,858 and $116,791 during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on research and development for the Company. None of these research or development costs are borne by the customer.
