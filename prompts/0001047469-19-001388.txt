     Item 1.    Business. 
  General 
         We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT. We were incorporated in Maryland on December 20, 1982. We acquire, own and manage a geographically diversified portfolio consisting primarily of industrial, retail, restaurant, health and fitness and theater properties, many of which are subject to long-term leases. Most of our leases are "net leases" under which the tenant, directly or indirectly, is responsible for paying the real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs of the property. As of December 31, 2018, we own 119 properties and participate in joint ventures that own four properties. These 123 properties are located in 30 states and have an aggregate of approximately 10.4 million square feet (including an aggregate of approximately 373,000 square feet at properties owned by our joint ventures). 
        As of December 31, 2018:
 

 our 2019 contractual rental income (as described in "Our Tenants") is $69.4 million; 
 the occupancy rate of our properties is 99.2% based on square footage; 
 the weighted average remaining term of our mortgage debt is 8.7 years and the weighted average interest rate thereon is 4.26%; and 
 the weighted average remaining term of the leases generating our 2019 contractual rental income is 7.7 years. 

 2018 Highlights and Recent Developments 
         In 2018:
 

 our rental income, net, increased by $2.1 million, or 3.1%, from 2017. 
 we acquired eight industrial properties for an aggregate purchase price of $79.5 million. The acquired properties account for
$5.6 million, or 8.1%, of our 2019 contractual rental income. 
 we sold three properties for a net gain on sale of real estate of $5.3 million. The properties sold accounted for 3.0% and 4.7% of 2018
and 2017 rental income, net, respectively. 
 unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have 50% equity interest sold a (i) property and (ii) land parcel and the building
thereonour 50% share of the aggregate gains from these sales was $2.1 million, which is included in equity in earnings from sale of unconsolidated joint venture properties. 
 we obtained proceeds of $61.7 million from mortgage financings, including $14.7 million of refinanced amounts. 
 we raised net proceeds of approximately $3.1 million from the issuance of 126,300 shares of common stock pursuant to our at-the-market
equity offering program. 

         In the narrative portion of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as otherwise indicated:
 

 the information with respect to our consolidated joint ventures is generally described as if such ventures are our wholly owned subsidiaries
and information with respect to unconsolidated joint ventures is generally separately described, 
 (i) all references to joint ventures refer to unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) all interest rates with respect to debt give effect to
the related interest rate derivative, if any, (iii) amounts reflected as debt reflect the gross debt owed, without deducting deferred financing costs, 

 1

   

(iv) references
to industrial properties include properties (a) a portion of which may be used for office purposes and (b) that are used for distribution, warehouse and flex
purposes and (v) all calculations of occupancy rate reflect our assisted living facility in Round Rock, Texas as occupied. 


 2019 contractual rental income derived from multiple properties leased pursuant to a master lease is allocated among such properties based on
management's estimate of the appropriate allocations. 

 Acquisition Strategies 
         We seek to acquire properties throughout the United States that have locations, demographics and other investment attributes that we believe to be attractive. We believe that long-term leases provide a predictable income stream over the term of the lease, making fluctuations in market rental rates and in real estate values less significant to achieving our overall investment objectives. Our primary goal is to acquire single-tenant properties that are subject to long-term net leases that include periodic contractual rental increases or rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index. Periodic contractual rental increases provide reliable increases in future rent payments and rent increases based on the consumer price index provide protection against inflation. Historically, long-term leases have made it easier for us to obtain longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage financing with principal amortization, thereby moderating the interest rate risk associated with financing or refinancing our property portfolio and reducing the outstanding principal balance over time. We may, however, acquire a property that is subject to a short-term lease when we believe the property represents a favorable opportunity for generating additional income from its re-lease or has significant residual value. Although the acquisition of single-tenant properties subject to net leases is the focus of our investment strategy, we also consider investments in, among other things, (i) properties that can be re-positioned or re-developed, (ii) community shopping centers anchored by national or regional tenants and (iii) properties ground leased to operators of multi-family properties. We pay substantially all the operating expenses at community shopping centers, a significant portion of which is reimbursed by tenants pursuant to their leases. 
         Generally, we hold the properties we acquire for an extended period of time. Our investment criteria are intended to identify properties from which increased asset value and overall return can be realized from an extended period of ownership. Although our investment criteria favor an extended period of ownership, we will dispose of a property if we regard the disposition of the property as an opportunity to realize the overall value of the property sooner or to avoid future risks by achieving a determinable return from the property. 
         Historically, a significant portion of our portfolio generated rental income from retail properties. We are sensitive to the risks facing the retail industry and have been addressing our exposure thereto by seeking to acquire industrial properties (including warehouse and distribution facilities) and properties that capitalize on e-commerce activities, and by being especially selective in acquiring retail properties. As a result, retail properties generated 41.9%, 43.3%, and 46.1%, of rental income, net, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
         We identify properties through the network of contacts of our senior management and our affiliates, which contacts include real estate brokers, private equity firms, banks and law firms. In addition, we attend industry conferences and engage in direct solicitations. 
         Our charter documents do not limit the number of properties in which we may invest, the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any specific property or property type, or the concentration of investments in any region in the United States. We do not intend to acquire properties located outside of the United States. We will continue to form entities to acquire interests in real 
 2

   properties, either alone or with other investors, and we may acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities that own real property. 
         It is our policy, and the policy of our affiliated entities, that any investment opportunity presented to us or to any of our affiliated entities that involves the acquisition of a net leased property, a ground lease (other than a ground lease of a multi-family property) or a community shopping center, will first be offered to us and may not be pursued by any of our affiliated entities unless we decline the opportunity. Further, to the extent our affiliates are unable or unwilling to pursue an acquisition of a multi-family property (including a ground lease of a multi-family property), we may pursue such transaction if it meets our investment objectives. 
   Investment Evaluation 
         In evaluating potential investments, we consider, among other criteria, the following:
 

 the current and projected cash flow of the property; 
 the estimated return on equity to us; 
 an evaluation of the property and improvements, given its location and use; 
 local demographics (population and rental trends); 
 the terms of tenant leases, including co-tenancy provisions and the relationship between current rents and market rents; 
 the potential to finance or refinance the property; 
 an evaluation of the credit quality of the tenant; 
 the projected residual value of the property; 
 the ability of a tenant, if a net leased property, or major tenants, if a multi-tenant property, to meet operational needs and lease
obligations; 
 potential for income and capital appreciation; 
 occupancy of and demand for similar properties in the market area; and 
 alternate uses or tenants for the property. 

 Our Business Objective 
         Our business objective is to maintain and increase, over time, the cash available for distribution to our stockholders by:
 

 identifying opportunistic and strategic property acquisitions consistent with our portfolio and our acquisition strategies; 
 obtaining mortgage indebtedness (including refinancings) on favorable terms and maintaining access to capital to finance property acquisitions;
and 
 monitoring and maintaining our portfolio, including tenant negotiations and lease amendments with tenants that are renewing, expanding or
having financial difficulty; and 
 managing our portfolio effectively, including opportunistic and strategic property sales.

     Typical Property Attributes 
         As of December 31, 2018, the properties in our portfolio have the following attributes: 
 

 Net leases.  Most of our leases are net leases under which the tenant is
typically responsible for real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs. We believe that investments in net leased properties offer reasonably predictable returns. 
 Long-term leases.  Many of our leases are long-term leases. The weighted
average remaining term of our leases is 7.7 years. Leases representing approximately 28.3% of our 2019 contractual rental income expire between 2024 and 2027 and leases representing
approximately 31.7% of our 2019 contractual rental income expire in 2028 and thereafter. 
 Scheduled rent increases.  Leases representing approximately 75.8% of our
2019 contractual rental income provide for either periodic contractual rent increases or a rent increase based on the consumer price index.

  (1)
Our 2019 contractual rental income represents, after giving effect to any abatements, concessions or adjustments, the base rent payable to us in 2019 under leases in effect at December 31, 2018 (including $522,000 payable in 2019 by our Kmart tenant in Clemmons, NC which filed for bankruptcy protection). Excluded from 2019 contractual rental income is an aggregate of $3.7 million comprised of $900,000 of straight-line rent, $991,000 of amortization of intangibles, $349,000 of rent paid in January and February 2019 by our assisted living facility in Round Rock, Texas which filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2018, and $1.5 million representing our share of the base rent payable in 2019 to our unconsolidated joint ventures.

Eleven properties are net leased to Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc., which we refer to as Haverty Furniture, pursuant to a master lease covering all such properties. 
(3)
Includes six properties which are net leased to Office Depot pursuant to six separate leases. Five of the Office Depot leases contain cross-default provisions. 


        Many of our tenants (including franchisees of national chains) operate on a national basis including, among others, Advanced Auto, Applebees, Burlington Coat Factory, CarMax, the City of New York, CVS, Famous Footwear, FedEx, Ferguson Enterprises, LA Fitness, L-3, Marshalls, Northern Tool, Office Depot, PetSmart, Regal Cinemas, Ross Stores, Shutterfly, TGI Friday's, The Toro

   Company, Walgreens, Wendy's and Whole Foods, and some of our tenants operate on a regional basis, including Haverty Furniture and Giant Food Stores. 
   Our Leases 
         Most of our leases are net leases under which the tenant, in addition to its rental obligation, typically is responsible, directly or indirectly for expenses attributable to the operation of the property, such as real estate taxes and assessments, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs. The tenant is also generally responsible for maintaining the property and for restoration following a casualty or partial condemnation. The tenant is typically obligated to indemnify us for claims arising from the property and is responsible for maintaining insurance coverage for the property it leases and naming us an additional insured. Under some net leases, we are responsible for structural repairs, including foundation and slab, roof repair or replacement and restoration following a casualty event, and at several properties we are responsible for certain expenses related to the operation and maintenance of the property. 
         Generally, our leases provide for contractual rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease or for rent increases pursuant to a formula based on the consumer price index. Some leases provide for minimum rents supplemented by additional payments based on sales derived from the property subject to the lease (i.e., percentage rent). Percentage rent from (i) two properties contributed $122,000 to 2018 rental income and (ii) four properties contributed $263,000 to 2017 rental income. 
         Generally, our strategy is to acquire properties that are subject to existing long-term leases or to enter into long-term leases with our tenants. Our leases generally provide the tenant with one or more renewal options. 
         The following table sets forth scheduled expirations of leases at our properties as of December 31, 2018:

     Financing, Re-Renting and Disposition of Our Properties 
         Our revolving credit facility provides us with a source of funds that may be used to acquire properties, payoff existing mortgages, and to a more limited extent, invest in joint ventures, implement property improvements and for working capital purposes. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under our facility. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCredit Facility".
         We mortgage specific properties on a non-recourse basis, subject to the standard carve-outs described under "Item 2. PropertiesMortgage Debt", to enhance the return on our investment in a specific property. The proceeds of mortgage loans may be used for property acquisitions, investments in joint ventures or other entities that own real property, to reduce bank debt and for working capital purposes. 
         With respect to properties we acquire on a free and clear basis, we usually seek to obtain long-term fixed-rate mortgage financing, when available at acceptable terms, shortly after the acquisition of such property to avoid the risk of movement of interest rates and fluctuating supply and demand in the mortgage markets. We also will acquire a property that is subject to (and will assume) a fixed-rate mortgage. Substantially all of our mortgages provide for amortization of part of the principal balance during the term, thereby reducing the refinancing risk at maturity. Some of our properties may be financed on a cross-defaulted or cross-collateralized basis, and we may collateralize a single financing with more than one property. 
         After termination or expiration of any lease relating to any of our properties, we will seek to re-rent or sell such property in a manner that will maximize the return to us, considering, among other factors, the income potential and market value of such property. We acquire properties for long-term investment for income purposes and do not typically engage in the turnover of investments. We will consider the sale of a property if a sale appears advantageous in view of our investment objectives. If there is a substantial tax gain, we may seek to enter into a tax deferred transaction and reinvest the proceeds in another property. Cash realized from the sale of properties, net of required payoffs of the related mortgage debt, if any, required paydowns of our credit facility, and distributions to stockholders, is available for general working capital purposes and the acquisition of additional properties. 
   Our Joint Ventures 
         As of December 31, 2018, we own a 50% equity interest in four joint ventures that own four retail properties with approximately 373,000 square feet of space. At December 31, 2018, our investment in these joint ventures was approximately $10.9 million and the occupancy rate at these properties based on square footage, was 59.3%. See "Item 2. Properties" for information about, among other things, the occupancy rate at our joint venture properties. 
         Based on the leases in effect at December 31, 2018, we anticipate that our share of the base rent payable in 2019 to our joint ventures is approximately $1.5 million. Our multi-tenant community shopping center located in Manahawkin, New Jersey is expected to contribute 87.4% of the aggregate base rent payable by all of our joint ventures in 2019. Leases with respect to 17.9%, 29.1% and 53.0% of the aggregate base rent payable to all of our joint ventures in 2019 is payable pursuant to leases expiring from 2019 to 2020, from 2021 to 2022, and thereafter, respectively. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsChallenges Facing Certain Tenants and Properties" for information regarding our Manahawkin, New Jersey joint venture.

     Competition 
         We face competition for the acquisition of properties from a variety of investors, including domestic and foreign corporations and real estate companies, financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, investment funds, other REITs and individuals, many of which have significant advantages over us, including a larger, more diverse group of properties and greater financial (including access to debt on more favorable terms) and other resources than we have. 
 Our Structure 
         Nine employees, including Patrick J. Callan, Jr., our president and chief executive officer, Lawrence G. Ricketts, Jr., our executive vice president and chief operating officer, Justin Clair, a vice president, Benjamin Bolanos, a vice president, Karen Dunleavy, vice president-financial and four other employees, devote all of their business time to us. Our other executive, administrative, legal, accounting and clerical personnel provide their services to us on a part-time basis, which services generally are provided pursuant to the compensation and services agreement described below. 
         We entered into a compensation and services agreement with Majestic Property Management Corp. effective as of January 1, 2007. Majestic Property is wholly owned by our vice chairman of the board and it provides compensation to certain of our executive officers. Pursuant to this agreement, we pay Majestic Property for providing us with the services of executive, administrative, legal, accounting, clerical and property management personnel, as well as property acquisition, sale and lease consulting and brokerage services, consulting services with respect to mortgage financings and construction supervisory services (collectively, the "Services").The amount we pay Majestic Property for the Services is approved each year by the compensation and/or audit committees of our board of directors, and the independent directors. 
         In 2018, pursuant to the compensation and services agreement, we paid Majestic Property approximately $2.7 million plus $216,000 for our share of all direct office expenses, including rent, telephone, postage, computer services, supplies and internet usage. Included in the $2.7 million is $1.2 million for property management servicesthe amount for the property management services is based on 1.5% and 2.0% of the rental payments (including tenant reimbursements) actually received by us from net lease tenants and operating lease tenants, respectively. We do not pay Majestic Property with respect to properties managed by third parties. Based on our portfolio of properties at December 31, 2018, we estimate that the property management fee in 2019 will be approximately $1.2 million. 
         We believe that the compensation and services agreement allows us to benefit from (i) access to, and from the services of, a group of senior executives with significant knowledge and experience in the real estate industry and our company, (ii) other individuals who perform services on our behalf, and (iii) general economies of scale. If not for this agreement, we believe that a company of our size would not have access to the skills and expertise of these executives at the cost that we have incurred and will incur in the future. For a description of the background of our management, please see the information under the heading "Executive Officers" in Part I of this Annual Report. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding equity awards to individuals performing services on our behalf pursuant to the compensation and services agreement.
