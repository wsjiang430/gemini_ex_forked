OVERVIEW
Who We Are
IAC has majority ownership of both Match Group, which includes Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid, and ANGI Homeservices, which includes HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List and Handy, and also operates Vimeo, Dotdash and The Daily Beast, among many other online businesses.
As used herein, "IAC," the "Company," "we," "our," "us" and similar terms refer to IAC/InterActiveCorp and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
Our History
IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc. After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally, to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company.
From 1997 to 2005, we acquired a number of e-commerce companies, including Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com), Expedia.com, Match.com, LendingTree, Hotwire, TripAdvisor and AskJeeves. 
In 2005, we completed the separation of our travel and travel‑related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. (now known as Expedia Group, Inc.). In 2008, we separated into five independent, publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc. (now part of Qurate Retail, Inc.), Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (now part of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation), Ticketmaster (now part of Live Nation, Inc.) and Tree.com, Inc.
From 2008 to 2014, we continued to invest in and acquire e-commerce companies, including Meetic, About.com (now known as Dotdash), Dictionary.com and Investopedia. In 2015, we acquired Plentyoffish Media Inc. and completed the initial public offering of Match Group, Inc.
In 2016 and 2017, we completed the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor segment with those of Angie’s List, Inc. under a new publicly traded holding company that we control, ANGI Homeservices Inc. ("ANGI Homeservices"), as well as acquired controlling interests in MyHammer Holding AG, HomeStars Inc. and MyBuilder Limited, leading home services platforms in Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively. Through Vimeo, we acquired VHX, a platform for premium over-the-top (OTT) subscription video channels, and Livestream Inc., a leading live video solution. 
In 2018, through ANGI Homeservices, we acquired Handy Technologies, Inc., a leading platform in the United States for connecting consumers looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. We also acquired a controlling interest in BlueCrew, an on-demand staffing platform that connects temporary workers with traditional blue-collar jobs in areas like warehouse, delivery and moving, data entry and customer service. Lastly, we sold our Dictionary.com business, the television business of Electus (including Notional) and our Felix and CityGrid businesses.

EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE
IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and shares of Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis. As of the date of this report, Barry Diller, IAC’s Chairman and Senior Executive, his spouse (Diane von Furstenberg) and his stepson (Alexander von Furstenberg), collectively beneficially own 5,789,499 shares of Class B common stock representing 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Together with shares of common stock held as of the date of this report by Mr. von Furstenberg (61,685), a trust for the benefit of certain members of Mr. Diller’s family (136,711) and a family foundation (1,711), these holdings represent approximately 42.8% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC (based on the number of shares of common and Class B common stock outstanding on February 1, 2019). As of the date of this report, Mr. Diller also holds 1,050,000 vested options and 250,000 unvested options to purchase shares of common stock.
In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC’s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at least 5,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
As a result of IAC securities beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC’s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.

DESCRIPTION OF IAC BUSINESSES
Match Group
Overview
Our Match Group segment consists of the businesses and operations of Match Group, Inc. ("Match Group"). Through Match Group, we operate a portfolio of dating brands, including Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish, Meetic, OkCupid, OurTime, Pairs and Hinge, as well as a number of other brands, each designed to increase user likelihood of finding a meaningful connection. As of December 31, 2018, IAC’s ownership and voting interests in Match Group were 81.1% and 97.6%, respectively.
Services
Through Match Group, we are a leading provider of dating products all over the world through applications and websites that we own and operate. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 7.9 million Average Subscribers to our dating products (calculated by summing the total number of users who purchased one of our subscription-based dating products at the end of each day in the year ended December 31, 2018, divided by the number of calendar days in such year). 
Dating is a highly personal endeavor and consumers have a wide variety of preferences that determine what type of dating product they choose. As a result, our strategy focuses on a portfolio approach of various brands in order to reach a broad range of users. Our brands are collectively available in 40 languages to users all over the world. The following is a list of our key brands: 
Tinder. Tinder was launched in 2012, and has since risen to scale and popularity faster than any other product in the online dating category with limited marketing spend, growing to over 4.3 million subscribers today. Tinder’s distinctive "right swipe" feature has led to significant adoption among the millennial generation, previously underserved by the online dating category. Tinder employs a freemium model, through which users can enjoy many of the core features of Tinder for free, including limited use of the "swipe right" feature with unlimited communication with other users. However, to enjoy premium features, such as unlimited use of the "swipe right" feature, a Tinder user must subscribe to either Tinder Plus, launched in early 2015, or Tinder Gold, which was launched in late summer 2017. Tinder users and subscribers may also pay for certain premium features, such as Super Likes and Boosts, on a pay-per-use basis.
Match. Match was launched in 1995 and helped create the online dating category. Among its distinguishing features are the ability to search profiles, receive algorithmic matches and attend live events (promoted by Match) with other subscribers. Additionally, new features, such as Missed Connections, which uses location-based technology to enable users to connect with other users with whom they have crossed paths in the past, engage users into more meaningful connections. Match is a brand that focuses on users with a high level of intent to enter into a relationship and its product and marketing are designed to reinforce that approach. Match relies heavily on word-of-mouth traffic, repeat usage and paid marketing.
PlentyOfFish. PlentyOfFish was launched in 2003 and acquired in October 2015. Similar to Match, among its distinguishing features is the ability to both search profiles and receive algorithmic matches. Similar to Tinder, PlentyOfFish has grown to popularity over the years with very limited marketing spend and also relies on a freemium model. PlentyOfFish has broad appeal in the central United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and a number of other international markets. 
Meetic. Meetic, a leading European online dating brand based in France, was launched in 2001. Similar to Match, among its distinguishing features are the ability to search profiles, receive algorithmic matches and attend live events (promoted by Meetic) with other subscribers and non-subscribers from time to time. Also, similar to Match, Meetic is a brand that focuses on users with a high level of intent to enter into a relationship and its product and marketing are designed to reinforce that approach. Meetic relies heavily on word-of-mouth traffic, repeat usage and paid marketing.
4

OkCupid. OkCupid was launched in 2004, and has attracted users through a mathematical and Q&A approach to the online dating category. Similar to Tinder and PlentyOfFish, OkCupid has grown in popularity over the years without significant marketing spend and also relies on a freemium model. OkCupid has a loyal and highly educated user base predominately located in major cities in the United States and the United Kingdom.
OurTime. OurTime is the largest brand within our affinity-oriented brands. OurTime is the largest community of singles over age 50 of any dating product.
Pairs. Pairs was launched in 2012 and acquired in May 2015. Pairs is a leading provider of dating products in Japan, with a strong presence in Taiwan and a growing presence in certain other Asian countries. Pairs is a dating app that was specifically designed to address social barriers generally associated with the use of dating products in Asian countries, particularly Japan.
Hinge. Hinge was launched in 2012 and, following a series of investments, Match took a controlling stake in Hinge in June 2018 and purchased all of the remaining outstanding equity in December 2018. Hinge is a mobile-only experience and employs a freemium model. Hinge focuses on users with a high level of intent to enter into a relationship and its product is designed to reinforce that approach.
All of our dating products enable users to establish a profile and review the profiles of other users without charge. Each product also offers additional features, some of which are free and some of which are paid, depending on the particular product. In general, access to premium features requires a subscription, which is typically offered in packages (primarily ranging from one month to six months), depending on the product and circumstance. Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of subscription purchased, the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and whether or not a subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers. In addition to subscriptions, many of our dating products offer users certain features, such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other users, and these features are offered on a pay‑per‑use basis. The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand‑by‑brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
Revenue
Match Group revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscriptions. Revenue is also earned from online advertising, the purchase of à la carte features and offline events.
Marketing
Certain of our brands attract the majority of their users through word-of-mouth and other free channels. Our other brands rely on paid user acquisition efforts for a significant percentage of their users. Our online marketing activities generally consist of social media advertising, banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns, video advertising, business development or partnership deals and hiring influencers to promote our dating products. Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts, as well as events.
Competition
The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand globally. We compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products. 
In addition to other online dating brands, we compete with social media platforms and offline dating services, such as in‑person matchmakers. Arguably, our biggest competition comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | our ability to continue to increase consumer acceptance and adoption of online dating products, particularly in emerging markets and other parts of the world where the stigma is only beginning to erode;

5


• | continued growth in Internet access and smart phone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets;


• | the continued strength of Match Group brands;


• | the breadth and depth of Match Group active user communities relative to those of its competitors;


• | our ability to evolve our dating products in response to competitor offerings, user requirements, social trends, the ever-evolving technological landscape and the ever-changing regulatory landscape (in particular, as it relates to the regulation of online platforms);


• | our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our dating products;


• | our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies; and


• | the design and functionality of our dating products.

Lastly, since a large portion of online dating customers use multiple dating products over a given period of time, either concurrently or sequentially, we believe our broad portfolio of dating brands is a competitive advantage.
ANGI Homeservices
Overview
Through the ANGI Homeservices portfolio of digital home services brands, including HomeAdvisor®, Angie’s List® and Handy, we connect millions of homeowners to home service professionals, collect reviews and allow homeowners to research, match and connect on-demand to the largest network of service professionals online, through our mobile apps or by voice assistants. 
In addition to its market-leading U.S. operations, ANGI owns leading home services online marketplaces in France (Travaux), Germany (MyHammer), Netherlands (Werkspot), United Kingdom (MyBuilder), Canada (HomeStars) and Italy (Instapro), as well as operations in Austria (MyHammer). As of December 31, 2018, IAC’s economic and voting interests in ANGI Homeservices were 83.9% and 98.1%, respectively.
Our ANGI Homeservices segment consists of the North American (United States and Canada) and European businesses and operations of ANGI Homeservices, a publicly traded holding company that was formed to facilitate the combination of the businesses within our former HomeAdvisor segment with Angie’s List, Inc. ("Angie's List"), which transaction was completed on September 29, 2017 (the "Combination"). ANGI Homeservices acquired Handy Technologies, Inc. ("Handy"), a leading platform in the United States for connecting individuals looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals, in October 2018.
 Services
Overview. The HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service (formerly known as our HomeAdvisor domestic business ("HomeAdvisor")) connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online. HomeAdvisor also connects consumers with service professionals instantly by telephone, as well as offers several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different types of home services projects. Handy connects consumers looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals.
6

Together, we refer to the HomeAdvisor and Handy businesses in the United States as the "Marketplace." We provide all Marketplace matching services, related tools and directories to consumers free of charge.
As of December 31, 2018, the Marketplace had a network of approximately 214,000 service professionals, each of whom had an active network membership and/or paid for consumer matches (in the case of HomeAdvisor service professionals) or completed a job sourced through the Handy platform (in the case of Handy service professionals) in December 2018. Collectively, these service professionals provided services in more than 500 categories and 400 discrete markets in the United States, ranging from cleaning and installation services to simple home repairs and larger home remodeling projects. The Marketplace generated approximately 23.5 million service requests from over 13 million households during the year ended December 31, 2018. Service requests consisted of fully completed customer service requests submitted to HomeAdvisor and completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform.
Angie’s List connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories, as well as provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content (including verified reviews), to help them research, shop and hire for local services. We provide consumers with access to the Angie's List nationwide directory and related basic tools and services free of charge.
Marketplace Consumer Services. Consumers can submit a service request for a service professional directly through HomeAdvisor platforms, as well as indirectly through certain paths on some of our other branded platforms and various third-party affiliate platforms. In the case of service requests submitted through HomeAdvisor and third-party affiliate platforms, consumers are generally matched (through our proprietary algorithms) with up to four service professionals from the HomeAdvisor network of service professionals based on several factors, including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request. In the case of service requests submitted through our other branded platforms, consumers are generally matched (through our proprietary algorithms) with a combination of HomeAdvisor service professionals and service professionals from the relevant branded platform (as and if available for the given service request). 
Service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched directly and consumers can review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. Consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through any of our branded platforms or third-party affiliate platforms.
HomeAdvisor also provides several on-demand services, including Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending). Through Instant Booking, consumers can schedule appointments for select home services with a HomeAdvisor service professional instantly across certain HomeAdvisor platforms. Through Instant Connect, consumers can connect with a HomeAdvisor service professional instantly by phone, as well as through digital voice assistant platforms. In certain markets, HomeAdvisor also provides Same Day Service and Next Day Service for certain home services. In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access the online HomeAdvisor True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as a library of home services-related content.
Through the Handy platform, consumers can select the service they need and specify when (date and time) they want the service to be provided; this information is then used to match consumers with Handy service professionals. In certain markets, consumers can also submit a request to book a specific Handy service professional for a given job. In both cases, the service is then scheduled and paid for directly through the Handy platform. In addition, consumers who purchase furniture, electronics, appliances and other home-related items from select third-party retail partners online (and in certain markets, in store) can simultaneously purchase assembly, installation and other related services to be fulfilled by Handy service professionals. The service is then paid for directly through the applicable third-party retail partner platform and scheduled through the Handy platform. Consumers can also search for service professionals by zip code on the Handy platform and contact them through the Handy platform. 
Marketplace Service Professional Services. We primarily offer and sell HomeAdvisor memberships and related products and services to service professionals through our sales force (described below). The basic HomeAdvisor annual membership package includes membership in the HomeAdvisor network of service professionals, as well as access to consumer matches through HomeAdvisor platforms and a listing in the HomeAdvisor online directory and certain other affiliate directories, among other benefits. In addition to the membership subscription fee, HomeAdvisor service professionals pay fees for consumer matches. In the case of Handy, we provide service professionals who self-register on the Handy platform with access to a pool of consumers seeking service professionals. When a service is scheduled through the Handy platform, the related payment is processed and we charge the service professional a 
7

booking fee. We also offer certain other subscription products, primarily to HomeAdvisor service professionals, through mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud-based field service software for small to mid-size businesses, as well as custom website development and hosting services.
Angie's List Consumer Services. Through most Angie’s List platforms, consumers can currently register and search for a service professional in the Angie’s List nationwide online directory and/or be matched with a service professional. Consumers who register can access ratings and reviews and search for service professionals, as well as access certain promotions. For a fee, we offer two premium membership packages, which include varying degrees of online and phone support, access to exclusive promotions and features and the award-winning Angie’s List print magazine. 
Angie's List Service Professional Services. Angie’s List provides service professionals with a variety of services and tools, including certification. Generally, service professionals with an overall member grade below a "B" are not eligible for certification. Service professionals must satisfy certain criteria for certification, including retaining the requisite member grade, passing certain criminal background checks and attesting to proper licensure requirements. Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals must purchase term-based advertising from us to obtain certification. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 36,000 certified service professionals under contract for advertising. 
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in directory search results for an applicable category, with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, our proprietary algorithms will determine where a given service professional appears within related results.
Revenue
ANGI Homeservices revenue is primarily derived from: (i) consumer connection revenue, which consists of fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and booking fees from completed jobs sourced through the Handy platform, and (ii) membership subscription fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service. 
Revenue is also derived from: (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals and (ii) membership subscription fees from consumers. 
Marketing
ANGI Homeservices products and services are marketed to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid search engine marketing, display advertising and third-party affiliate agreements) and traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), as well as through e-mail. Pursuant to third-party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote HomeAdvisor products and services (and those of HomeAdvisor service professionals) on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, these third parties are paid a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through and submit a valid service request through HomeAdvisor, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to HomeAdvisor. ANGI Homeservices products and services are also marketed to consumers through relationships with select third-party retail partners and, to a lesser extent, through partnerships with other contextually related websites and direct mail. 
We market subscription packages and related products and services to service professionals primarily through our Golden, Colorado based sales force, as well as through sales forces in Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado, Lenexa, Kansas, New York, New York, Indianapolis, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois. We also market these products and services, together with our various directories, through paid search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. We market term-based advertising and related products to service professionals primarily through our Indianapolis based sales force.
8

Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. ANGI Homeservices competes with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe our biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which is by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the size, quality, diversity and stability of our network of service professionals and the breadth of our online directory listings;


• | the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as our continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally;


• | our ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, our various brands, particularly our Angie’s List, HomeAdvisor and Handy brands;


• | our ability to consistently generate service requests and jobs through the Marketplace and leads through our online directories that convert into revenue for our service professionals in a cost-effective manner; and


• | the quality and consistency of our service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.

Vimeo
Overview 
Vimeo operates a global video platform for creative professionals, marketers and enterprises to connect with their audiences, customers and employees. Vimeo provides cloud-based software products to stream, host, distribute and monetize videos online and across devices, as well as premium video tools on a subscription basis. Vimeo also sells live streaming accessories. 
Platform
Through Vimeo’s Platform business, we provide basic video hosting and sharing capabilities free of charge. We also provide various packages of premium video tools via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model on a subscription basis (monthly or annual). Package capabilities may include additional video storage and high quality live streaming capabilities, robust video privacy controls, video player customization options, team collaboration and management tools, review and workflow tools, detailed analytics, lead generation and marketing tools, priority support and the ability to sell videos directly to consumers in a customized viewing experience, with the precise mix of capabilities dependent upon the tier of package purchased. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 952,000 subscribers to Vimeo’s SaaS offering.
Vimeo also operates two marketplaces for buying and selling videos, the Vimeo on Demand store and the Vimeo Stock store. Through the Vimeo on Demand store, subscribers may offer their videos for sale to their audiences. Through the Vimeo Stock store, Vimeo offers stock video footage from certain licensors. In both cases, Vimeo earns fees from the sale of video content.
Hardware
Through Livestream, we sell a number of live streaming accessories, including hardware devices for capturing, broadcasting and editing live video and the Mevo® camera, a pocket-sized device that allows broadcasters to professionally stream and edit live video. We also sell hardware equipment for customers with more sophisticated live 
9

streaming needs, such as 4K encoding, multi-camera switching and on-screen graphics. Our hardware devices enable customers to stream video of their events through Vimeo software, as well as to multiple third-party platforms simultaneously. Subscribers to our SaaS offering can host, distribute and monetize live video edited with these hardware devices through Vimeo platforms.
Marketing and Sales
We market Vimeo services primarily through online marketing efforts, including paid search engine marketing, social media, e-mail campaigns, display advertising and affiliate marketing. We also market these products and services through offline marketing efforts, including outdoor advertising, offline events and product integrations, as well as directly through our self-serve websites and apps. Vimeo services and products can be purchased directly through our self-serve websites and apps, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and our sales force, and in the case of livestreaming accessories only, through a network of retailers and distributors. 
Revenue
Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from annual and monthly SaaS subscription fees paid by creators for premium capabilities and, to a lesser extent, sales of live streaming hardware, software and professional services. 
Competition
Vimeo competes with a variety of online video platforms, from free, ad-based video sharing services directed at consumers to niche workflow and distribution solutions directed at professionals and enterprises. We believe that Vimeo differentiates itself from its competitors by providing an ad-free, high quality user experience and one-stop professional solution that is easy to use and affordable. 
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the quality of our technology platform, video tools and user experience;


• | whether our SaaS subscription offering and live streaming accessories resonate with consumers;


• | the continued ability of users to distribute Vimeo-hosted content across third-party platforms and the prominence and visibility of such content within search engine results and social media platforms;


• | the recognition and strength of the Vimeo brand relative to competitor brands;


• | our ability to host and stream high-bandwidth video on a scalable platform;


• | our ability to retain existing subscribers by continuing to provide a compelling value proposition and convert non-paying users into subscribers; and


• | our ability to drive visitors to our platform through various forms of direct marketing.

 Marketing

Competition
Dotdash competes with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers. Competitors primarily include other online publishers and destination websites with brands in similar vertical content categories and social channels.
Some of our current competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger user bases and/or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their content, which could result in greater market acceptance of their content relative to our content.
We believe that the ability of Dotdash to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the quality of the content and features on our websites, relative to those of our competitors;


• | our ability to successfully create or acquire content (or the rights thereto) in a cost-effective manner;

11


• | the relevance and authority of the content featured on our websites; and


• | our ability to successfully drive visitors to our portfolio of digital brands in a cost-effective manner.

Through Mosaic Group, we are a leading provider of global subscription mobile applications. Mosaic Group consists of the following businesses that we own and operate: Apalon, iTranslate (acquired in March 2018), TelTech (acquired in October 2018) and Daily Burn. 
Apalon is a leading mobile development company with one of the largest and most popular application portfolios worldwide. iTranslate develops and distributes applications that enable users to read, write, speak and learn foreign languages anywhere in the world. TelTech develops and distributes unique and innovative mobile communications applications that help protect consumer privacy. Daily Burn is a health and fitness property that provides streaming fitness and workout videos across a variety of platforms (including iOS, Android, Roku and other Internet-enabled television platforms).  
Through Mosaic Group, collectively, we operated 39 branded mobile applications in 28 languages across 173 countries as of the date of this report. Our branded mobile applications consist of applications spanning a variety of categories, each designed to meet the varying and unique needs of our subscribers and enhance their daily lives, including: iTranslate, through which subscribers can connect and communicate across over 100 languages; Robokiller, which thwarts telemarketing spam phones calls; and NOAA Radar, which provides up-to-date weather information and storm tracking worldwide. We distribute our branded mobile applications to our subscribers primarily through the Apple App and Google Play stores.
Revenue
Desktop revenue largely consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites. The substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our Desktop business is supplied to us by Google Inc. ("Google") pursuant to our services agreement with Google.

Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Desktop businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results. This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries. Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages. Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Desktop businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us. See "Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google."
To a lesser extent, Desktop revenue also includes fees related to subscription downloadable desktop applications, as well as display advertisements. 
Mosaic Group revenue consists primarily of fees related to subscription downloadable mobile applications distributed through the Apple App and Google Play stores, as well as display advertisements.
Marketing
We market our Desktop applications to users primarily through digital display advertisements and paid search engine marketing efforts, as well as through a number of affiliate advertisers who engage in these efforts on our behalf. We market our mobile applications to users primarily through digital storefronts (primarily Apple App and Google Play stores) and digital display advertisements on social media, messaging and media platforms, as well as in-app and cross-app advertising.
Competition
The Applications industry is competitive and has no single, dominant desktop or mobile application brand globally. In the case of our Desktop business, we compete with a number of other companies that develop and market similar desktop browser application products and distribute them through direct to consumer and third-party agreements. We also compete with search engines to provide users with new tab, homepage and/or default search services. We believe that the ability of our Desktop business to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 

• | our ability to maintain industry-leading monetization solutions for our desktop browser applications in response to technological changes and platform demands;


• | the size and stability of our global base of installed desktop application products and our ability to grow this base;


• | the continued creation of desktop browser applications that resonate with consumers, which depends upon our continued ability to bundle attractive features, content and services (some of which may be owned by third parties);


• | our ability to differentiate our desktop browser applications from those of our competitors; and


• | our ability to market and distribute our desktop browser applications through direct to consumer (primarily the Chrome Web Store) and third-party channels in a cost-effective manner.

In the case of Mosaic Group, we compete with many mobile application companies that provide similar free and paid mobile application products. Our competition also comes from services provided by non-mobile, analog and disparate sources, along with certain digital companies whose competitive products are ancillary or immaterial to their primary sources of revenue. We believe that the ability of Mosaic Group to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 

• | the continued growth of consumer adoption of free and paid mobile applications generally and related engagement levels;


• | our ability to operate our mobile applications as a scalable platform;

• | our ability to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers in a cost-effective manner;


• | our ability to continue to optimize our marketing and monetization strategies;


• | the continued growth of smartphone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets;


• | the continued strength of Mosaic Group brands; and


• | our ability to introduce new and enhanced mobile applications in response to competitor offerings, consumer preferences, platform demands, social trends and evolving technological landscape.
