ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We believe we are the leading distributed gaming operator in the United States (“U.S.”) on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, and a preferred partner for local business owners in the markets we serve. Our business primarily consists of the installation, maintenance and operation of gaming terminals, redemption devices that disburse winnings and contain automated teller machine (“ATM”) functionality, and other amusement devices in authorized non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores, truck stops, and grocery stores. 
Our gaming-as-a-service platform provides local businesses with a turnkey, capital efficient gaming solution. We own all of our gaming equipment and manage the entire operating process for our location partners. We also offer our location partners gaming solutions that appeal to players who patronize those businesses. We devote significant resources to location partner retention, and seek to provide prompt, personalized player service and support, which we believe is unparalleled among other distributed gaming operators. Dedicated relationship managers assist location partners with regulatory applications and compliance onboarding, train location partners on how to engage with players and potential players, monitor individual gaming areas for compliance, cleanliness and comfort and recommend potential changes to improve both player gaming experience and overall revenue for each licensed establishment. We also provide weekly gaming revenue reports to our location partners and analyze and compare gaming results within individual licensed establishment partners. This information is used to determine an optimal selection of games, layouts and other ideas to generate foot traffic for ourlocation partners with the goal of generating increased gaming revenue. Further, our in-house collections and security personnel provide highly secure cash transportation and vault management services. Our best-in-class technicians ensure minimal downtime through proactive service and routine maintenance. 
In addition to our gaming business, we also install, operate and service redemption devices that have ATM functionality, stand-alone ATMs and amusement devices, including jukeboxes, dartboards, pool tables, and other related entertainment equipment. These operations provide a complementary source of lead generation for our gaming business by offering a “one-stop” source of additional equipment for our location partners. We are also a designer and manufacturer of gaming terminals and related equipment. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire other additional businesses, services, resources, or assets, including hospitality operations, that are accretive to our core gaming business.
Our Industry
We operate within the U.S. distributed gaming industry, which consists of the installation and service of gaming terminals at non-casino locations. Generally, a gaming terminal is any electronic video game machine that, upon insertion of cash, electronic cards or vouchers, or any combination thereof, is available to play or simulate the play of a video game, including but not limited to video poker and slots, and utilizes a video display and microprocessors in which players may receive free games or credits that can be redeemed for cash or merchandise. We believe that the distributed gaming industry is supported by generally favorable trends, including an increasing number of states contemplating approving gaming to increase tax revenues, broader acceptance in the U.S. of gaming generally, including online and digital gaming, an aging population that appreciates the convenience of gaming entertainment close to home, expected resilience through economic downturns and attractive revenue and return on invested capital profiles when compared to traditional gaming venues, such as casinos. We believe that the distributed gaming industry has witnessed both a growing player base and increased variety of higher quality and well-known game profiles available through gaming terminals.
States in Which We Operate
Illinois
Our operations are based primarily in Illinois. We have been licensed as a terminal operator in Illinois under the Illinois Gaming Act since 2012. We were one of the first terminal operators licensed in Illinois. According to the IGB, approximately 1,403 out of approximately 1,497 municipalities in Illinois permit the operation of gaming terminals. Gaming terminals in Illinois can be played in licensed bars, restaurants, gaming cafes, truck stops, fraternal organizations, veterans’ organizations, and other retail establishments, including some convenience stores, in areas accessible only to players who are 21 years of age or older. Gaming revenue in Illinois from gaming terminals generates significant tax revenue. The Illinois marginal tax rate on gaming is currently 34% and the remaining net terminal income is split evenly with the locations.
The IGB generally oversees gambling and video gaming operations in the state of Illinois. The Illinois Gaming Board (“IGB”) is authorized to issue licenses to distributed gaming operators and has broad disciplinary authority over Illinois’s distributed gaming industry which includes the power to fine operators and licensed establishments for non-compliance with IGB regulations. In addition, Illinois’ governor is empowered to appoint board members to the IGB and select its administrator. Not only do new appointments have the potential to change the composition of the IGB, they can impact current rules, regulations, policies and agendas of the IGB, which may result in increased enforcement measures or further delays in licensing new establishments. The IGB dictates the maximum bet, maximum win, and approves payout percentages for games played on gaming terminals which are required by regulation to exceed 80%. Generally, suppliers have designed gaming terminals to include between approximately 10 and 40 games. Illinois legislation allows licensed establishments to operate up to six gaming terminals, with certain qualifying truck stop licensed establishments allowed to operate up to ten gaming terminals. The maximum wager that may be placed on a gaming terminal is currently $4.00 and the maximum win from a single play is $1,199. All gaming terminals are monitored and controlled by the IGB through a central communications system. The IGB established minimum standards that licensed establishment partner contracts must meet, including limiting the length of contracts to a maximum of eight years with no automatic renewals.
Montana
We were granted a manufacturer, distributor and route operator license in June 2022 by the Gambling Control Division of the Montana Department of Justice through June 2023. The Montana license is perpetual, but is subject to an annual renewal fee. Distributed gaming in Montana is governed by the Montana Video Gaming Machine Control Act and is enforced by the Montana Department of Justice. Under Montana law, gaming operations are limited to business locations licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption only, with such locations restricted to offering a maximum of 20 slot machines. In Montana, the maximum bet is $2 and the maximum win from a single play is $800. Net terminal income is subject to a 15% state gaming tax and the remaining net terminal income splits with locations are individually negotiated. Our contracts with our locations may include incentives which may take the form of promotional participation or annual bonuses. In addition to our distributed gaming route operations in Montana, we also operate as a Class III video gaming machine manufacturer that is licensed in Montana, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Louisiana. We develop proprietary gaming terminals and related software for our distributed gaming routes in Montana and Nevada.
Nevada
 We were granted a two-year terminal operator license from the Nevada Gaming Commission (the “NGC”) in June 2022. This license will be up for renewal in June 2024. Distributed gaming in Nevada is governed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act and is enforced by the Gaming Control Board and the NGC. Nevada law limits distributed gaming operations (also known as “restricted gaming” operations) to certain types of non-casino locations, including grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, restaurants, bars, taverns and liquor stores, where gaming is incidental to the primary business being conducted at the location. Games are generally limited to 15 or fewer slot machines with no other forms of gaming activity permitted. The gaming area in bars and taverns typically requires the installation of slot machines into the physical bar (also known as “bar top” slot machines). In Nevada, there are no maximum bet limits and the max payout from a single spin must be less than $250,000. State and local 
government share of net terminal income is based on a fixed license fee, and the remaining net terminal income splits with locations are individually negotiated. Our contracts with our locations may include incentives, which may take the form of promotional participation or annual bonuses.
Georgia
One of our consolidated subsidiaries has a Class B Master License in the State of Georgia, which is required to operate coin-operated amusement machines (“COAMs”) in the state. The operation of COAMs in Georgia has been regulated by the Georgia Lottery Corporation (“GLC”) since April 2013. Class B COAMs provide skill-based games with winnings paid in points that may be redeemed for noncash merchandise, prizes, toys, gift cards, or novelties. The most common type of establishment licensees are convenience stores. Licensed establishments are limited to a maximum of nine machines, unless a municipality specifically limits licensed establishments to a maximum of six machines. In addition, any local governing authority may vote to remove coin operated amusement machines from its jurisdiction upon 60 days’ advance notice. Net terminal income is subject to a 10% state gaming tax and the remaining net terminal income is split evenly with the locations.
Nebraska
One of our consolidated subsidiaries was granted a Cash Device Distributor License by the Nebraska Department of Revenue on March 23, 2022. That license was renewed on December 8, 2022 for an annual term expiring on December 31, 2023. A cash device is any mechanical amusement device capable of awarding (a) cash, (b) anything redeemable for cash, or (c) gift cards, credit or other instruments that have a value denominated by reference to an amount of currency. We operate our cash devices in retail establishments throughout the state. A retail establishment includes any business location that is open to the public for the sale of goods other than cash devices and that possesses a valid sales tax permit. Currently, Nebraska does not tax net terminal income on cash devices. The net terminal income split with the retail establishments are individually negotiated. 
Iowa
One of our consolidated subsidiaries is a registered distributor in the State of Iowa, which is required to operate amusement concessions in the state. Amusement concessions are regulated by the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals (“IDIA”) under Title III, Chapter 99B of the Iowa Administrative Code. Amusement concessions fall into two broad categories: games of chance and games of skill. Games of chance are games in which the result is determined by chance. An example of a game of chance is when a player aligns objects or balls in a prescribed pattern in order to win. Certain establishments such as bars, taverns, and restaurants with a Class B or Class C liquor license are permitted to operate up to four electrical or mechanical games of chance. The total number of permitted electrical and mechanical games of chance allowed in Iowa is capped at 6,928 devices. Games of skill are games in which the result is determined by the player performing a task, such as directing or throwing objects to designated areas or targets, or by shooting a gun or rifle. We operate both games of chance and games of skill, as well as other amusement equipment and ATMs in Iowa. Cash and coin inserted into a game, or funds in, is subject to a 7% tax (of which 6% is a state tax and 1% is a local tax) and the net terminal income, less the tax, is split evenly with the location.
Pennsylvania
On November 28, 2022, we received a four-year Terminal Operator License in Pennsylvania under the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act. In November 2017, Pennsylvania’s Governor signed the Pennsylvania Gaming Act. The law authorized, among other forms of gaming, gaming terminals at qualified truck stops. To qualify for gaming, a truck stop must meet requirements that are similar to those in Illinois. We have a binding agreement to install gaming terminals with a partner truck stop establishment in Pennsylvania that has received a conditional license from the PA Board. We are also in discussions with other potential partners who have not yet applied for licensure. We hope to commence gaming operations in Pennsylvania in 2023. We believe the current total potential number of qualified trucks stops to host gaming terminals in Pennsylvania is approximately 100-150 truck stop establishments, although municipalities are able to individually opt out from authorizing distributed gaming. These establishments consist of individually-owned and corporate truck stops that meet current regulatory requirements for gaming terminal installation. 
Accel’s Strategic Core Competencies
We believe that the following strategic core competencies contribute to our industry leading position:
Gaming-as-a-service platform. When compared with traditional gaming businesses such as casinos, Accel believes its distributed gaming platform benefits from the following advantages:
•“business-to-business” model secured by long-term, exclusive contracts that are typically renewed, allowing for predictable, highly recurring revenue streams with low churn;
•operating a scalable business in fast-growing gaming segments that are primarily served by fragmented, sub-scale providers;
•state-of-the-art technology-enabled slot machines from leading manufacturers who provide the most captivating titles in slots entertainment;
•lower capital expenses and an asset-light operating model, in each case, when compared to casinos, which typically provide significantly higher capital-intensive offerings such as hotel accommodations, restaurants and stage-based entertainment;
•highly localized footprint that provides more access to gaming and convenience for consumers, as compared to regional casinos that market to players who may live up to several hours away and are thus prone to disruption of their feeder markets; and
•data reporting solutions and analytics, offering insight and advice to help location partners maximize revenues and ultimately grow their businesses;
•strong marketing, legal, compliance, cash management, financial and technical support systems, all of which remain in-house to boost efficiency and enhance the ability to serve as a premier gaming-as-a-service provider.
Strong relationships with location partners. Accel has prioritized establishing strong, lasting relationships with its location partners since its inception. Accel has a dedicated internal sales team and external independent sales agents that drive the sourcing of new gaming locations. When seeking to sign a new location, Accel’s marketing team employs a data-driven sales process to identify and nurture leads using a variety of digital and traditional strategies to drive organic gaming partnerships and preference. Accel engages with its locations through every step of the gaming terminal installation process. This process begins with providing assistance with preparation and submission of a license application to the applicable gaming regulatory board and educating each location on legal and regulatory topics to minimize compliance issues. Accel also assists in the design and construction of gaming areas at its locations. Accel dedicates a relationship manager to each of its locations, who, with support from other Accel personnel, oversees every aspect of partner relationship management and retention. Accel prides itself on providing prompt, reliable service and education, all of which helps to increase referral marketing by its partners. Accel’s relationship managers’ efforts to provide value-added services to their location partners result in consistent pre-renewals long before contracts expire and are a key element of our competitive differentiation that makes Accel a preferred partner of choice. Accel offers cash collection and analytics services for some of its locations to help ensure secure, fast and accurate collection of revenue for its locations. Additionally, Accel’s data team provides information to Accel's treasury department enabling it to deliver efficient, secure, and optimized collection services. These cash collection locations function as a key point of contact for our locations, and Accel believes that this service differentiates it from most of its competitors. Lastly, Accel's skilled technicians assist its locations in the event of any mechanical or software issues with the devices Accel provides. These technicians seek to prevent and solve technical issues with gaming terminals at locations in a timely manner. Accel’s experienced call center strives to solve service issues without the need to dispatch any technician. In the event a technician is required, most customer service issues are addressed the first time. 
Proven track record in executing and integrating acquisitions. Accel continuously evaluates and executes strategic acquisition opportunities. Accel has a successful track record of identifying, acquiring and integrating acquisitions and competitive operators. Accel believes that its industry reputation, scale, proven track record of driving revenue synergies, and access to financial capital enhances its ability to acquire other companies, operators or locations on favorable terms.
Diversified revenue base with limited churn. Accel believes that its distributed gaming operations facilitate a low revenue concentration per gaming location, and that its low-limit slots are more resilient to economic downturn as consumers typically continue to engage in locally convenient, lower cost forms of entertainment in such circumstances. While Accel experiences business disruptions each year due to business failures or natural disasters affecting gaming locations, many of these sites reopen in subsequent years under new owners. Accel believes it is best-positioned to reengage with those locations because of its reputation and leading market position. Accel’s gaming terminals are geographically diversified, limiting systemic risk due to local weather patterns or regional economic downturns. We believe that Accel’s recent expansion into Montana, Nevada, and Nebraska and future expansion into other states will further help to further diversify its distributed gaming portfolio.
Deep industry and vendor relationships. Accel’s leading market position has led to strong relationships within its industry and with equipment suppliers. Accel has successfully integrated multiple other operators and believes this successful roll-up strategy positions it well with potential additional local operators who could benefit from Accel’s gaming-as-a-service platform. In addition, Accel’s industry leadership permits it to seek and obtain favorable pricing and supply of key gaming machines. Due to its ability to procure machines and parts easily, Accel is able to rotate machines quickly to gaming locations where they are best utilized within its operating footprint. Accel believes that by providing premium, high-quality equipment, it gives its location partners a competitive advantage by limiting downtime to maximize revenue and player retention. This results in longer, more effective usage and greater lifetimes for Accel’s gaming terminals.
Digital and data analytics team that helps location partners capture gaming revenue. Accel’s digital and data analytics team studies the gaming terminal market and location performance to provide insight and advice to maximize gaming revenue. The team actively monitors machine optimization, service analytics, game popularity analytics, marketing and player behavior to identify new opportunities and provide insights to maximize gaming revenues. Typical suggestions might involve adding new games, switching machines, adding machines or changing machine location within a location. The digital and data analytics team also seeks to improve the quality of customer service and satisfaction by monitoring service calls to identify trends and solutions with the goal of optimizing response time to decrease periods of machine downtime.
Dedicated marketing, legal and compliance function that assists location partners to remain in regulatory compliance. Accel's marketing and sales efforts are subject to the rules and regulations of the regulatory gaming bodies and municipal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we do business. These rules generally require sales agent registration, include prohibitions related to inducements and restrict certain advertising and promotional activities. Accel’s legal and compliance team provides support and resources related to location regulatory compliance, which includes sending compliance reminders and industry updates to location partners on a regular basis. It does not dispense legal advice to location partners, but may recommend that location partners obtain legal counsel in certain instances. In addition, the legal and compliance team occasionally participates in lobbying measures, which includes working with gaming regulators and trade associations to encourage legislation and regulation that may be favorable to the distributed gaming industry. Accel also regularly works with regulators in other states as they explore the legalization of gaming terminals.
Management team. Accel’s executive management team has many years of experience and industry knowledge. Accel’s President, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Andy Rubenstein, has led the Company since its inception in 2009, and its other executive officers have approximately 65 years of combined gaming industry experience. When Accel acquired Century in 2022, Accel added an experienced management team that has been in the distributed gaming business since 1989. Accel believes that its industry-leading management team has a reputation for integrity and compelling customer service.
Accel’s Growth Opportunities
Accel’s key growth strategies include its plans to:
Grow in current markets both organically and inorganically
We believe that there is potential for further growth in the markets we serve. We have been successful in the past growing organically by signing competitors’ locations and continue to identify prospects for engagement after current contracts with other partners expire. We also strive to further optimize revenues for gaming terminals we currently operate through refined data analysis, marketing and other initiatives. We seek to increase distribution possibilities through corporate partners who operate multiple locations, such as chain stores. We believe that these corporate businesses tend to favor larger operators who have substantial compliance infrastructures in addition to leading service capabilities. While such locations have been “second movers” in choosing to adopt video gaming, partnering with reputable operators such as Accel could render deployment of gaming terminals more attractive. Our ability to succeed in implementing our growth strategy will depend to some degree upon our ability to grow inorganically. As such, we continue to pursue expansion and acquisition opportunities in gaming and related businesses. We may also realize the benefits of potential municipal ordinance changes that would permit our business to operate in new municipalities.
Expand into new states that allow distributed gaming that we do not operate in. Accel is evaluating whether to expand its gaming operations through strategic acquisitions or otherwise in other, more mature gaming jurisdictions where gaming terminals are currently legal, such as Louisiana, Oregon, South Dakota and West Virginia. Accel may seek approval to operate in these states and Accel believes it would be a favored entrant into any such states given its track record of success and compliance in the states in which it currently operates.
Expand into new states that are considering distributed gaming. Various states and other jurisdictions have proposed legislation permitting gaming terminals or other forms of gaming in the past. These states include Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wyoming. Accel believes it would be a favored entrant into any such states given its track record of success and compliance in the states in which it currently operates..
Expand player rewards program to further drive growth. As part of its gaming-as-a-service suite of offerings, Accel is considering offering a player rewards program for players in Illinois. The anticipated terms of the program will provide for players to accumulate points each time they use Accel’s products and may provide points that can be redeemed for rewards. Accel believes this program will result in increased brand loyalty from licensed establishment partners by rewarding players for using Accel’s gaming terminals. Although player rewards programs are permitted under the Illinois Gaming Act, applicable regulations have not been enacted, and the IGB has not approved any player rewards programs for any terminal operator. Accel has not applied to the IGB to establish any such program, but expects to apply in the event of applicable regulation enactment. Century has an established proprietary player reward and tracking system. In Montana, the system is called iRewards and, in the Nevada market, it is called Gambler's Bonus Cash for Play. Both programs work similarly in that they track the player's activity and award points based on that play. Both are a cardless system that allows the players to log on directly to the system at the gaming terminal. Once logged in, the player can redeem accumulated points immediately and interact with bonus games awarded by the respective system. Players may get promoted to higher levels of rewards based on their annual play. These higher levels allow the player to earn more points per play, increase their daily redemption amount, and be eligible for certain promotions associate with their level. 
Expand ancillary service offerings to our locations. While distributing and servicing amusement devices such as jukeboxes, dartboards, pool tables, and other ancillary equipment, such as redemption devices and stand-alone ATMs, is not the primary focus of our business, Accel believes that these services provide a key point for ongoing customer contact and enhances its image as a “one-stop shop” for entertainment devices. Accel has observed that our locations appreciate these services and continue to rely on Accel to provide them. Providing these services can also serve as a point of initial contact with potential partners who may decide to avail themselves later of Accel’s primary gaming services. As a result, Accel 
intends to continue prioritizing the installation of these devices and equipment. Accel may consider adding hospitality and related services to support its distributed gaming businesses as allowed in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Suppliers
Accel installs cutting-edge software and multi-game gaming terminals, at each location, from leading manufacturers such as Light & Wonder, Inc.(formerly known as Scientific Games International), WMS (owned by Light & Wonder, Inc.), IGT, Bally (owned by Light & Wonder, Inc.), Aristocrat and Novomatic. Under agreements with these manufacturers, Accel is able to provide 32 different types of gaming terminal models and 288 different games to its location partners. Accel believes its efforts to procure gaming terminals from various sources better enables it to meet the needs of location partners and players.
Accel purchases gaming terminals in upright, slant and bar-top varieties, as well as designs and manufactures gaming terminals. Games include different varieties of slots, poker, and keno games. Accel routinely meets with existing and potential manufacturers in the market to discuss performance, service trends, and feedback from location partners and players. Accel purchases gaming terminals from certain suppliers under master purchase agreements and purchase orders. Under these master purchase agreements with certain suppliers, pricing is determined by quantities purchased for delivery over defined periods. Accel generally pays its suppliers within 90 days after the date of invoice.
Accel also purchases redemption devices, amusement devices and stand-alone ATMs from reputable suppliers such as NRT, Touch Tunes, Arachnid, and Diamond.
Competition
Accel competes on the basis of the responsiveness of its services to players, and the popularity, content, features, quality, functionality, accuracy and reliability of its products. In markets with regulated net terminal income splits, Accel generally does not consider pricing to be a factor in our distributed gaming business as all minimum and maximum wagers are mandated by the applicable governing bodies and revenue splits with our locations are regulated by law. Accel believes most of these locations focus on player appeal, customer service and reputation when making their decisions to collaborate with terminal operators in these regulated markets. In markets with negotiated net terminal income splits, Accel believes pricing is a key driver as all revenue splits are negotiated. Accel's focus on player appeal, customer service and reputation are also key factors impacting competition in markets with negotiated net terminal income splits.
Accel faces particularly robust competition from other forms of gaming. The distributed gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants on both a local and national level, including casinos, Internet gaming, sports betting, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, horse racetracks (including those featuring slot machines and/or table games), fantasy sports, real money iGaming, and other forms of gaming. In addition, Internet-based lotteries, sweepstakes, and fantasy sports, and Internet-based or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play casino games from home or in non-casino settings and could divert players from using Accel’s products in its locations. Even Internet wagering services that may be illegal under federal and state law but operate from overseas locations, may nevertheless sometimes be accessible to domestic gamblers and divert players from visiting location partners to play on Accel’s gaming terminals.
The availability of other forms of gaming could increase substantially in the future. Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional sources of tax revenue by authorizing or expanding gaming. In addition, jurisdictions are considering or have already recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming, and there are proposals across the country that would legalize Internet poker and other varieties of Internet gaming in a number of states and at the federal level. Established gaming jurisdictions could also award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations, including gaming terminals. While Accel believes it is well positioned to take advantage of certain of these opportunities, expansion of gaming in other jurisdictions, both legal and illegal, could further compete with its gaming terminals.
In addition to competition from other forms of gaming and entertainment and the expansion thereof, Accel’s business faces significant competition from suppliers and other terminal operators, stand-alone ATMs, jukeboxes, dartboards, pool tables, and 
other related entertainment machines. Accel’s operations also face competition from many forms of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts, and travel.
Intellectual Property
Accel owns or has rights to use the trademarks, service marks or trade names that it uses or will use in conjunction with the operation of its business. In the highly competitive gaming industry, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are important to the success of its business.
As of December 31, 2022, Accel owned 125 registered trademarks and 126 registered domain names. Accel also relies on software or technologies that it licenses from third parties. These licenses may not continue to be available to Accel on commercially reasonable terms in the future and as a result, Accel may be required to obtain substitute software or technologies.
Seasonality 
Accel’s results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. For example, our operations in colder climates typically experience lower revenues in the summer when players typically spend less time indoors, and higher revenues in cold weather, specifically between February and April, when players will typically spend more time indoors. Holidays, vacation seasons and sporting events may also cause Accel’s revenues to fluctuate in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Human Capital Resources
Accel believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high-quality workforce is critical to our long-term success. Our board of directors is charged with oversight of human capital management. We strive to promote a welcoming workplace that fosters partnership with location owners and encourage our employees to bring their best ideas to work every day. As of December 31, 2022, Accel employs approximately 1,300 people nationwide, and protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our employees is a top priority. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment and continue to have zero tolerance for unsafe work conditions for our frontline employees who continue to move, support and sell our products and services.
Accel’s human capital management focuses on the following priorities:
Talent Recruitment and Management 
Accel seeks to provide employees with rewarding work, professional growth and educational opportunities. We place an emphasis on training and development for all levels of our workforce to ensure that people of every background have the tools to reach their full potential. All new employees participate in a structured on-boarding experience to provide broad exposure and understanding of all parts of the business and organization before starting their functional training. Formal new hire training ranges from 2 weeks to 6 months, depending on the employee's job function. We utilize continuous coaching conversations that we believe helps all employees and managers work more effectively together. For further growth and development of our workforce, we broadly make available skill training and development to increase individual productivity. We also offer employee development programs and training opportunities, including our:
•Executive Development Program: This program focuses on accelerating the leadership development of high-potential employees while they remain in their current roles. The goal of this program is to prepare the participants for promotion or a strategic lateral movement within 12 months of graduation.
•Employee Development Program: This program focuses on creating opportunity and exposure for a broader cross-functional team, while they also remain in their current roles. In this program, individuals focus on individual development and team engagement. 
Compensation and benefits programs
Accel provides compensation and benefits programs designed to support our employees’ health, wealth and life. We seek to provide comprehensive, competitive and equitable pay and benefits to our employees. Our initiatives in this area include offering the following:
•Comprehensive benefits program that provides our employees and their families with the flexibility to choose their preferred medical, dental and vision plans. Our benefits program is designed to help keep our employees and their families healthy and provide important protection in the event of illness or injury.
•Annual company bonus initiative that is applicable to all eligible employees. The program is focused on rewarding employees for company performance and the contributions that each employee has in delivering those results. 
•Paid time off program that balances the needs of our employee population and offers wellness days to supplement our national paid holiday schedule.
•401(k) company match program supports our employees to achieve their financial goals. 
•Employee assistance program that provides free and confidential counseling to all employees and their families.
•Military leave benefits that support employees whose family members are on active duty or who need to care for a service member.
•Support for our employees’ health and wellness goals through free access to our full-scale gym at our headquarters office.
•ACES, a peer-to-peer employee recognition program, rewards individuals who exceed expectations and consistently demonstrate Accel's core values. 
Culture
Each employee shapes Accel’s culture through behaviors and practices. We ask everyone to lead with our core values and behave according to our Code of Conduct. Our Code of Conduct features the fundamental behaviors that help anchor, inform and guide us and applies to all employees. 
Our core values and Code of Conduct are aligned with our deep commitment to partnerships with local business owners and our goal of always delivering the best service to our customers and an entertaining experience for our players.
Accel is an equal opportunity employer.
