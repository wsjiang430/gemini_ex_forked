 ITEM 1. BUSINESS



Overview



We are a clinical-stage, precision medicine pharmaceutical company actively advancing a pipeline of in-licensed oncology therapeutics for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. Our clinical program includes three anti-cancer assets in mid-stage clinical development and one anti-cancer asset in early-stage clinical development. Our programs and partnerships leverage our proprietary, highly accurate Drug Response Predictor (DRP®) technology to refine patient selection and improve clinical outcomes. Our DRP® technology has been broadly validated across an extensive array of therapies and tumor types with a high degree of accuracy for matching the right patient to the right drug. By identifying those patients who will and who will not respond, the DRP® companion diagnostics have the potential to transform cancer therapeutic development across many indications by increasing clinical success rates with trials involving a fewer number of patients and improve patient outcomes by matching them to the right drug.



Our pipeline currently consists of three mid-stage clinical candidates for cancer and one anti-cancer asset in early-stage clinical development. We are focused on the clinical development of three priority programs: dovitinib in combination with stenoparib for the second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer, stenoparib as a monotherapy for ovarian cancer, and IXEMPRA® as a monotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. In addition, Allarity is supporting the development of one additional clinical asset through business development activities. Each Allarity pipeline program is being co-developed with a drug specific DRP® companion diagnostic to select and treat patients most likely to benefit from treatment.



While we have not yet successfully received regulatory or marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates or companion diagnostics, and while we believe that our approach has the potential to reduce the cost and time of drug development through the identification and selection of patient populations more likely to respond to therapy, our strategy involves risks and uncertainties that differ from other biotechnology companies that focus solely on new therapeutic candidates that do not have a history of failed clinical development. By utilizing our DRP® platform to generate a drug-specific companion diagnostic for each of our therapeutic candidates, if approved by the FDA, we believe our therapeutic candidates have the potential to advance the goal of personalized medicine by selecting the patients most likely to benefit from each of our therapeutic candidates and avoid the treatment of non-responder patients. All of our therapeutic candidates are clinical stage assets and the FDA has not yet approved any of our therapeutic candidates or any of our DRP® companion diagnostics. As used in this report, statements regarding the use of our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics or our proprietary DRP® platform or our observations that a therapeutic candidate may have anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity or is observed to be well tolerated in a patient population should not be construed to mean that we have resolved all issues of safety and/or efficacy for any of our therapeutic candidates or DRP® companion diagnostic. Issues of safety and efficacy for any therapeutic candidate or companion diagnostic may only be determined by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.



Our clinical and commercial development team is advancing our pipeline of targeted oncology therapeutic candidates, all of which have previously succeeded at least through Phase 1 clinical trials demonstrating that the therapeutic candidate is well tolerated. Our three priority assets, dovitinib, stenoparib, and IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone) are all former drug candidates of large pharmaceutical companies.



Our most advanced therapeutic candidate, dovitinib, is a selective inhibitor of several classes of tyrosine kinases, including FGFR and VEGFR, and was formerly developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals through Phase 3 clinical trials in numerous indications. We submitted an NDA with the FDA on December 21, 2021, for the third line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC or kidney cancer) in patients selected by our Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Prior to submission of the NDA, we submitted a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application to the FDA for approval of our dovitinib-specific DRP® companion diagnostic for use to select and treat patients likely to respond to dovitinib. On February 15, 2022, we received Refusal to File (RTF) letters for both our dovitinib NDA and our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic PMA. The FDA has asserted that neither our NDA or PMA meets the regulatory requirements to warrant a complete agency review. The primary grounds of rejection asserted by the FDA relates to our use of prior Phase 3 clinical trial data, generated by Novartis in a “superiority” endpoint study against sorafenib (Bayer), to support a “non-inferiority” endpoint and superiority in connection with the DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic. Based upon the reasons given in the RTF letters and a subsequent Type C meeting with the FDA on May 31, 2022, we anticipate that the FDA will require a prospective Phase 3 clinical trial as well as additional dose optimization studies before regulatory approval of Dovitinib as a monotherapy and its companion diagnostic Dovitinib-DRP for the treatment of third-line mRCC can be obtained. While we have decided that the costs, risks and potential benefits of conducting these studies for dovitinib as a monotherapy for mRCC are no longer the best path toward commercial success, we continue to evaluate other potential Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for dovitinib combined with other approved drugs in the mRCC space and in other indications. For example, subject to funding we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors. Our decision to advance dovitinib as a combination therapy and not as a monotherapy is based on our belief that both the science and the market for oncology therapies has shifted towards combination therapies and away from monotherapies for multiple indications of cancer. We further believe that our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic is tumor agnostic and our retrospective analysis of the clinical data generated in the Novartis clinical studies for mRCC will also support a companion diagnostic for dovitinib in second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer, as well as other indications.

Our second priority therapeutic candidate is stenoparib (formerly E7449), a novel inhibitor of the key DNA damage repair enzyme poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which also has an observed inhibitory action against Tankyrases, another important group of DNA damage repair enzymes. Stenoparib was formerly developed by Eisai, Inc. (Eisai) through Phase 1 clinical trials, and we are currently advancing a Phase 2 clinical trial of this therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ovarian cancer at trial sites in the U.S. and Europe together with its stenoparib-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, for which the FDA has previously approved an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. In addition, subject to funding, we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors.



Our third priority therapeutic candidate is IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone), a selective microtubule inhibitor, which has been shown to interfere with cancer cell division, leading to cell death. IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone) was formerly developed and brought to market by Bristol-Myers Squibb, is currently marketed and sold in the U.S. by R-PHARM US LLC, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer treated with two or more prior chemotherapies. We are currently advancing IXEMPRA®, together with its drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, in a Phase 2 European clinical trial for the same indication, with the goal of eventually submitting an application for Marketing Authorization (MA) with the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to market IXEMPRA®, together with its drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, in the European market.



We have in-licensed the intellectual property rights to develop, use and market our two most advanced therapeutic candidates, dovitinib and stenoparib. Consequently, we must perform all of the obligations under these license agreements, including the payment of substantial development milestones payments and royalty payments on future sales in the event we receive marketing approval for dovitinib or stenoparib in the future. If we fail to perform our obligations under our license agreements, we may lose the intellectual property rights to these therapeutic candidates which will have a material adverse effect on our business.



Our focused approach to address major unmet needs in oncology leverages our management’s expertise in discovery, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development, and commercialization. As a result, we have created substantial intellectual property around the composition of matter for our new chemical entities. The foundations of our approach include:




● | The pursuit of clinical-stage assets: We strive to identify and pursue novel oncology therapeutic candidates that have advanced beyond Phase 1 clinical trials and are preferably Phase 2 to Phase 3 clinical stage assets. Accordingly, the assets we have acquired, and intend to acquire, have undergone prior clinical trials by other pharmaceutical companies with clinical data that helps us evaluate whether these candidates will be well tolerated in the tested patient population, and in some cases, have observed anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity that would support additional clinical trials using our DRP® platform. We often focus our acquisition efforts on therapeutic candidates that have been the subject of clinical trials conducted by large pharmaceutical companies. Further we intend to select therapeutic candidates for which we believe we can develop a drug-specific DRP® to advance together with the therapeutic candidate in further clinical trials as a companion diagnostic to select and treat the patients most likely to respond to the therapeutic candidate. We further consider whether the licensor or assignor can provide us substantial clinical grade active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for the therapeutic candidate, at low-to-no cost, for our use in future clinical trials. The availability of API at low-to-no cost reduces both our future clinical trial costs and the lead time it takes us to start a new clinical trial for the therapeutic candidate. As an example, our therapeutic candidate, dovitinib, was developed by Novartis through Phase 2 clinical trials in numerous indications and in Phase 3 clinical trials for RCC before we acquired the therapeutic candidate, and it came with a substantial API.

● | Our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics: We believe our proprietary and patented Drug Response Predictor (DRP®) platform provides us with a substantial clinical and commercial competitive advantage for each of the therapeutic candidates in our pipeline. Our DRP® companion diagnostic platform is a proprietary, predictive biomarker technology that employs complex systems biology, bio-analytics with a proprietary clinical relevance filter to bridge the gap between in vitro cancer cell responsiveness to a given therapeutic candidate and in vivo likelihood of actual patient response to that therapeutic candidate. The DRP® companion diagnostic platform has been retrospectively validated by us using retrospective observational studies in 35 clinical trials that were conducted or sponsored by other companies. We intend to develop and validate a drug-specific DRP® biomarker for each and every therapeutic candidate in our therapeutic candidate pipeline to serve as a companion diagnostic to select and treat patients most likely to respond to that therapeutic candidate. Although we are in the early stages of our companion diagnostic development and have not yet received a PMA from the FDA, our DRP® technology has been peer-reviewed by numerous publications and we have patented our DRP® platform for more than 70 anti-cancer drugs. While retrospective studies guide our clinical development of our companion diagnostics, prospective clinical trials may be required in order to receive a PMA from the FDA.

● | A precision oncology approach: Our focused strategy is to advance our pipeline of therapeutic candidates, together with DRP® companion diagnostics, to bring these therapeutic candidates, once approved, to market and to patients through a precision oncology approach. Our DRP® companion diagnostic platform provides a gene expression fingerprint that we believe reveals whether a specific tumor in a specific patient is likely to respond to one of our therapeutic candidates and therefore can be used to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to a particular therapeutic treatment in order to guide therapy decisions and lead to better treatment outcomes. We believe our DRP® companion diagnostic platform may be used both to identify a susceptible patient population for inclusion in clinical trials during the drug development process (and to exclude the non-susceptible patient population), and further to select the optimal anti-cancer drug for individual patients in the treatment setting once an anti-cancer drug is approved and marketed. By including only patients that have tumors that we believe may respond to our therapeutic candidate in our clinical trials, we believe our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics platform has the potential to improve the overall treatment response in our clinical trials and thereby improving our chances for regulatory approval to market our therapeutic candidate, while potentially reducing the time, cost, and risk of clinical development.

The following chart summarizes our therapeutic candidate pipeline:


Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” which would allow us to continue to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including presenting only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.

Overview



We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company targeting some of the greatest unmet needs in oncology by developing differentiated and novel therapeutic candidates together with our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics in a precision medicine approach. Our business strategy includes a focus on leveraging our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics platform to streamline the drug development process and to identify patients that will benefit from therapeutic candidates that other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies have abandoned or shelved after initiating clinical trials under an IND application filed with the FDA, including candidates that have failed to achieve statistical significance on the original endpoints established in their clinical trials. We use our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics platform to advance therapeutic candidates by targeting and evaluating patient sub-populations having gene signatures, determined by our DRP® companion diagnostics platform, that will potentially correlate with drug efficacy and patient response to treatment. While we have not yet successfully received regulatory or marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates or companion diagnostics, and while we believe that our approach has the potential to reduce the cost and time of drug development through the identification and selection of patient populations more likely to respond to therapy, our strategy involves risks and uncertainties that differ from other biotechnology companies that focus solely on new therapeutic candidates that do not have a history of failed clinical development.

See “BUSINESS - Recapitalization Share Exchange, Asset Acquisition and Financing.” Concurrently, on December 21, 2021, we completed a private placement of our Series A Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase additional shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million.
Our Business



Our DRP® companion diagnostic platform has been retrospectively validated by us using retrospective observational studies in 35 clinical trials that were conducted or sponsored by other companies. The FDA considers a retrospective observational study to be one in which the study identifies the population and determines the exposure/treatment from historical data (i.e. data generated prior to the initiation of the study) with the variables and outcomes of interest determined at the time the study is designed. See, Framework for FDA’s Real-World Evidence Program, page 6 (December 2018), https://www.fda.gov/media/120060/download. The FDA has accepted our retrospective validation in support of two Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) applications to conduct clinical trials, one with respect to LiPlaCis® and one with respect to stenoparib. However, while retrospective studies guide our clinical development of our companion diagnostics, prospective clinical trials may be required in order to receive a PMA from the FDA.



We submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our therapeutic candidate, dovitinib, a second-generation “pan”-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), on December 21, 2021, for the third line treatment of mRCC in patients selected by our Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Subsequently the FDA determined that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and therefore or NDA was not accepted for filing. The primary grounds of rejection asserted by the FDA relates to our use of prior Phase 3 clinical trial data, generated by Novartis in a “superiority” endpoint study against sorafenib (Bayer), to support a “non-inferiority” endpoint in connection with the DRP® Dovitinib companion diagnostic. We anticipate that the FDA will require a prospective Phase 3 clinical trial as well as additional dosage studies before regulatory approval of Dovitinib as a monotherapy and its companion diagnostic Dovitinib-DRP can be obtained. While we have decided that the costs, risks and potential benefits of conducting these studies for dovitinib as a monotherapy for mRCC are no longer the best path toward commercial success, we continue to evaluate other potential Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for dovitinib combined with other approved drugs in the mRCC space and in other indications. For example, subject to funding we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors. Our decision to advance dovitinib as a combination therapy and not as a monotherapy is based on our belief that both the science and the market for oncology therapies has shifted towards combination therapies and away from monotherapies for multiple indications of cancer. We further believe that our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic is tumor agnostic and our retrospective analysis of the clinical data generated in the Novartis clinical studies for mRCC will also support a companion diagnostic for dovitinib in second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer, as well as other indications.



While we have suffered delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to expand patient enrollment in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials for our two other priority programs, stenoparib, a novel inhibitor of the key DNA damage repair enzyme poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone), a selective microtubule inhibitor. We also intend to opportunistically acquire other promising oncology assets, which have undergone prior clinical trials by other pharmaceutical companies with clinical data that helps us evaluate whether these candidates will be well tolerated in the tested patient population, and in some cases, have observed anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity that would support additional clinical trials using our DRP® platform.

Our clinical and commercial development team is advancing our pipeline of targeted oncology therapeutic candidates, all of which have previously succeeded at least through Phase 1 clinical demonstrating that the therapeutic candidate is well tolerated. Our three priority assets, dovitinib, stenoparib, and IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone) are all former drug candidates of large pharmaceutical companies.



Our most advanced therapeutic candidate, dovitinib, is a selective inhibitor of several classes of tyrosine kinases, including FGFR and VEGFR, and was formerly developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals through Phase 3 clinical trials in numerous indications. As mentioned above, we submitted an NDA with the FDA on December 21, 2021, for the third line treatment of mRCC in patients selected by our Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Prior to submission of the NDA, we submitted a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application to the FDA for approval of our dovitinib-specific DRP® companion diagnostic for use to select and treat patients likely to respond to dovitinib. On February 15, 2022, we received RTF letters for both our dovitinib NDA and our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic PMA. The FDA has asserted that neither our NDA or PMA meets the regulatory requirements to warrant a complete agency review. The primary grounds of rejection asserted by the FDA relates to our use of prior Phase 3 clinical trial data, generated by Novartis in a “superiority” endpoint study against sorafenib (Bayer), to support a “non-inferiority” endpoint and superiority in connection with the DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic. We anticipate that it will be necessary to conduct a new prospective Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as additional dosing studies, to gain approval of dovitinib in the U.S. as a monotherapy for mRCC. While we have decided that the costs, risks and potential benefits of conducting these studies for dovitinib as a monotherapy for mRCC are no longer the best path toward commercial success, we continue to evaluate other potential Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for dovitinib combined with other approved drugs in the mRCC space and in other indications. For example, subject to funding we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors.

We further believe that our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic is tumor agnostic and our retrospective analysis of the clinical data generated in the Novartis clinical studies for mRCC will also support a companion diagnostic for dovitinib in second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer, as well as other indications.



Our second priority therapeutic candidate is stenoparib (formerly E7449), a novel inhibitor of the key DNA damage repair enzyme poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which also has an observed inhibitory action against Tankyrases, another important group of DNA damage repair enzymes. Stenoparib was formerly developed by Eisai, Inc. (Eisai) through Phase 1 clinical trials, and we are currently advancing a Phase 2 clinical trial of this therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ovarian cancer at trial sites in the U.S. and Europe) together with its stenoparib-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, for which the FDA has previously approved an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. As mentioned above, subject to funding we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors.



Our third priority therapeutic candidate is IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone), a selective microtubule inhibitor, which has been shown to interfere with cancer cell division, leading to cell death. IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone) was formerly developed and brought to market by Bristol-Myers Squibb, is currently marketed and sold in the U.S. by R-PHARM US LLC, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer treated with two or more prior chemotherapies. We are currently advancing IXEMPRA®, together with its drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, in a Phase 2 European clinical trial for the same indication, with the goal of eventually submitting an application for Marketing Authorization (MA) with the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to market IXEMPRA®, together with its drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, in the European market.



We have in-licensed the intellectual property rights to develop, use and market our two lead therapeutic candidates, dovitinib and stenoparib. Consequently, we must perform all of the obligations under these license agreements, including the payment of substantial development milestones payments and royalty payments on future sales in the event we receive marketing approval for dovitinib or stenoparib in the future. If we fail to perform our obligations under our license agreements, we may lose the intellectual property rights to these therapeutic candidates which will have a material adverse effect on our business.

As a result, we have created substantial intellectual property around the composition of matter for our new chemical entities. The foundations of our approach include:




● | The pursuit of clinical-stage assets: We strive to identify and pursue novel oncology therapeutic candidates that have advanced beyond Phase 1 clinical trials and are preferably Phase 2 to Phase 3 clinical stage assets.

We further consider whether the licensor or assignor can provide us substantial clinical grade active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for the therapeutic candidate, at low-to-no cost, for our use in future clinical trials. The availability of API at low-to-no cost reduces both our future clinical trial costs and the lead time it takes us to start a new clinical trial for the therapeutic candidate. As an example, our therapeutic candidate, dovitinib, was developed by Novartis through Phase 2 clinical trials in numerous indications and in Phase 3 clinical trials for RCC before we acquired the therapeutic candidate, and it came with a substantial API.

The following chart summarizes our therapeutic candidate pipeline:


Recapitalization Share Exchange, Asset Acquisition and Financing



We were previously known as Oncology Venture A/S and changed our name to Allarity Therapeutics A/S on October 7, 2020. On April 6, 2021, we incorporated Allarity Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the purposes of undertaking a recapitalization share exchange, a private placement of our preferred stock with an institutional investor (the “PIPE Financing”), and migrating the trading in our shares from the Nasdaq First North Growth Market: Stockholm to Nasdaq in the U.S. On May 20, 2021, we entered into a Plan of Reorganization and Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Recapitalization Share Exchange”), which was amended and restated on September 23, 2021, between us, Allarity Acquisition Subsidiary, our wholly owned Delaware subsidiary (“Acquisition Sub”), and Allarity Therapeutics A/S, an Aktieselskab organized under the laws of Denmark (“Allarity Therapeutics A/S, or Allarity A/S”), subject to the approval of the Recapitalization Share Exchange at an Extraordinary General Meeting (the “EGM”) of the shareholders of Allarity A/S. The shareholders of Allarity A/S approved the Recapitalization Share Exchange at the EGM on November 22, 2021. On December 17, 2021 and in connection with the Recapitalization Share Exchange, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with our Acquisition Sub and Allarity A/S, pursuant to which Allarity A/S agreed to sell, and our Acquisition Sub agreed to purchase, all of Allarity A/S’ assets and certain specified liabilities in connection with Allarity A/S’ Business (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement), for an aggregate purchase price of 8,075,824 shares of our common stock, plus the assumption of the specified liabilities.



On December 20, 2021, we consummated the transactions contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which our Acquisition Sub acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Allarity A/S. In connection with the closing, our Acquisition Sub acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Allarity A/S in exchange for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (SEC File No. 333-258968), which was declared effective on November 5, 2021. Upon the closing of the Recapitalization Share Exchange, all of the shareholders of Allarity A/S became our shareholders, owning substantially the same percentage ownership in us as they owned in Allarity A/S. All of the business previously owned by Allarity A/S is owned and conducted by us through our Acquisition Sub.



Because we were formed as a “business combination related shell company” as defined in SEC Rule 405 for the purposes of undertaking our Recapitalization Share Exchange, Allarity Therapeutics A/S, our former parent who became our predecessor upon consummation of the Recapitalization Share Exchange, was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Recapitalization Share Exchange. While we are the legal acquirer of Allarity Therapeutics A/S in the Recapitalization Share Exchange, because Allarity Therapeutics A/S is deemed to be the accounting acquirer, the historical consolidated financial statements of Allarity Therapeutics A/S became our historical consolidated financial statements upon the consummation of the Recapitalization Share Exchange.

The Private Placement (PIPE Financing)



Concurrently with the execution of the Recapitalization Share Exchange on May 20, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) and related agreements with an institutional investor (the “Investor”) wherein we agreed to sell, and the Investor agreed to purchase, 20,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase additional shares of our common stock (the “PIPE Warrant”) for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million with a closing conditioned upon the consummation of our Recapitalization Share Exchange and a listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. Simultaneously with the execution of the SPA, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (“RRA”) with the Investor wherein we agreed to register a number of shares of our common stock equal to the maximum number of shares of our common stock that could be issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock using a conversion price equal to 20% of $80,000,000 divided by the number of shares of common stock then outstanding (the “Floor Price”) price plus 125% of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the PIPE Warrant, or a maximum of 12,618,590 shares of our common stock. Such shares were registered for resale on a Registration Statement on Form S-1 originally filed with the SEC on September 13, 2021 (SEC File No. 333-259484), which was declared effective on December 20, 2021. Under the terms of the RRA, if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement beyond defined allowable grace periods set forth in the RRA, we will incur certain registration delay payments equal to 2% of the Investor’s investment upon our failure to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement and every 30 days thereafter. Failure to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement also constitutes a “triggering event” under the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock that would result in the accrual and payment of a dividend and provide the Investor the right to have its remaining Series A Preferred Stock redeemed for a premium of a minimum of 125% of the Conversion Amount of the Series A Preferred Stock, as more specifically described below.



Simultaneously with the closing of its Recapitalization Share Exchange, we closed on the PIPE Investment pursuant to the SPA. On December 20, 2021, we issued 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share and a common stock purchase warrant to purchase 2,018,958 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $9.9061 to the Investor for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock has a right to convert into shares of our common stock at an initial fixed conversion price of $9.9061. However, if (i) the price of our shares of common stock trade below $9.9061 (a “Price Failure”) for a specified period of time; or (ii) in the event that the sum of (x) the aggregate daily dollar trading volume (as reported on Bloomberg) of our common stock on Nasdaq during the 10 trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding such date of determination, divided by (y) 10, is less than $1,500,000 (a “Volume Maximum Failure”), each share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to convert at a price equal to 90% of the sum of the two lowest VWAPs during the ten (10) trading day period immediately preceding delivery divided by two (the “90% Conversion Price”), but not less than the Floor Price, or, at the time of such Price Failure or Volume Maximum Failure, the sum of the average daily U.S. Dollar volume for our common stock during the 10 days previous to conversion divided by 10 is less than $2,000,000 (a “Volume Alternate Failure”), then each share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to convert at the lower of the fixed conversion price or a price equal to 80% of the sum of the two lowest VWAPs during the 10 trading day period immediately preceding delivery divided by two (the “80% Conversion Price”), but not less than the Floor Price (such 90% Conversion Price or 80% Conversion Price, as the case may be, the “Alternate Conversion Price”). If certain defined “Triggering Events” defined in the Certificate of Designations occur, such as a breach of the Registration Rights Agreement, suspension of trading, or our failure to convert the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock when a conversion right is exercised, failure to issue our common stock when the PIPE Warrant is exercised, failure to declare and pay to any holder any dividend on any dividend date, certain defaults on our debts or contractual obligations, or upon a “bankruptcy triggering event” (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), then we may be required to pay a dividend that is added to the stated value on the Series A Preferred Stock in the amount of 18% per annum, but paid quarterly in cash, so long as the triggering event is continuing, or to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for cash in an amount of a minimum of 125% of the Conversion Amount (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) of the Series A Preferred Stock or 125% of the Conversion Amount of the Series A Preferred Stock would be entitled to convert into our common stock at the Alternate Conversion Price. In the event that we experience a “Change of Control” (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) we may also be required to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for cash at a minimum of 125% of their Conversion Amount. In addition, if thirty days after our common stock commences trading on Nasdaq the sum of the average daily dollar volume for the 10 days previous to conversion divided by 10 is less than $2,500,000, then the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a one-time dividend equal to an 8% increase in the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock, or an $80 increase per share in stated value, resulting in a stated value of $1,080 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. This dividend was paid during the first quarter of 2022. The Certificate of Designations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of Allarity Therapeutics, Inc. was filed as Exhibit 3.4 to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended, filed with the SEC on September 13, 2021.



On May 4, 2022, the Company and the Investor entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Waiver, dated April 27, 2022, wherein the Investor confirmed that no Triggering Event as defined under the Certificate of Designations has occurred prior to April 27, 2022, that a Triggering Event under Section 5(a)(ii) will and has occurred on April 29, 2022, and that in consideration for the Registration Delay Payments the Company is obligated to pay under the RRA, and additional amounts the Company is obligated to pay under the Certificate of Designations and the Investor’s legal fees incurred in the preparation of the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver in the aggregate of $538,823 paid upon execution of the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver, and so long as the Company pays the Registration Delay Payments that become due and payable under the RRA after the execution of the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver, the Investor has agreed to forbear exercising any rights or remedies that it may have under the Certificate of Designations that arises as a result of a Triggering Event under Section 5(a)(ii) of the Certificate of Designations and Section 4(c)(ii) of the PIPE Warrant until the earlier to occur of (i) the date immediately prior to the date of occurrence of a Bankruptcy Triggering Event, (ii) the date of occurrence of any other Triggering Event under Section 5(a) of the Certificate of Designations (excluding any Triggering Event arising solely as a result of Section 5(a)(ii) of the Certificate of Designations and Section 4(c)(ii) of the PIPE Warrant), (iii) the time of any breach by the Company under the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver, (iv) the Resale Availability Date as defined therein and (v) June 4, 2022, which was subsequently extended to June 20, 2022 (such period, the “Forbearance Period”). Provided that the Company is not in breach of its obligations under Forbearance Agreement and Waiver, effective as of the Trading Day immediately following the Resale Availability Date, the Investor agrees to waive any rights or remedies that it may have under the Certificate of Designations that arises as a result of a Triggering Event under Section 5(a) of the Certificate of Designations and Section 4(c)(ii) of the PIPE Warrant that may have arisen prior to the date of the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver. The Resale Availability Date was achieved on June 6, 2022, resulting in the Investor waiving any rights or remedies that it may have under the Certificate of Designations that arises as a result of a Triggering Event under Section 5(a) of the Certificate of Designations and Section 4(c)(ii) of the PIPE Warrant that may have arisen prior to the date of the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver.

On June 6, 2022, we entered into that certain First Amendment to the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver with 3i, LP (the “Amendment”) to extend the forbearance period date under subsection 5 of Section 2 of the Forbearance Agreement and Waiver dated April 27, 2022 (the “Original Agreement”) from June 4, 2022, to June 20, 2022. In addition, the parties agreed that the forbearance period of June 20, 2022 may also be extended for an additional fifteen (15) days to July 5, 2022, provided that, on June 20, 2022 the Company will remove the restrictive legend on 441,005 shares of common stock of the Company issued in connection with the conversion of certain shares of Series A Preferred Stock (“Conversion Shares”) by 3i, LP pursuant to the conversion notice dated May 2, 2022, and 3i, LP is able to sell the Conversion Shares free of restrictions (including volume restrictions) pursuant to SEC Rule 144(b)(1)(i).



On December 9, 2022, the Company and 3i, LP entered into a letter agreement which provided that pursuant to Section 8(g) of the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock, the parties agreed that the Conversion Price (as defined in such Certificate of Designations) was modified to mean the lower of: (i) the Closing Sale Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) on the trading date immediately preceding the Conversion Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) and (ii) the average Closing Sale Price of the common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the Conversion Date, for the Trading Days (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) through and until the Company and 3i agree to terminate that definition.



Bridge Loan



On November 22, 2022, the Company entered into a Secured Note Purchase Agreement with 3i, LP (the “Secured Note Purchase Agreement”) for a bridge loan to extend the Company’s cash runaway beyond December 31, 2022, in order to provide the Company with more time to complete the process of amending its Certificate of Incorporation to increase it authorized share capital and proposed reverse stock split to facilitate additional capital investments (the “Bridge Loan”). Under the Secured Note Purchase Agreement, the Company has authorized the sale and issuance of three 3i Promissory Notes, with the first note in an aggregate principal amount of $350,000 to be issued at closing (which was received in November 2022); the second note in the principal amount of $1,666,640 to be issued at closing and which represents the payment of $1,666,640 due to 3i, LP in Alternative Conversion Floor Amounts, as defined in the Certificate of Designations, that began to accrue on July 14, 2022; and the third note in an aggregate principal amount of $650,000 with respect to a new loan to be funded upon the Company filing a registration statement with SEC in connection with a registered offering. As of December 31, 2022, all of the notes have been issued and are outstanding. Each 3i Promissory Note matures on January 1, 2024, carries an interest rate of 5% per annum, and is secured by all of the Company’s assets pursuant to the Security Agreement. In addition, 3i, LP may exchange the 3i Promissory Notes for the Company’s common stock, or other equity security, at an exchange price equal to the lowest price per share of the equity security sold to other purchasers, rounded down to the nearest whole share, if the Company concludes a future equity financing prior to the maturity date or other repayment of the 3i Promissory Notes. In addition, each 3i Promissory Note and interest earned thereon may be redeemed by the Company at its option or the holder may demand redemption if the Company obtains gross proceeds of at least $5 million in a financing in an amount of up to 35% of the gross proceeds of the financing.
Amendment to the Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock



On November 22, 2022, the Company amended Section 12 of the Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock to provide for voting rights. Subject to a 9.99% beneficial ownership limitation, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock were granted the right to vote on all matters presented to the stockholders for approval together with the shares of common stock, voting together as a single class, on an “as converted” basis using the “Conversion Price” (initially $9.9061 per share before any adjustment) (rounded down to the nearest whole number and using the record date for determining the stockholders of the Company eligible to vote on such matters), except as required by law (including without limitation, the DGCL) or as otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or the Certificate of Designations of Series A Preferred Stock. The voting rights described above expired on February 28, 2023.
Modification to Conversion Price of Series A Preferred Stock



On December 9, 2022, the Company and 3i, LP, the holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, entered into a letter agreement which provided that pursuant to Section 8(g) of the Certificate of Designations, the parties agreed that the Conversion Price (as defined in such Certificate of Designations) was modified to mean the lower of: (i) the Closing Sale Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) on the trading date immediately preceding the Conversion Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) and (ii) the average Closing Sale Price of the common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the Conversion Date, for the Trading Days (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) through and inclusive of January 19, 2023. On January 23, 2023, the Company and 3i, LP amended the Letter Agreement to provide the term Conversion Price will be in effect until terminated by the Company and 3i, LP.
Establishment of Series B Preferred Stock



On November 22, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors established the Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Series B Preferred Stock”). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock has 400 votes and is subject to certain redemption rights and voting limitations. See description in exhibit titled “Description of Capital Stock – Series B Preferred Stock.”

Issuance of Series B Preferred Stock Dividend



Effective December 5, 2022, the Company issued a stock dividend to be distributed as follows to stockholders of record as of close of business on December 5, 2022: (i) 0.016 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for each outstanding share of common stock; and (ii) 1.744 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. An aggregate of 190,786 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued as a stock dividend
Annual Stockholder Meeting and Redemption of Series B Preferred Stock



On February 3, 2023, we held our previously adjourned annual meeting of stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”). Nine proposals were submitted to our stockholders for a vote at the Annual Meeting including a proposal to increase the number of authorized shares and a proposal to effect a reverse stock split. Upon conclusion of the Annual Meeting, all of the 190,786 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were automatically redeemed, with the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock only having a right to receive the purchase price for the redemption, which was $0.01 per share of Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, the proposals to increase the number of authorized shares and to effect a reverse stock split did not pass by the requisite shareholder vote at the Annual Meeting. In light of our financing needs and our obligations to 3i, L.P., as holder of the Series A Preferred Stock and PIPE Warrant, we conducted a private placement offering pursuant to which we issued 50,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.
Establishment of Series C Preferred Stock and Sale of Series C Preferred Stock



On February 24, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series C COD”) with the Delaware Secretary of State designating 50,000 shares of its authorized and unissued preferred stock as Series C Preferred Stock with a stated value of $27.00 per share. On February 28, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Series C COD (the “COD Amendment”) to clarify the terms of conversion price and floor price based on definitions provided in the Series C COD (the COD Amendment, together with the Series C COD, the “COD”). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock has 620 votes and is subject to certain redemption rights and voting limitations. See description in exhibit titled “Description of Capital Stock - Series C Preferred Stock.”



On February 28, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with 3i, L.P. for the purchase and sale of 50,000 shares of Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value of $0.0001 per share of Series C Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $24.00 per share, for a subscription receivable in the aggregate amount equal to the total purchase price of $1.2 million (the “Series C Offering”). The Shares are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to the terms of the COD. The conversion price for the Series C Preferred Stock is initially equal the lower of: (i) $0.182, which is the official closing price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) on the Trading Day (as defined in the COD) immediately preceding the Original Issuance Date (as defined in the COD); and (ii) the lower of: (x) the official closing price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date or such other date of determination; and (y) the average of the official closing prices of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) for the five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the Conversion Date (as defined in the COD) or such other date of determination, subject to adjustment herein (the “Conversion Price”), with the Conversion Price being no less than $0.0370 (the “Floor Price”). In the event that the Conversion Price on a Conversion Date would have been less than the applicable Floor Price if not for the immediately preceding sentence, then on any such Conversion Date the Company will pay the Holder an amount in cash, to be delivered by wire transfer out of funds legally and immediately available therefor pursuant to wire instructions delivered to the Company by the Holder in writing, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the higher of (I) the highest price that the Common Stock trades at on the Trading Day immediately preceding such Conversion Date and (II) the applicable Conversion Price and (B) the difference obtained by subtracting (I) the number of shares of Common Stock delivered (or to be delivered) to the Holder on the applicable Share Delivery Date with respect to such conversion of Series C Preferred Stock from (II) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the applicable Conversion Amount that the Holder has elected to be the subject of the applicable conversion of Series C Preferred Stock, by (y) the applicable Conversion Price without giving effect to clause (x) of such definition. The Offering closed on February 28, 2023.





11







In connection with the Series C Offering, concurrently with the SPA, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with 3i, L.P. (the “RRA”) pursuant to which the Company is required to file a registration statement with the SEC to register for resale the shares of Common Stock that are issued upon the potential conversion of the Shares. Under the terms of the RRA, if we fail file an Initial Registration Statement (as defined in the RRA) on or prior to its Filing Date (as defined in the RRA), or fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement beyond defined allowable grace periods set forth in the RRA, we will incur certain registration delay payments, in cash and as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal to 2.0% of 3i, L.P.’s subscription amount of the Shares pursuant to the SPA. In addition, if we fail to pay any partial liquidated damages in full within seven (7) days after the date payment, we will have to pay interest at a rate of 18.0% per annum, accruing daily from the date such partial liquidated damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full. The Company has also agreed to pay all fees and expenses incident to the performance of the RRA, except for any broker or similar commissions. In connection with the Series C Offering, the Company and 3i, L.P. entered into a limited waiver agreement pursuant to which 3i, L.P. confirmed that the sale and issuance of the Shares will not give rise to any, or trigger any, rights of termination, defaults, amendment, anti-dilution or similar adjustments, acceleration or cancellation under the existing agreements with 3i, L.P.



Special Meeting of Stockholders



Pursuant to a proxy statement filed with the SEC on or about March 6, 2023, (the “Proxy Statement”), the Company will be holding a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) virtually online on March 20, 2023. Stockholders of record of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and Series C Preferred Stock on March 3, 2023 (the “Record Date”) will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting and any adjournments, continuations or postponements thereof that may take place At the Special Meeting, the stockholders of Common Stock and Series C Preferred Stock will be voting on the following proposals: (1) to approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of authorized shares from 30,500,000 to 750,500,000, and to increase the number of our common stock from 30,000,000 to 750,000,000, in substantially the form attached to the Proxy Statement as Appendix A (the “Share Increase Proposal”); and (2) to approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, in substantially the form attached to the Proxy Statement as Appendix B, to, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), effect a reverse stock split with respect to the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a ratio between 1-for-20 and 1-for-35 (the “Range”), with the ratio within such Range to be determined at the discretion of the Board (the “Reverse Stock Split Proposal”) and included in a public announcement. Under the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, the holders thereof may only vote on Proposal 1 (Share Increase Proposal) and Proposal 2 (Reverse Stock Split Proposal) and for no other matters. Each holder of one share of Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to six hundred twenty (620) votes representing 31,000,000 votes in the aggregate assuming 50,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock is outstanding.
Our Therapeutic Candidates



Our most advanced therapeutic candidate, dovitinib (formerly TKI258), was designed to be a second-generation “pan”-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with the ability to inhibit numerous classes of tumor-driving tyrosine kinases (both receptor and internal), including FGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, c-Kit, Flt-3, and CSF-1. Numerous pan-TKIs are approved and in use for the treatment of cancers, including Sorafenib (NEXAR®, Bayer), Lenvatinib (LENVIMA®, Eisai), and Tivozanib (FOTIVDA® AVEO Oncology) and this class of drugs is increasingly showing promise in combination with immuno-oncology drugs, including checkpoint inhibitors. Dovitinib was previously developed by Novartis in 56 clinical trials, and through a Phase 3 clinical trial, where it showed therapeutic equivalence (with similar adverse events profile) to Bayer’s Sorafenib for the third treatment of mRCC, but failed to show that it was statistically significantly superior to Sorafenib. Dovitinib also previously showed encouraging Phase 2 clinical trial results for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer. We have retrospectively validated our DRP® companion diagnostic for dovitinib using clinical trial gene expression data (from patient biopsies) from prior Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of this therapeutic candidate. In retrospective analysis of mRCC, patients selected with our Dovitinib-DRP® have an observed fifty percent (50%) increase in median overall survival when compared to DRP® negative patients. We plan to clinically advance dovitinib in combination with our therapeutic candidate stenoparib in future clinical trials for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer using our dovitinib-specific DRP® companion diagnostic to select and treat likely responder patients. We believe that dovitinib, if approved, could be broadly applicable and gain market share in the pan-TKI market as a combination therapy product in other indications as well. As discussed above, as a result of the FDA’s determination that our NDA filed on December 21, 2021, was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and therefore was not accepted for filing, we anticipate that we will need to conduct additional prospective clinical trials to support our retrospective analysis of prior clinical trials and have decided on advancing dovitinib in combination with our therapeutic candidate, stenoparib, or another approved drug, in future clinical trials. Our decision to advance dovitinib as a combination therapy and not as a monotherapy is based on our belief that both the science and the market for oncology therapies has shifted towards combination therapies and away from monotherapies for multiple indications of cancer. We further believe that our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic is tumor agnostic and our retrospective analysis of the clinical data generated in the Novartis clinical studies will also support a companion diagnostic for dovitinib in second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer.

Our second priority therapeutic candidate, stenoparib, is a selective inhibitor of the key DNA damage repair enzyme poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which also has, in clinically relevant doses, a unique inhibitory action against Tankyrases, another important group of DNA damage repair enzymes. DNA damage repair mechanisms are crucial to mammalian cell survival and replication, and so inhibition of key DNA damage repair enzymes, such as PARP, has clinically demonstrated to be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of cancer. Tankyrases are enzymes involved in the stabilization and maintenance of telomeres (the ends of chromosomal DNA) during cell replication, and so disruption of Tankyrases is thought to provide an additional mechanism of impeding cancer cell growth. There are four PARP inhibitors currently approved and used for the treatment of cancers, primarily ovarian and breast cancers. Most of these approved PARP inhibitors use mutation of BRCA genes, which encode another important DNA damage repair enzyme as a biomarker for whether the patient will respond to a PARP inhibitor. The theory is that tumors already defective in BRCA, which are then treated with an inhibitor of PARP, will suffer higher cell/tumor death than tumors with active BRCA, effectively resulting from a synergistic inhibition of multiple DNA damage repair pathways. Stenoparib has demonstrated a superior therapeutic and toxicity profile compared to competitive PARP inhibitors and has the potential to be a beneficial drug, if approved. In addition to stenoparib’s dual PARP and Tankyrase inhibitory activity, we believe stenoparib may cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) — potentially leading to treatment opportunities for primary brain cancers and brain metastases from tumors elsewhere in the body , and shows less myelotoxicity than the other approved PARP inhibitors.



Additionally, we have developed and retrospectively validated our Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic using clinical trial biopsies from the prior Phase 1 clinical trial of this therapeutic candidate. In retrospective analysis of this trial, we have observed that patients selected with our Stenoparib-DRP® have a fourfold (4X) improvement in overall survival when compared to DRP® negative patients. Our putative Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic identified a substantially broader responder patient subgroup than use of single biomarkers, including BRCA mutation, alone, thus potentially enabling the treatment of more patients. We plan to apply for initial market approval for stenoparib, in the U.S., for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, using our Stenoparib- DRP® companion diagnostic to select and treat likely responder patients or as a combination therapy with our therapeutic candidate, dovitinib. We are currently advancing a Phase 2 clinical trial for stenoparib for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer at trial sites in the U.S. and Europe, together with its Stenoparib-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, for which the FDA has previously approved an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. Subject to funding we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors.



Our third priority therapeutic candidate, IXEMPRA® (ixabepilone), is a selective microtubule inhibitor, which interferes with cancer cell division, through mitotic arrest, leading to cell death. Microtubules are polymers of the structural protein tubulin that form part of the cytoskeleton and provide structure and shape to mammalian cells. They are involved in forming the mitotic spindle apparatus that ensures the proper segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells during cell division. IXEMPRA® was formerly developed and brought to market by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and is currently marketed and sold in the U.S. by R-PHARM US LLC for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer treated with two or more prior chemotherapies. There are numerous microtubule inhibitors currently approved and used for the treatment of numerous cancers such as ovarian and breast, including Halaven® (eribulin mesylate), Taxotere® (docetaxel), and Abraxane® (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel). Currently marketed microtubule inhibitors have generated significant sales in the past few years. For example, sales of Halaven® (Eisai) alone were about $400 million in 2019. We have previously developed and retrospectively validated our Ixabepilone-DRP® companion diagnostic using clinical trial gene expression data from a prior Phase 2 clinical trial of IXEMPRA® by BMS. In retrospective analysis of this trial, patients selected with our putative Ixabepilone-DRP® companion diagnostic have an observed 58% increase in complete remission when compared to randomly selected patients treated with ixabepilone. We are currently advancing IXEMPRA®, together with its DRP® companion diagnostic, in a Phase 2 European clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer treated with two or more prior chemotherapies, with the goal of eventually submitting for marketing approval with the EMA for the European market. R-PHARM US, LLC, holds a first buy-back option for this asset.

We are also developing, through external partnerships and out-licensing arrangements, several second priority therapeutic candidates, including a DRP® companion diagnostic for LiPlaCis® and Irofulven in combination with an Irofulven-specific DRP® companion diagnostic in order to improve therapeutic benefit and patient outcomes by selecting and treating the patients most likely to respond to each drug. LiPlaCis® is an advanced, targeted liposomal formulation of Cisplatin. While we previously had an exclusive in-license to develop this drug from LiPlasome Pharma ApS, on March 28, 2022, we agreed to transfer our exclusive development rights to Chosa ApS, an affiliate of Smerud Medical Research International AS and have out-licensed our DRP® companion diagnostic for LiPlaCis® to Chosa. The specific LiPlaCis® formulation utilizes a proprietary phospholipase A (sPLA2-IIA) cleavage substrate for controlled, selective hydrolyzation, disruption and release of drug payload in the presence of tumor cells. This delivery vehicle may result in drug accumulation directly at tumor site, thereby potentially increasing drug targeting at the tumor and reducing negative, off target drug effects and toxicity that is well known for cisplatin. We have previously developed and retrospectively validated a DRP® companion diagnostic specific for cisplatin, which we believe enables us to identify and treat the patients most likely to respond to this therapeutic candidate.



Our therapeutic candidate 2X-111 is an advanced, targeted liposomal formulation of Doxorubicin, that remains one of the world’s most widely used chemotherapies. We exclusively in-licensed this therapeutic candidate from 2BBB Medicines, B.V. The specific 2X-111 formulation, which exploits a glutathione enhanced PEG-liposomal delivery system, we believe may allow 2X-111 to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thereby potentially enabling the treatment of primary brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and secondary brain tumors that originated from cancers outside the brain, such as metastatic breast cancer. The treatment of such brain tumors is a significant unmet need in cancer care, given that patients with primary brain tumors and metastases have few or no meaningful therapy options. We have previously developed and retrospectively validated a DRP® companion diagnostic specific for epirubicin, which may enable us to identify and treat the patients most likely to respond to this therapeutic candidate. 2X-111 has previously shown encouraging results in a Phase 2 trial (without use of a DRP® companion diagnostic) for the treatment of both GBM and brain metastases of mBC. In June of 2020, we out-licensed this program to Smerud Medical Research International, our long-time CRO partner in Europe, which was subsequently terminated on March 28, 2022, in connection with our out-licensing of our DRP® companion diagnostic for LiPlaCis® to Chosa discussed above. We are currently in discussions with SMERUD about a revised agreement under which SMERUD, together with original drug owner 2BBB Medicines, B.V., will secure grant funding to advance this program, with DRP® companion diagnostic support from us.



Irofulven (6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene), is a unique DNA damaging agent, is a semi-synthetic sesquiterpene derivative of illudin S, a natural toxin isolated from the Jack O’lantern mushroom (Omphalotus illudens). Until July 23, 2021, we exclusively in-licensed this therapeutic candidate from Lantern Pharma, Inc. Irofulven has two primary anti-tumor mechanisms of action: first, it produces bulky single strand DNA adducts that are only repairable by the transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway; and second, it stalls RNA polymerase II leading to transcription and cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The therapeutic candidate was formerly developed, between 1995 and 2007, in 41 different clinical trials, including through Phase 3 clinical trials, which demonstrated Irofulven’s single agent activity in a range of indications, including castration-resistance prostate cancer (CRPC), ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancer, and clinical activity in combination treatments targeting CRPC, colorectal and thyroid cancers. We have previously developed and patented a putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven, which we believe enables us to identify and treat the patients most likely to respond to this therapeutic candidate although we have not yet filed a PMA with the FDA for this companion diagnostic. In order to devote more of our development resources to our priority therapeutic candidates, on July 23, 2021, we terminated our drug development agreement for Irofulven and sold our inventory of API, our clinical data and records, and our know-how relating to Irofulven to Lantern Pharma, and granted a non-exclusive license to Lantern Pharma to use our putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven in exchange for $1 million and future additional milestone and royalties. Although we may be entitled to future milestone payments and royalties if Lantern Pharma advances the development of Irofulven with or without our putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven, we will no longer devote any of our development resources to advance this therapeutic candidate.



We retain exclusive worldwide rights to all the therapeutic candidates in our pipeline, with the exception of IXEMPRA® for which we have exclusive European rights and our putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven, which we have out-licensed to Lantern Pharma, Inc. and our DRP® companion diagnostic for LiPlaCis® which we have out-licensed to Chosa. We have a broad intellectual property portfolio comprised of more than 17 granted DRP® patents covering 70 different cancer drugs, and another 27 DRP® patent applications pending covering 2 additional cancer drugs. Our rolling patent strategy allows our DRP® patents to be listed in FDA's Orange Book for the drugs where they occur in the approval label. We also control remaining composition of matter, formulation, and methods of use patent coverage on dovitinib and stenoparib which extend out to 2028 or 2032 depending on the relevant patents.

Strategy



We strive to deliver meaningful benefit to patients with serious unmet medical needs in oncology by developing potentially breakthrough therapies, together with our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics, in a personalized medicine approach. The core elements of our strategy include:




● | Advance our therapeutic candidate, dovitinib, in combination with our therapeutic candidate, stenoparib, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors, together with our Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Our decision to advance dovitinib as a combination therapy and not as a monotherapy is based on our belief that both the science and the market for oncology therapies has shifted towards combination therapies and away from monotherapies for multiple indications of cancer. We further believe that our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic is tumor agnostic and our retrospective analysis of the clinical data generated in the Novartis clinical studies will also support a companion diagnostic for dovitinib in second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerate enrollment in, and conclusion of, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials for stenoparib in ovarian cancer and IXEMPRA® in metastatic breast cancer. Our ongoing, DRP®-guided Phase 2 clinical trial of stenoparib as a treatment for ovarian cancer, being conducted at trial sites in the U.S. and Europe, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate accelerating enrollment in our stenoparib clinical trial and concluding the clinical trial, with data read out, sometime sometime in the second half of 2023. Similarly, the recent start of our DRP®-guided Phase 2 clinical trial of IXEMPRA® as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer, being conducted at numerous locations in Europe, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the regulatory agencies, the internal review boards and the clinical trial sites continue to emerge from COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate accelerating enrollment in our IXEMPRA® clinical trial and concluding the clinical trial, with interim data read out, in the second half of 2023.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support the continuing, external clinical development of our secondary pipeline assets towards value inflection points. We have previously out-licensed both LiPlaCis® and 2X-111, to our longtime CRO partner Smerud Medical Research International, in our efforts to advance the clinical development of these assets. In March 2022, we restructured our LiPlaCis® license agreements with Smerud and original drug owner LiPlasome Pharma ApS, in a way that will enable Smerud to step into the shoes of Allarity and assume full control of this program for further development in a Smerud affiliate, Chosa ApS, and to secure additional investment funding and collaborative development of the program through the affiliate. Allarity and SMERUD are currently in discussions about a revised agreement, together with original drug owner 2BBB Medicines, B.V., about future clinical advancement of 2X-111. We intend to support both of these clinical programs with our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics and our clinical trial and regulatory expertise, and are in ongoing negotiations with SMERUD to extend the financing pathways and timeframe for these programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to leverage our deep insights in tumor biology and predictive diagnostics to pursue innovative clinical candidates. We have established, over many years, expertise, and capabilities in the evaluation of oncology therapeutics with coupled companion diagnostics utilizing our proprietary DRP® platform. We intend to leverage these capabilities to identify, acquire, and advance additional new, clinical stage assets that may benefit patients with serious unmet medical needs, through a precision medicine approach.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize value of our therapeutic candidate pipeline. We currently own the exclusive worldwide development and commercial rights to each of our therapeutic candidates, with the exception of IXEMPRA®, for which we own exclusive European rights, LiPlaCis® which is now being developed by Chosa ApS, and Irofulven, which is now being developed by Lantern Pharma. We intend to evaluate collaborations that could maximize the value of our therapeutic candidate pipeline, either through the evaluation of our therapeutic candidates in combination with compounds owned by third parties or through geographic collaborations outside of the U.S. that allow us to leverage the existing infrastructure of other companies. For example, there are a number of pharmaceutical companies in oncology markets in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America markets that we believe are interested in partnering with us, and or acquiring license rights from us, in order to develop and commercialize our oncology products in those substantial oncology therapeutics markets.

Our Companion Diagnostics



Overview of Our DRP® Companion Diagnostic Platform



Our patented DRP® platform is a proprietary technology that enables the development of drug-specific companion diagnostics that are used to identify patients that will most likely respond to a particular cancer therapy. While our strategy is to use our DRP® platform to advance our own therapeutic candidates, we believe our DRP® platform could be used by many other cancer drugs, both in clinical development and those on the market.



A companion diagnostic is an in vitro diagnostic device or test that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. After the companion diagnostic is approved for use by the FDA, the use of the companion diagnostic with an approved therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the companion diagnostic and the corresponding therapeutic product.



In cancer therapy, personalized medicine, also known as precision medicine, aims to match therapeutic products to those patients (and only those patients) who will positively respond to that therapeutic product, to maximize the benefits and minimize risks from the therapeutic product received. Personalized medicine in the field of oncology therefore depends on (1) understanding the molecular pathophysiology of cancer and (2) the ability of companion diagnostics to accurately and reliably detect and measure molecular biomarkers. Consequently, these companion diagnostics inform both the clinical development of therapeutic candidates and the approved use of therapeutic products.



Our DRP® platform facilitates personalized medicine in cancer patients by addressing the crucial fact that the specific cancer tumor biology within a patient that determines whether a patient will (or will not) respond to a particular cancer drug is largely unique to that patient:








16







We believe our DRP® platform addresses the great complexity of cancer, and is fundamentally different from classical or competitive approaches, in that we let the tumor tell us what cellular mechanisms are important to its response (or resistance) to a given cancer drug:






Our DRP® platform is a powerful bioinformatic engine that is based on advanced systems biology and transcriptomics, meaning that it analyzes all genes that are transcribed (i.e. expressed) as RNA and/or microRNA in a tumor and whether those transcribed genes are affected in response to treatment of the tumor (or cancer cells) with a given approved drug or therapeutic candidate. Our approach differs greatly from simple genetic tests, such as those for a critical mutation in a single gene, and provides a much deeper level of insight into a tumor’s likelihood of responding to a particular approved drug or therapeutic candidate, that may not be observed by simply looking at a patient’s DNA sequence information.



When we create a new, drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic using our DRP® platform, we start with an established panel of cancer cell lines, which have been treated with the cancer drug or therapeutic candidate, to correlate the genetic expression profile of cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant to the drug or therapeutic candidate. In our development of a companion diagnostic, we usually use a well-known collection of 60 human tumor cell lines from the National Cancer Institute known as the “NCI-60” panel, however we also use proprietary cancer cell line panels. Gene expression profiles of the cancer cell lines are derived from a microarray (commercially available Affymetrix Gene Chips) to quantify the level of mRNA and/or microRNA that have been transcribed from genes in those cells. The advanced bioinformatic algorithm at the heart of our DRP® platform then identifies, from all mRNA, the specific ones that are correlated with either drug or therapeutic candidate response or resistance, and the collection of these biomarkers becomes a “fingerprint” of response (or resistance) to that drug or therapeutic candidate. Our DRP® platform then applies what we believe to be a unique “biological relevance filter” — created from analyzing more than 3,000 actual biopsy samples from human clinical trials across a broad range of cancer types and cancer drug and therapeutic candidate types — to remove biomarkers that are not relevant to actual clinical response of tumors (from patients) and thus reduce the background noise from our observations. This process generates a putative DRP® companion diagnostic, specific for the drug or therapeutic candidate, which identifies a subpopulation of cancer patients most likely to respond to the drug or therapeutic candidate. Typically, between 50 and 400 biomarkers (i.e. expressed genes) comprise a putative DRP® companion diagnostic for a specific drug or therapeutic candidate.





17







However, before we can confidently use the DRP® companion diagnostic with real cancer patients, either in clinical trials for a therapeutic candidate or for an approved and on market drug, we must retrospectively validate the predictive power of the DRP® for that drug or therapeutic candidate by accessing tumor biopsies (or gene expression data from such biopsies) from prior clinical trials of the drug or therapeutic candidate, and then retrospectively predicting which patients will respond to the drug or therapeutic candidate. When possible, we do our analysis in a “blinded” manner, meaning that we have no access to patient information and whether they did or did not respond to the drug or therapeutic candidate. Using this protocol of analysis, we believe we are able to retrospectively validate whether our putative DRP® companion diagnostic would have correctly identified those patients who did respond to the drug or therapeutic candidate. At this stage, we also establish a cutoff score for the putative DRP® companion diagnostic, in order to capture most of the responsive patients while excluding most of the nonresponsive patients in the tested population. Typically, we set a DRP® cutoff score for a given cancer drug at 50%, although we may use a more stringent cutoff score for certain cancer types or drugs.



The following image shows an exemplary process flow for creation of our Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic:






If we succeed with the final retrospective validation step, then our putative DRP® companion diagnostic is ready for submission as an IDE to the FDA and, if approved, use with actual patients in clinical trials. Depending on the outcomes of our clinical trials, a Pre-Marketing Authorization (“PMA”) application may be made with the FDA and, if approved, our DRP® companion diagnostic may be used with an approved drug in cancer therapy. The following image shows how to use a drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic, in practice, to test whether a patient will or will not respond to a given cancer drug:






For example, we may receive, at our diagnostic laboratory (or a partner diagnostic laboratory), a biopsy sample from a hospital or cancer center where a patient is being treated. Often, this biopsy sample is formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Generally, we prefer a recent biopsy to an older (e.g. diagnostic) biopsy, since tumors may change, at the molecular biology level, with each round of therapy they are treated with. Gene expression in tumor cells from the biopsy is determined in the same manner as in the cell lines previously described above. The expression levels of the relevant biomarkers (that comprise the DRP® companion diagnostic) in the patient’s tumor are compared to the DRP® reference in order to assess how closely the patient’s biomarker expression levels match the reference. We then apply the relevant DRP® score cutoff (e.g. 50%) for that drug to determine whether the patient has a high enough DRP® score to be identified as a likely responder for the drug.





18







Our DRP® platform has been retrospectively validated by us using retrospective observational studies in 35 clinical trials that were conducted or sponsored by other companies. The FDA considers a retrospective observational study to be one in which the study identifies the population and determines the exposure/treatment from historical data (i.e. data generated prior to the initiation of the study) with the variables and outcomes of interest determined at the time the study is designed. See, Framework for FDA’s Real-World Evidence Program, page 6 (December 2018), https://www.fda.gov/media/120060/download. The FDA has accepted our retrospective validation in support of two IDE applications to conduct clinical trials, one with respect to LiPlaCis® and one with respect to stenoparib. We believe our DRP® platform has successfully generated drug-specific putative DRP® companion diagnostics for a broad range of cancer drugs and therapeutic candidates with different mechanisms-of-action (e.g. kinase inhibitors, chemotherapeutics, HDAC inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, hormone receptor inhibitors, etc.) and across both solid and hematological cancers. Although none of our putative DRP® companion diagnostics have yet been approved by the FDA for marketing, the following graphic illustrates some retrospective validations we have conducted (a strong clinical impact suggests that use of the putative DRP® companion diagnostic may result in a 3X to 5X increase in therapeutic benefit for DRP®-selected patients, while a moderate clinical impact suggests that the DRP® companion diagnostic may provide a 2X increase in therapeutic benefit):






While these retrospective observational studies validate the ability of the DRP® platform to predict likely responders, few of these retrospective studies meet the criteria for proof of efficacy and safety required by the FDA. Usually, the FDA requires a sufficiently powered phase III clinical trial before a PMA may be approved.



Although we believe our DRP® platform is very robust and retrospectively validated, we are not always successful in discovering a putative DRP® companion diagnostic in all cases. Generally, the limited number of failures we have encountered have been with cancer drugs with a mechanism-of-action that is not directly cytotoxic (i.e. it acts directly on the cancer cell leading to cell death), such as angiogenesis inhibitors that interfere with new blood vessel development to the tumor. Additionally, we have experienced some failures to develop a putative DRP® companion diagnostic for a given drug or therapeutic candidate when biopsy materials are too old, or when too many intervening treatments have taken place from the time of original biopsy to current treatment.



Our DRP® companion diagnostics have been patented for more than 70 anticancer agents across a broad range of cancer drugs. Studies involving our DRP® platform, and resulting putative DRP® companion diagnostics, have also been extensively published in peer reviewed literature and presented at major oncology conferences.





19







Advantages Over Other Biomarker Approaches



The realization of personalized medicine in cancer care has been hampered, in part, due to the general lack of FDA approved companion diagnostics to select and treat those cancer patients most likely to respond to a given drug (while avoiding treatment of those patients likely to not respond). This lack of suitable companion diagnostics we believe has largely resulted from an outdated and overly simplistic view of cancer, which fails to adequately address the great complexity of individual tumor responsiveness to a given drug or therapeutic candidate, and which relies entirely on what the oncology community knows about cancer biology without regard to the much greater body of what we do not know. Accordingly, historic and competitive companion diagnostic approaches mostly rely on a “knowledge-driven” approach that focus only on single biomarkers — and not on more informative and reliable, complex biomarker signatures — that rarely hold up in the clinic or on the market for use with actual patients.



Examples of competitive approaches and technologies and their shortcomings are:




● | Gene Mutation Sequencing. A number of gene mutations have been identified which leads to an alteration in the expressed protein or enzyme, targeted by a drug, which results in the drug no longer binding (or sufficiently binding) to and inhibiting the target. Such mutations are common in kinases, and thus can lead to failure of targeted kinase inhibitors binding to that target. Modern “Next Gen Sequencing” (NGS) of such genetic mutations is one current approach to identify patients who may or may not respond to a given cancer drug. NGS approaches have been commercialized by companies like Foundation Medicine and are also increasingly being used by large cancer centers with their own NGS capabilities. We believe this approach is largely limited by failing to address complex tumor biology and mechanisms of drug response/resistance, much of which is currently unknown, and, accordingly, can only partially identify patient therapeutic response if it is linked to a single gene mutation. This approach is also limited to drugs that target proteins or enzymes that have mutations and is thus not suitable for predicting response to drugs such as chemotherapeutics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drug Target Expression Analysis. This approach uses the level of expression of the actual drug target itself as a biomarker for whether a patient will (or will not) respond to a given drug. A common example is expression of the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase HER2 used as a companion diagnostic for the HER2-targeting cancer drug Herceptin® for the treatment of breast cancer. We believe this approach is also largely limited by failing to address complex tumor biology and mechanisms of drug response/resistance, much of which is currently unknown. Indeed, many patients who are HER2 positive do not respond well to drugs targeting this receptor and/or patients that initially respond become resistant, indicating other, more complex underlying tumor biology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) or “Machine Learning” (ML) Approaches. While there are many companies, including in the companion diagnostics space, currently employing technologies that leverage AI or ML, we believe these computer-based technologies are largely limited to the identification and/or design of potential new drug structures. Currently, we are not aware of any retrospectively or clinically validated, published, or approved companion diagnostic created by any AI-based or ML-based approach.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------









20







In contrast to other alternative companion diagnostics technologies, we believe our DRP® platform enjoys several, unique competitive advantages:




● | Broadly Applicable. We believe our DRP® platform can successfully generate a drug-specific companion diagnostic for most cancer drug types, including:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mechanisms-of-action as diverse as DNA damaging agents,
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | chemotherapeutics,
--+-------------------


● | targeted kinase inhibitors, and
--+--------------------------------


● | epigenetic enzyme inhibitors.
--+------------------------------


● | Retrospectively Validated. The ability of the DRP® platform to generate reliable and accurate predictive DRP® companion diagnostics has been retrospectively validated in more than 35 clinical trials and 1 prospective clinical trial.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensively Published. Studies of our DRP® platform and putative companion diagnostics have been extensively published in peer-reviewed literature, including publications such as the British Journal of Cancer, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Plos One, and Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, and have been presented at major oncology conferences, including ASCO, ESMO, and EACR.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accepted for Use in Clinical Trials by Regulatory Agencies. Although none of our putative DRP® companion diagnostics has yet been approved by a regulatory agency for marketing, the U.S. FDA has previously granted 2 IDE applications approving the use of DRP® companion diagnostics for both stenoparib and LiPlaCis® in clinical trials. The Company previously filed a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application, with the FDA, for the approval and use of the Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic as a marketed companion diagnostic for dovitinib in mRCC. In February 2022 the FDA issued a RTF letter on review of this PMA, largely based on the FDA’s issued RTF letter on the related NDA. Separately, the stenoparib, IXEMPRA® and LiPlaCis® DRP® companion diagnostics have been accepted for use in clinical trials by national regulatory agencies in the U.S. and/or Europe.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Trusted by Clinicians. Prominent oncologists at leading cancer centers where we were conducting our DRP®-guided clinical trials, including Guy’s Hospital (London, England), and Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, Denmark), have used our putative DRP® companion diagnostics to select and treat likely responder patients and improve patient outcomes in a personalized medicine approach in such trials. 

Our Priority Therapeutic Programs



Overview of Dovitinib (pan-TKI)



Our most advanced therapeutic candidate, dovitinib (formerly TKI258), is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases. It inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), along with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), among others. During clinical development, with dovitinib’s unique pharmacological profile, the focus was originally on FGFR driven diseases, and also on those diseases where the additional anti-angiogenesis properties of dovitinib would offer a therapeutic advantage. As used in this section of this report describing our therapeutic candidate dovitinib, statements regarding the use of our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics or our proprietary DRP® platform or our observations that our therapeutic candidate dovitinib may have anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity or is observed to be well tolerated in a patient population should not be construed to mean that we have resolved all issues of safety and/or efficacy for our therapeutic candidate dovitinib or our putative Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Issues of safety and efficacy for any therapeutic candidate or companion diagnostic may only be determined by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.



Dovitinib exhibits a dual mechanism of action including anti-tumor effects via its anti-proliferative activity as well as anti-angiogenic activity. Dovitinib is a potent inhibitor of the FGFR1 (inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of 8 nM), FGFR2 (IC50 of 40 nM) and FGFR3 (IC50 of 9 nM), as well as of the VEGFR 1, 2, and 3, PDGFRβ, c-Kit, RET, TrkA, CSF 1R, and FLT3 with IC50s of less than 40 nM. Stem cell factor (SCF), also termed KIT ligand or steel factor, has been shown to modulate tumor angiogenesis. In cultured human endothelial cells and c-Kit expressing cancer cells, dovitinib was observed to inhibit VEGF and SCF- stimulated mitogenesis; in a second model of angiogenesis driven by FGF-2, dovitinib was observed to potently inhibit neovascularization of Matrigel® plugs in vivo with an average effective dose (50% inhibition) (ED50) of 3 mg/kg. The effects on endothelial cells suggest that dovitinib may have potent anti-angiogenic activity. FGFR and PDGFR are also believed to play a role in the proliferation of certain tumor cells and supporting stromal cells. As a result of inhibition of target receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by dovitinib, other ligand- stimulated cellular functions are blocked, including activation of downstream signaling molecules, cellular proliferation, and survival. Anti-tumor effects for this agent may therefore be secondary to anti-angiogenesis, anti-proliferative activity against tumor cells, and anti- stromal activity.





21







Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as VEGFR1,2,3, FGFR1,2,3, and PDGFRβ have been shown to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis (Dvorak 2003). VEGF is produced by both the host and the cancer cells and VEGF has a direct effect on endothelial cells, causing their proliferation, migration, invasion, and growth (Nagy et al 2002). Sunitinib and sorafenib, both multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the VEGF pathways, have become the standard of care for patients with advanced kidney cancer. Subsequently, other anti-angiogenic agents including, bevacizumab in combination with interferon alpha, pazopanib, axitinib and cabozantinib have also been approved by the FDA for advanced RCC.



The mTOR pathway has been shown to play an important role in angiogenesis through regulation of the synthesis of HIF and proteins that control cell proliferation, such as c-myc and cyclin D1. (Jiang BH, Liu LZ. Role of mTOR in anticancer drug resistance: perspectives for improved drug treatment. Drug Resist Update 2008;11(3):63-76. doi:10.1016/j.drup.2008.03.001). Based on favorable risk benefit ratio FDA has approved mTOR inhibitors such as temsirolimus and everolimus for advanced RCC that have demonstrated anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor activities via action on HIF and stopping the production of cell-cycle regulators. All of these targeted therapies have been established as the preferred first or second line of therapies in patients with advanced RCC, with a median overall survival of up to 26 months, although sorafenib, the original prototype receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKi) has been relegated to the 3rd line setting following failure of targeting of the VEGF and mTOR pathways.



Dovitinib was previously developed by Novartis, through a Phase 3 trial, where it showed therapeutic equivalence (with similar adverse events profile) to Bayer’s Sorafenib for the treatment of third line RCC, but failed its primary anti-cancer activity endpoint of superiority (to sorafenib) progression-free survival (PFS). Dovitinib also previously showed promising Phase 2 results in Novartis sponsored studies for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer.



Pre-Clinical Studies



Dovitinib has demonstrated activity in a number of in vitro and in vivo models. It potently inhibits the activity of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including PDGFRβ, CSF 1R, KIT, FLT3, VEGFRs 1-3, TrkA, RET, and FGFR (IC50 = 1-40 nM). Inhibition of these RTKs impedes tumor growth and progression through different mechanisms, including both direct anti- tumor effects and effects on host tissues, such as endothelial cells and supporting stromal cells, that are essential for tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.



The in vivo effects of dovitinib were shown to be a result of its direct anti-tumor effect and also its anti-angiogenic effect. Direct inhibition of RTK activation on tumor cells (PDGFRβ, FLT3, and FGFR3) was confirmed by a reduction in phosphorylation of these target RTKs, as well as signaling pathway components (ERK, STAT5, and AKT) in tumor xenografts. Target inhibition was observed for as long as 24 h after a single high dose of dovitinib. A decrease in tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, in combination with the anti-angiogenic effect of dovitinib, resulted in significant anti-tumor activity. The target RTK profile of dovitinib predicts for activity in many different types of solid and hematologic tumor models by acting on both endothelial cells and tumor cells. In the human tumor xenograft models tested, including colon, prostate, myeloma, AML, breast, and ovarian, dovitinib had anti-tumor effects on both small and large established tumor xenografts.



Studies in the RIP-Tag based experimental tumor model have shown that tumor angiogenesis can switch from VEGFR dependence to FGFR dependence under anti-VEGF therapy. This escape mechanism could explain treatment failure with agents targeting single angiogenic targets. Dovitinib combines potent anti-VEGFR2 and FGFR1-3 activity suggesting the possibility of enhanced response or duration of response in renal tumors compared to agents targeting VEGF only.



Dovitinib was evaluated in the mouse renal cell carcinoma Renca model. Renca cells (1 x 106 cells/mouse) were implanted s.c. into the right flank of Balb/c mice and treatment was started when the average tumor volume was ~70 mm3. Dovitinib was also evaluated in two models for human clear cell RCC: Caki-1, with VHLWT and 786-O with a deletion in the VHL gene and compared to sunitinib and sorafenib. In both human RCC models, dovitinib was at least as effective as the two clinically approved inhibitors at their MTDs.

The studies in clear cell renal carcinoma, A2302 and A2107, were the pivotal and the supporting study, respectively, in the dovitinib NDA, as well as PD02-044, the Dovitinib-DRP® validation study. The indication for the NDA was treatment of patients with advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies and who are selected for therapy with the Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic. As discussed above, based upon the reasons given in the RTF letters and a subsequent Type C meeting with the FDA on May 31, 2022, we anticipate that the FDA will require a prospective Phase 3 clinical trial as well as additional dose optimization studies before regulatory approval of Dovitinib as a monotherapy and its companion diagnostic Dovitinib-DRP for the treatment of third-line mRCC can be obtained.



A2107 is a Phase I/II study on a 5-day on/2-day off treatment schedule in heavily pre-treated advanced RCC patients that are refractory to standard therapies. In the 20 patients treated in phase I with 500 mg (N = 15) or 600 mg (N = 5) dovitinib, the MTD was defined as 500 mg. Dovitinib was observed to be well tolerated and anti-tumor activity was observed after progression on both VEGF and mTOR inhibitors. In the Phase II portion of the study, 67 heavily pre-treated patients were enrolled and received 500 mg dovitinib on a 5 days on/2 days off schedule, and had measurable, histologically or cytologically confirmed progressive advanced or metastatic RCC with predominant clear cell histology. Thirty-five patients were previously treated with at least 2 prior VEGF inhibitors (most often sunitinib and sorafenib) and one mTOR inhibitor (most often everolimus), and 55 patients received at least one VEGF and one mTOR inhibitor. ORR of 3% (90% CI 0.5-9.1), Disease Control Rate (DCR; CR, PR, and SD) of 55.2% and a median progression free survival of 3.7 (95% CI 3.0- 5.6) months according to both independent central review and local review.



A further Phase III registration trial CTKI258A2302 (study A2302), also referred to as the GOLD trial, was conducted in RCC. The pivotal Phase III trial was an open-label, randomized, multi-center study to compare the toleration and anti-cancer activity of dovitinib versus sorafenib in patients (N = 570) with metastatic RCC after failure of anti-angiogenic (VEGF- targeted and mTOR inhibitor) therapies. Supportive data from a Phase I/II dose escalation maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose expansion study CTKI258A2107 (study 2107) in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC (N = 82 at 500 mg) was included in our NDA.



Initially, dovitinib was investigated with a continuous daily dosing schedule. However, preliminary PK data suggested that over-proportional drug accumulation might occur with daily administration. Therefore, a 5 days on/2 days off dosing schedule was proposed for study A2107. At the tested dose levels of 500 mg and 600 mg, no over-proportional drug- accumulation was observed on Day 15 (steady state) with the 5 days on/2 days off regimen. Two patients presented with dose-limiting toxicities at 600 mg, and the MTD was established at 500 mg. Accordingly, Novartis selected the 500 mg 5 days on/2 days off regimen for the Phase III registration trial in the advanced RCC indication (study A2302).



Based on the observed anti-tumor effect of dovitinib against advanced RCC in trial A2107 Novartis proceeded to a Phase III registration trial designed to show superiority over sorafenib. A2302 is the Phase III registration trial, also referred to as the GOLD trial. This pivotal Phase III trial was an open-label, randomized, multi-center study to compare the tolerability and anti-cancer activity of dovitinib versus sorafenib in patients (N = 570) with metastatic RCC after failure of anti-angiogenic (one VEGF- targeted and one mTOR inhibitor) and other therapies. The randomization was a 1:1 ratio to dovitinib 500 mg/day 5 days on/2 days off vs. sorafenib 400 mg BID. The trial failed its primary anti-cancer activity endpoint of superiority (to sorafenib) progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by central radiology assessment (the median PFS was 3.7 months and 3.6 months in the dovitinib and sorafenib arms, respectively and the HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.04)). The median overall survival was 11.9 months for the dovitinib arm and 11.2 months for the sorafenib arm, respectively (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.15). The study was published in Lancet Oncology in 2014 where it was concluded that “Dovitinib showed activity, but this was no better than that of sorafenib in patients with renal cell carcinoma who had progressed on previous VEGF-targeted therapies and mTOR inhibitors.”



The A2302 trial had been designed to show superiority of dovitinib to sorafenib, and the superiority observed in terms of PFS and OS was not statistically significant. Subsequently, Novartis did not pursue further development. However, we believe the trial established that dovitinib is non-inferior to sorafenib with respect to PFS and OS. Non-inferior is the statistical term describing a drug that is a drug that shows equivalent therapeutic benefit to its comparator drug. However, in evaluating our NDA, the FDA determined that our application using a retrospective analysis to show dovitinib is non-inferior to sorafenib cannot be based on a Phase 3 clinical trial by Novartis designed to show that dovitinib is superior to sorafenib that failed its designed endpoints.





25







The two key requirements for the non-inferiority approach are (i) the presence of assay sensitivity of the pivotal study, a finding that is readily demonstrable for the A2302 study, and (ii) the choice of non-inferiority margin, based upon a combination of statistical reasoning and clinical judgement by RCC-subspecialized practitioners offering their clinical perspective on the retention of efficacy needed for the intervention to be considered “efficacious” in that particular malignancy and specific disease setting. The non-inferiority margin for the hazard ratio, i.e., 1.153, was determined using studies that are all phase 3, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where sorafenib was administered as second-line, third-line, or fourth-line treatment. As mentioned above, in the A2302 study, the point estimate of the hazard ratio on PFS was 0.86, and its two-sided 95% confidence interval was (0.72, 1.04). Since the upper bound margin of 95% CI in the unstratified analysis of PFS was 1.04, we believe the non-inferiority of dovitinib to sorafenib is demonstrated because the upper limit (1.04) was less than the estimated margin of 1.153. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses of PFS were consistent with the primary analysis demonstrating the efficacy of dovitinib in this patient population. Patients with KPS ≥ 90 had a higher median PFS in the dovitinib group (median 18.4 months, 95% CI: 12.9, Not evaluable) than the sorafenib group (median 13.9, 95% CI:10.7, 15.5).



The post hoc non-inferiority analysis on the OS was performed using a hazard ratio (HR on OS; dovitinib/sorafenib as secondary endpoint) with a margin of 1.153 with the same hypothesis used for PFS. The OS between the dovitinib and sorafenib treatment groups, had a Hazard ratio of 0.94 with 95% CI: 0.779, 1.146%. Since the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio is <1.153, we believed that the results showed that dovitinib is non-inferior to sorafenib.



The figures below show the progression-free and overall survival from the A2302 Phase 3 trial):

The PD02-044 study intended to identify patients who were more likely to benefit from treatment with dovitinib in the A2302 study and thus validating the Dovitinib-DRP®. 135 dovitinib-treated patients’ renal biopsy tissue comprised the investigational arm of the “Dovitinib DRP Study”. Of these 135 patients, 49 patients had a Dovitinib-DRP® score of> 50%. The key clinical outcomes of PFS, OS, and ORR were compared between the 49 patients with a tumor DRP® score >50% and the sorafenib-treated control arm comprised of 286 patients. The protocol for the “Dovitinib DRP Clinical Performance Evaluation Study” was submitted with the PMA submission. The outcome on the efficacy outcome measure, PFS, revealed a 3.75-month median PFS for DRP®-selected dovitinib-treated patients versus 3.6-month median PFS for sorafenib-treated patients, yielding an unadjusted HR of 0.714 (95% CI 0.5051, 1.0103; p = 0.0572). We believe these results show a marginal and non-significant improvement in median PFS for DRP®-selected dovitinib-treated patients. (Please refer to Figure 1 below.)



Figure 1: Kaplan Meier Plot — Summary of PFS, Efficacy Evaluable Population






The results of the “Dovitinib DRP Study” on the other efficacy outcome measure OS, revealed a favorable outcome. It showed a 14.95-month median OS for DRP-selected dovitinib-treated patients versus an 11.20-month median OS for sorafenib-treated patients. Comparison of these medians yields an unadjusted HR of 0.685 (95% CI 0.4736, 0.9897; p = 0.0439) where the upper bound of the 95% CI does not cross unity, thereby revealing a statistically significant improvement in median OS for DRP-selected dovitinib-treated patients. (Please refer to Figure 2 below).

In an exploratory analysis of the effect of increasing DRP® score thresholds on clinical outcomes, it was shown that as the DRP® threshold increased, so did the clinical outcomes on PFS and OS. Specifically, when the DRP® score threshold increased from 50 to 67, the outcome on the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, further improved to a 5.7-month median PFS for DRP®-selected dovitinib-treated patients versus 3.6-month median PFS for sorafenib-treated patients. Comparison of the median PFS values (resulting from this increase in the DRP threshold score) yields an unadjusted HR of 0.420 (95% CI 0.2054, 0.8585; p = 0.0174) and shows a statistically significant improvement in median PFS for DRP®-selected dovitinib-treated patients when the DRP® score threshold is increased. (Please refer to Figure 3 below). However, in evaluating our NDA, the FDA determined that our application using a retrospective analysis to show dovitinib is non-inferior to sorafenib cannot be based on a Phase 3 clinical trial by Novartis designed to show that dovitinib is superior to sorafenib that failed its designed endpoints.

Overview of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)



Globally, the incidence of RCC varies widely from region to region, with the highest rates observed in North America. Approximately 431,000 new cases of kidney cancer were diagnosed worldwide in 2020 and 179,000 patients died from this malignancy. In the United States, there are approximately 79,000 new cases each year and almost 14,000 deaths from RCC on an annual basis. In Europe, there were approximately 130,000 cases of RCC and 54,000 deaths due to kidney cancer in 2020.



Renal cell carcinomas arise from the proximal tubal epithelium. Alternatively known as clear-cell cancer or renal adenocarcinoma, RCC is characterized by a distinct clear or granular cell appearance visible by light microscopy.



The most common molecular abnormality in clear cell RCC is loss of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which is found in about 50-70% of sporadic cases. Sporadic somatic and hereditary germ cell mutations cause the loss of the VHL protein 9Pvhl0 and VHL negatively regulates hypoxia inducible genes, such as those encoding Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF 1)-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) ß and the glucose transporter GLUT-1.



Approximately 25% of the patients present with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, including locally invasive or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and 50% of the patients undergoing curative surgery can be expected to experience relapse at distant sites. Median survival for patients with metastatic disease is approximately 2 years with the 5-year overall survival < 10% that has only improved marginally to 11.7% in the 2007-2013 reporting period.



In the last decade and a half, the treatment of RCC has evolved from being predominantly cytokine-based to being grounded in the use of drugs targeting VEGF and PDGF, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways and immunotherapy.



Rationale for Targeting Multiple Kinases in RCC



In the first line setting of advanced RCC, the established therapeutic options include agents conferring VEGF pathway inhibition, (e.g., sunitinib, pazopanib, and cabozantinib), mTOR- pathway inhibition (everolimus, temsirolimus), high-dose interleukin (IL)-2, but more recently, this has shifted to a combination of immune-oncology agents or a combination of immunotherapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.



In the second-line setting, following progression of disease on therapy, or intolerance of the first- line regimen, there are again a number of potential treatment options, including targeted drugs such as axitinib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib in combination with everolimus, and the checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and iplimumab. The optimal sequence of therapy remains an area of active research, partially rooted in the observation that mRCC is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a variable natural history and response to initial and subsequent therapy.



In the third line RCC setting, there is an unmet need for companion diagnostics, like the Dovitinib-DRP®, to help guide therapeutic options and decisions in this patient group. Until recently, there was no newly approved drug in this setting. However, tivozanib was recently approved in March 2021 as a treatment option in the third-line RCC setting.



Although these newly approved targeted agents represent significant progress in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, the majority of advanced RCC patients become resistant or refractory to these therapies. There remains a large and significant unmet medical need for patients whose cancer progresses despite treatment with VEGF and mTOR inhibitors and immunotherapies. Thus, the development of novel therapies, particularly in combination with a predictive biomarker is an unmet medical need in third-line advanced RCC.



Currently, there is just one novel therapy in patients who have failed two previous systemic therapies, namely, the recently approved TKI tivozanib. In a retrospective analysis of 34 patients, third-line sorafenib appears to be active and well tolerated in mRCC after first-line sunitinib and second-line everolimus or temsirolimus. In addition, the most recently approved agent, axitinib, in second-line advanced RCC was also based on a Phase III trial comparing axitinib vs. sorafenib. Sorafenib was selected as an appropriate active comparator for the dovitinib Phase III trial (A2302) in patients who failed both anti-VEGF and mTOR therapies.

Existing pan-TKIs and Our Opportunity



Numerous pan-TKIs, including Nexavar® (sorafenib), Sutent® (sunitinib), Votrient® (pazopanib), and Lenvima® (lenvatintib) are currently used in the treatment of RCC and numerous other indications. Fotivda® (tivozanib) was recently approved as a third line RCC treatment, however its use in clinical practice is yet to be established. The global kinase inhibitor market in 2019 was roughly $33 billion and, according to consensus estimates cited by Leerink, is poised to grow about 13% annually to surpass $50 billion by 2022. Sales of pan-TKIs substantially contribute to this total market. For example, sales of Sutent® were $1 billion in 2018, while sales of Nexavar® and Votrient® were each about $800 million that year. Additionally, sales of certain pan-TKIs, such as Lenvima®, are increasingly being driven, in part, by combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 inhibitors (e.g. Merck’s Keytruda®). In the RCC setting, sales of Nexavar® alone, for example, were $125 million in 2019. The global kidney cancer drugs market size was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow to $6.3 billion in 2022.



The table below lists the therapeutic benefit of pan-TKIs, as well as other agents, approved for the treatment of RCC:

The commercial success of pan-targeted kinase inhibitors has resulted in the development and FDA approval of seven tyrosine kinases for the treatment of RCC over the last 15 years. Adverse grade 3 – 4 events from this class of drugs include hypertension, liver toxicity, GI problems (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), anemia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. Other common adverse reactions include anorexia, mucositis, abdominal pain, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and skin rash. These adverse events vary in frequency and severity among the different tyrosine kinases approved for RCC.



Additionally, most patients develop resistance to pan-TKIs via a number of mechanisms (i.e. genetic alterations, activation of other signaling pathways) or are non-responsive to a given pan-TKI. Accordingly, there continues to be a need for the development and approval of additional, new pan-TKIs, both for the treatment of RCC and other indications.



We believe that our pan-TKI, dovitinib, together with its DRP® companion diagnostic — which enables us to select and treat patients most likely to respond to this drug (while excluding those who will not), uniquely overcomes many of the limitations of current pan-TKIs and, once it is approved with its DRP® companion diagnostic by the FDA, has the potential to be a unique drug that can succeed and compete in the marketplace in numerous cancer indications. If approved by the FDA, the treating oncologist will have a novel diagnostic tool, the Dovitinib-DRP®, to evaluate a cancer patient’s likelihood of responding to treatment with dovitinib and thus individualize the risk/benefit of this drug, versus other therapeutic options, for the patient.



Future Opportunities & Development Plans for Dovitinib



We have decided that the costs, risks and potential benefits of conducting these studies for dovitinib as a monotherapy for mRCC are no longer the best path toward commercial success. We continue to evaluate other potential Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for dovitinib combined with other approved drugs in the mRCC space and in other indications. For example, subject to funding we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors. Our decision to advance dovitinib as a combination therapy and not as a monotherapy is based on our belief that both the science and the market for oncology therapies has shifted towards combination therapies and away from monotherapies for multiple indications of cancer. We further believe that our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic is tumor agnostic and our retrospective analysis of the clinical data generated in the Novartis clinical studies for mRCC will also support a companion diagnostic for dovitinib in second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer, as well as other indications. In addition, one of dovitinib’s mechanisms of action is to block the formation of new blood vessels that supply a tumor with nutrients and oxygen (i.e. inhibition of angiogenesis). This causes cancer to enter into a state of homologous recombination deficiency. Homologous recombination plays an essential role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and collapsed replication forks. Cancer cells that are deficient in homologous recombination become hypersensitive to single strand breaks that, if not repaired, lead to double strand breaks. PARP1 is essential for repair of single strand breaks and PARP1 is inhibited by stenoparib. Therefore, a combined treatment with an antiangiogenic agent and a PARP inhibitor may cause a synthetic lethality, which is a type of genetic interaction where the combination of two genetic events results in cell death. Because we hold exclusive, global commercial rights to both dovitinib and stenoparib, we believe that we can efficiently initiate clinical trials to study the possible synergistic activity achieved by combining dovitinib and stenoparib.

Additionally, we are developing a Protocol for a DRP®-guided Phase 2 trial of dovitinib for the treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma. This will be preceded by a Phase 1B dose escalation study in solid tumors in pediatric patients >=2 years of age. Current FDA regulations require, under The RACE for Children Act (Title V, Sec. 504, FDA Reauthorization Act (FDARA), enacted August 18, 2017) as part of an NDA submission for a drug, the concomitant submission of a clinical development plan for the drug in at least one pediatric cancer. Our planned study for pediatric osteosarcoma is based on previously conducted, pre-clinical animal model studies of dovitinib showing that the drug has promising activity in this pediatric indication, which is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults. These pre-clinical studies were carried out in collaboration with the University of Illinois (Champaign, IL USA). Clinical development of dovitinib for pediatric indications will be advanced by OncoHeroes Biosciences, with which we announced a development license and partnership on January 3, 2022. On September 23, 2022, OncoHeroes announced that it had received a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) from the U.S. FDA for the development of Dovitinib for treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma. This RPDD qualifies OncoHeroes to receive fast track review and a priority review voucher (PRV) at the time of marketing approval of Dovitinib for a pediatric cancer indication. We continue to support OncoHeroes in this pediatric cancer development partnership.



The purpose of the pre-clinical studies was to investigate the capacity of dovitinib alone, and in combination with a specific checkpoint inhibition strategy (anti-PD-1), for slowing the progression of experimental pulmonary metastases in animal models of osteosarcoma. Two separate studies, performed contemporaneously in a syngeneic, mouse model of experimental pulmonary osteosarcoma metastases in mice using the K7M2 cell line, generated the following key results:




● | Treatment with dovitinib, compared to control treatment (sucrose solution lacking dovitinib), increased the median survival time by 50%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Anti-tumor growth activity was also observed for dovitinib as a single agent in this model.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, it was found that no significant anti-tumor activity was observed in mice treated with single-agent anti-PD-1 antibody at the investigated dosage and dosing schedule. Furthermore, the combination of dovitinib and anti-PD-1 antibody did not generate additive or synergistic anti-tumor activities equal or greater than observed by dovitinib alone in the mouse osteosarcoma model.



DRP® Companion Diagnostic for Dovitinib



We are developing dovitinib together with a DRP® companion diagnostic, which we believe will enable us to select the patients most likely to respond to the drug in our clinical trials. A Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application for our Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic was filed with the FDA on April 1, 2021. On February 15, 2022, we received RTF letters for both our dovitinib NDA and our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic PMA. The FDA has asserted that neither our NDA or PMA meets the regulatory requirements to warrant a complete agency review. The primary grounds of rejection asserted by the FDA relates to our use of prior Phase 3 clinical trial data, generated by Novartis in a “superiority” endpoint study against sorafenib (Bayer), to support a “non-inferiority” endpoint in connection with the DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic. The primary basis for the RTF of our PMA for the DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic was the RTF of our NDA for dovitinib, to which our PMA relates. Allarity anticipates that it may be necessary to conduct a new, prospective Phase 3 study, to gain approval of dovitinib in the U.S.



The Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic, which comprises 58 expressed genes, was initially developed using cell line testing in the NCI60 panel. The sensitivity of the 60 cell lines to dovitinib was determined. The observed difference in sensitivity was correlated to the observed baseline gene expression in the 60 cell lines and 58 genes were identified as positively correlated or negatively correlated.



The putative Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic, developed through our DRP® platform using gene expression data from cancer cell line testing data, was positively observed using biopsy materials from five Phase 2 trials of the drug and single Phase 3 trial of the drug, sponsored by Novartis AG, that were conducted worldwide from 2010-2015 (clinicaltrial.gov numbers NCT01223027, NCT01379534, NCT01232296, NCT01478373, NCT00958971, NCT01528345).



The following table shows the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively, in our analysis using a DRP® score cut-off of 50% is a single Phase 3 trial sponsored by Novartis AG. All observed measures show an improvement in the DRP® selected patients from the dovitinib arm when compared to the sorafenib arm:




Efficacy Parameter | Dovitinib Dovitinib Score > 50% N = 49 | | Sorafenib Unselected N = 286 | | p-value | | HR
-------------------+-------------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------+---+---------+------------+---
Median PFS, Months | 3.75 | | 3.61 | | 0.0572 | 0.71 | 
(95% CI) | (3.68,5.39 | ) | (3.48,3.71 | ) | | (0.51,1.01 | ) 
Median OS, Months | 15.0 | | 11.2 | | 0.04 | 0.69 | 
(95% CI) | (12.94,26.25 | ) | (9.66,13.37 | ) | | (0.48,0.99 | )

188 patients consented in the dovitinib group, of these, 135 passed established biomarker quality criteria. The DRP-dovitinib divided the patients into two groups, sensitive (n=49, DRP score >50%) or resistant (n=86, DRP score < 50%) to dovitinib. The DRP sensitive population was compared to the unselected sorafenib group (N=286). The graphic below shows a Kaplan-Meier curve of overall survival in these two groups.






A statistically significant improvement in overall survival of patients selected with Dovitinib-DRP® and treated with Dovitinib, when compared to patients treated with Sorafenib, is considered a strong argument in favor of regulatory approval of Dovitinib as a monotherapy together with its companion diagnostic Dovitinib-DRP®. However, we anticipate that the FDA will require a prospective Phase 3 clinical trial as well as additional dosage studies before regulatory approval of Dovitinib as a monotherapy and its companion diagnostic Dovitinib-DRP



We additionally observed that, as expected, the Dovitinib-DRP® does not select responders or patients with longer PFS or OS in the sorafenib arm of the Phase 3 RCC study. This demonstrates that the DRP® is highly drug specific, and thus the Dovitinib-DRP® cannot be used to select responders to sorafenib. Certain details of our Dovitinib-DRP® were published as an e-Poster at the European Association for Cancer Research (EACR) 2021 Virtual Congress held from June 9 to June 12, 2021, and at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2021 Virtual Congress held from September 16 to September 21, 2021.





37







We further tested the predictive power of the Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic in other Phase 2 study cohorts from which pre-treatment or diagnostic biopsies have been obtained, as follows:




● | HCC (NCT01232296): Trial A2208 consisted of 82 patients treated frontline with dovitinib and 82 patients treated frontline with sorafenib. Archival tumor slides or fresh biopsy slides were available for 8 patients from the dovitinib arm and 10 patients from the sorafenib arm.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Endometrial (NCT01379534): Trial A2211 consisted of 53 patients treated second-line with dovitinib. Archival tumor slides or tumor blocks were available for 44 patients, of which 35 met the QC criteria during lab analysis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GIST (NCT01478373): Trial AIC02 consisted of 38 enrolled patients treated second line dovitinib, biopsies were available and met QC for 16 patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Breast cancer combination trial of fulvestrant +/- dovitinib in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients who had evidence of disease progression (NCT01528345, A2210). 47 patients were randomized to fulvestrant+dovitinib, of which 21 had available biopsies that met QC.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Breast cancer monotherapy (NCT00958971, A2202): 1–3 prior therapies in the metastatic setting, N=57 biopsies of which 19 meet QC.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In cohorts from GIST trial IC02 (second line dovitinib, N=16 biopsies) and breast cancer trial A2202 (1–3 prior therapies in the metastatic setting, N=57 biopsies of which 19 meet QC) there was no positive association between clinical outcome and DRP®-Dovitinib prediction. But the 95% confidence interval of the OS and PFS hazard ratios included those hazard ratios observed for the other cohorts and the RCC phase III cohort.



In summary, based on these studies, we believe our putative Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic accurately and reliably identifies responder patients (with mRCC, HCC, breast cancer (ER positive) and endometrial cancer) to this therapeutic candidate, and we plan to use this DRP® companion diagnostic for all of our clinical programs to advance clinical development of dovitinib for these indications including mRCC. As discussed above, based upon the reasons given in the RTF letters and a subsequent Type C meeting with the FDA on May 31, 2022, we anticipate that the FDA will require a prospective Phase 3 clinical trial as well as additional dose optimization studies before regulatory approval of Dovitinib as a monotherapy and its companion diagnostic Dovitinib-DRP for the treatment of third-line mRCC can be obtained. While we have decided that the costs, risks and potential benefits of conducting these studies for dovitinib as a monotherapy for mRCC are no longer the best path toward commercial success, we continue to evaluate other potential Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for dovitinib combined with other approved drugs in the mRCC space and in other indications. For example, subject to funding we anticipate commencing a stenoparib in combination with dovitinib Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer and/or other solid tumors. Our decision to advance dovitinib as a combination therapy and not as a monotherapy is based on our belief that both the science and the market for oncology therapies has shifted towards combination therapies and away from monotherapies for multiple indications of cancer. We further believe that our DRP®-Dovitinib companion diagnostic is tumor agnostic and our retrospective analysis of the clinical data generated in the Novartis clinical studies for mRCC will also support a companion diagnostic for dovitinib in second-line or later treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer, as well as other indications.



Overview of Stenoparib (PARP inhibitor)



Mechanisms of Action



PARP is an enzyme discovered more than 40 years ago that produces large, branched chains of poly (ADP) ribose (PAR) from NAD. In humans, there are 17 members of the PARP gene family, but most of these are poorly characterized. Of the 17 PARP family members, only PARP1 and PARP 2 are known to be involved in DNA repair. PARP is an abundant nuclear enzyme that is activated by DNA strand breaks to synthesize poly (ADP-ribose) from NAD. The main function of PARP is the maintenance of genomic integrity by facilitating DNA repair through the BER pathway. BER is one mechanism by which cancer cells counteract the DNA damage elicited by cytotoxic agents or radiation and thus develop resistance to chemo-or radiation therapies. PARP inhibition may provide a novel mechanism to sensitize refractory tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.



PARP inhibition has shown anti-tumor activity in homologous DNA repair-defective tumors, such as those with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Also, it is well established that cells deficient in homologous recombination are particularly sensitive to DNA-crosslinking agents, including the platinum salts (cisplatin and carboplatin); their BRCA-selective effects are mediated by a similar mechanism to that of PARP inhibitors. Therefore, as platinum salts are frequently used for the treatment of ovarian cancer, including some individuals with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, the combination with PARP inhibitors and DNA agents is an interesting combination that should be explored in clinical trials.

As used in this section of this report describing our therapeutic candidate stenoparib, statements regarding the use of our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics or our proprietary DRP® platform or our observations that our therapeutic candidate Stenoparib may have anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity or is observed to be well tolerated in a patient population should not be construed to mean that we have resolved all issues of safety and/or efficacy for our therapeutic candidate Stenoparib or our putative Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Issues of safety and efficacy for any therapeutic candidate or companion diagnostic may only be determined by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.



Stenoparib is a potent inhibitor of both PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Development of stenoparib as single agent and in combination is supported by preclinical studies. Stenoparib inhibited proliferation in subsets of cells in cell line panels derived from a variety of tumors. Stenoparib, administered as a monotherapy, demonstrated potent tumor growth inhibition in several animal models with tumors featuring underlying defects in DNA repair, including BRCA mutant breast cancer. In addition, stenoparib demonstrated in vivo activity as a single agent in models of B cell lymphoma and AML.



Apart from being a potent PARP1/2 inhibitor, stenoparib also inhibits PARP5a/5b, otherwise known as tankyrase1 and 2 (TNKS1 and 2), important regulators of canonical Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling and maintenance of chromosomal telomerase integrity. Thus, stenoparib inhibited Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling in colon cancer cell lines, likely through TNKS inhibition. Consistent with this possibility, stenoparib stabilized axin and TNKS proteins resulting in Beta-catenin de-stabilization and significantly altered expression of Wnt target genes. This indicates a potential for treating several cancers where aberrant activation of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling can be part of the carcinogenesis and tumor progression.



Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapeutic agent with an activity that can be enhanced by PARP inhibition. PARP inhibition has also been shown to overcome resistance of cells to TMZ. Potentiation of TMZ activity was observed in orthotopic models of melanoma and glioblastoma. In xenograft models, stenoparib inhibition of PARP was observed in tumor tissue by using the PARP pharmacodynamic assay to measure PAR levels.



The predictive biomarker Ataxia-Telangiectasis Mutated (ATM) was selected for use in B cell lymphoma by demonstrating that stenoparib sensitivity was increased through ATM loss in these cells. Certain hematological indications are known to up-regulate P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is implicated in the development of multidrug resistance leading to therapeutic failure and poor outcome. Stenoparib activity is not affected by P-gp over-expression, thus offering a potential advantage in the clinic.



Pre-Clinical Studies



PARP utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as substrate to catalyze the polymerization and transfer of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) to acceptor proteins. The posttranslational modification through addition of PAR results in modulation of target protein function. Stenoparib is a nicotinamide mimetic, competitive PARP inhibitor that inhibits PARP1 and PARP2 equipotently.



In cell-based assays, stenoparib potently inhibited proliferation of the BRCA1 mutant human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436. Additionally, stenoparib inhibited proliferation in the human hematologic cell lines: SR (B cell lymphoma) and MV-4-11-luc2/AcGFP (acute myeloid leukemia (AML)). In the murine leukemia cell line P388, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression had very little impact on inhibition of proliferation by stenoparib.



Oral administration of stenoparib for 28 days significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo in the subcutaneous MDA-MB-436 xenograft model without any significant body weight loss. A dose- responsive pharmacodynamic effect on PARP activity in MDA-MB-436 xenograft tumor tissue was observed following administration of a single stenoparib dose. The decrease in PARP activity was sustained over several hours. These results demonstrate monotherapy activity of stenoparib in a BRCA mutant breast cancer model. Single agent activity was also observed in the AML MV-4-11-luc2/AcGFP survival model. Treatment with stenoparib resulted in decreased tumor burden as measured by luciferase signal, and reduction in disease translated to a statistically significant survival benefit.



In addition to activity as monotherapy, stenoparib demonstrated potentiation of the anti-tumor effects of temozolomide (TMZ), eribulin mesylate (E7389) and carboplatin. In intracranial survival models of melanoma (murine melanoma B16 cell line) and glioblastoma (human glioblastoma multiforme SJGBM2 cell line), the addition of stenoparib to TMZ resulted in a significantly increased survival benefit versus that derived from TMZ alone.

Prior Clinical Trials



The initial planned first-in-human study of stenoparib (conducted by Eisai, Inc.) was an open-Label, Multi center, Phase 1 study of PARP Inhibitor stenoparib (formerly E7449) as single agent in subjects with advanced solid tumors or with B-cell malignancies and in combination with TMZ or with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors. The first part (Phase 1) of the study started on January 31, 2012, and was completed with the last patient visit July 14, 2015. Further clinical evaluation was stopped, as it was decided to stop the clinical development for the reasons described below. Preliminary data after treating the first 28 patients have been presented at ESMO conference 2014. The final data including the retrospective/prospective Stenoparib-DRP® selection results were presented at ASCO 2018.



The study was conducted as Phase 1 single-agent arm (Arm 1) and standard 3+3 dose escalation was performed. During dose escalation, sequential cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects (dose escalation cohorts) were administered increasing doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, and 800 mg (Table 5-1). 41 subjects were enrolled and 33 completed the ‘Treatment phase’ (received first cycle of treatment) while 8 subjects discontinued. 32 subjects continued in the ‘Dose Extension Phase’. During the Dose Extension Phase, the primary reason for discontinuation of study treatment was disease progression (27 subjects due to objective disease progression, which was defined as treatment completion). Two subjects in the 600 mg dose group discontinued study treatment due to AEs with AE being the primary reason for discontinuation as recorded from the disposition page of the Case Report Form (CRF).



All 41 subjects received at least 1 dose of stenoparib and were included in the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics analyses. 12 subjects who received the 600 mg dose of stenoparib in both fed and fasted states were analyzed for food effect.






After a single or multiple oral dose, stenoparib was moderately well absorbed with tmax ranging from 0.5 to 4 hours across subjects and dose groups. The elimination half-life was approximately 8 hours with less than 1.5% of the administered dose recovered in urine. Accumulation based on AUC was minimal (less than 1.2 fold) upon 15 days of dosing across the range of doses.





40







Stenoparib exposure (both Cmax and AUC) appeared to be approximately dose proportional following single or multiple oral doses between 50 mg and 800 mg, with slight deviation at the 400 mg and 600 mg doses. At the 600 mg dose, food delayed stenoparib absorption as evidenced by a shift in tmax by 2 hours, reduced Cmax by 60%, and increased AUC by 10%. The interpatient pharmacokinetic variability is large both with and without food. Thus, the effect of food with the decrease in Cmax, and increase in AUC.






The above figure shows a Linear Plot of Mean (+SD) E7449 plasma concentration versus nominal time (hours) by treatment fasting and after food intake.



Dose dependent inhibition of PARP activity, as demonstrated by percent change in PAR levels, was observed. Maximal inhibition of PARP activity was observed at the MTD dose (600 mg) of single agent stenoparib. Evaluation of PAR levels at the MTD dose of stenoparib (600 mg) in the food effect cohort demonstrated that PAR levels show maximal decrease at 2 to 4 hours post-dose with up to 90% inhibition in PAR levels (from baseline) observed. Sustained PARP inhibition was observed with a 70% or greater decrease in PAR levels observed at 24 hours post-dose. Greater decrease in PAR levels was observed with increasing plasma concentration of stenoparib and with the maximal inhibition observed corresponding to the peak plasma concentration in measurements obtained at Day-2 and Cycle 1 Day 15. A greater decrease in PAR levels was observed with a corresponding higher Cmax when stenoparib was administered without food than when administered with food. No significant changes in percent DNA in tail were observed.



In the finalized Phase 1 study, the majority of subjects (35/41; 85.4%) received up to 8 cycles of treatment with 26 subjects (63.4%) who received up to 2 cycles (<1 cycle = 7, 1 cycle = 5, and 2 cycles = 14); mean number of treatment cycles overall were 3.8 (median = 2 cycles, range: 0 i.e. <1 to 14). The overall median duration of treatment for all dose groups was 57 days (range: 1 to 392 days) with an overall median dose intensity of 11% (range: 1% to 111%) in terms of percentage of planned dose.






In the completed Phase 1 study the following safety results were reported:




● | DLTs were reported in 5 of the 25 DLT evaluable subjects, 4 of these occurred at the 800 mg QD dose (1 Grade 3 fatigue and 3 Grade 2 fatigue resulting in administration of less than 75% of the planned dosage of stenoparib) and 1 occurred at the 600 mg QD dose (Grade 3 anaphylactic reaction). Based on assessment of DLTs, the MTD and RP2D of single agent stenoparib treatment was 600 mg administered orally QD in 28-day cycles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The mean number of treatment cycles received by the 41 subjects treated at the different dose levels of stenoparib was 3.8 (median = 2 cycles, range: <1 to 14). The overall median duration of treatment for all dose groups was 57 days (range: 1 to 392 days).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






41








● | No deaths due to AEs were reported during the study. Nonfatal SAEs were reported in 58.5% subjects overall. The majority of SAEs were considered not related to stenoparib treatment and were reported in not more than 1 subject overall; SAEs reported in more than 2 subjects overall were fatigue (n=3) and lower respiratory tract infection (n=3). Treatment related SAEs included fatigue (n=3), anemia (n=1), anaphylactic reaction (n=1), drug hypersensitivity (n=1), depression (n=1), pyrexia (n=1), and transaminases increased (n=1).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TEAEs occurred in all study subjects. The most frequently reported (>30% of subjects overall) TEAEs were fatigue, chromaturia, decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting. The majority of TEAEs were reported to be Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Overall, Grade 3 events were reported in 27 subjects (65.9%) and the most frequently reported Grade 3 event was fatigue (n=7, 17.1%). A single Grade 4 AE of non-treatment-related hypokalemia was reported in a subject in the 200 mg dose group. No Grade 5 (fatal) events were reported. (Table 5-3)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The most common treatment-related TEAE was fatigue (63%), followed by chromaturia (49%), nausea (34%), diarrhea (29%), and maculo-papular rash (27%). The majority of treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. With the exception of treatment-related fatigue that was reported to be Grade 3 in severity for 4 subjects (2 subjects each in the 600 mg and 800 mg dose groups), all other Grade 3 treatment-related events were reported in not more than 2 subjects overall (Table 5-4).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The study treatment was discontinued due to AEs in 17% subjects (1/3 subjects in 50 mg, 4/21 subjects in 600 mg, and 2/6 subjects in 800 mg dose groups). The events leading to treatment discontinuation included fatigue (n=3), diarrhea (n=2), muscular weakness (n=2), nausea (n=1), photosensitivity reaction (n=1), decreased appetite (n=1), paresthesia (n=1), and anaphylactic reaction (n=1). A total of 24 of 41 subjects (59%) required dose interruptions to manage treatment emergent toxicity. Dose reductions due to AEs were required in 14.6% subjects overall (1/4 subjects in 400 mg, 2/21 subjects in 600 mg, and 3/6 subjects in 800 mg dose groups).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Skin rash was considered as an event of special interest for stenoparib. Overall, 41.5% experienced AEs of skin rash with the highest incidence observed in the 800 mg dose group (66.7%) followed by the 600 mg dose group (47.6%). No serious events of skin rash were reported. All but 1 event of Grade 3 erythematous rash reported with the 600 mg dose group.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Preliminary anti-cancer activity assessment was a secondary objective of Phase 1. Of the total 41 subjects who received single agent stenoparib treatment, best overall response (BOR) could not be assessed for 6 subjects including 5 subjects who discontinued study treatment prior to the first posttreatment tumor evaluation and 1 subject who did not have any target lesion (i.e., measurable disease). None of the 35 subjects assessed had a BOR of CR based on investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1. The overall objective response rate (ORR; CR + PR) was 4.9% (n=2) with 2 PR out of 41 (both in ovarian cancer), and 31.7% SD (13 out of 41), and disease control rate lasting more than 23 weeks was 24.4% (CR+PR+SD: N=10). Both PRs were predicted by the DRP® for stenoparib after analyzing biopsies from 13 of the patients. A waterfall plot of the individual responses of 35 subjects from the safety cohort is presented below:



Anti-cancer activity according to dose groups

PFS for the whole population was 55 days. A Kaplan Meier plot of progression free survival of subjects with PR (green line), SD (orange line), NE (yellow line) and PD (blue line) is below:






The study was published in the British Journal of Cancer in 2020. It concluded that the drug stenoparib “showed good tolerability, promising antitumor activity and significant concentration-dependent PARP inhibition,” and that “The results support further clinical investigation.” Nevertheless, Eisai decided to pursue other priorities and for undisclosed reasons offered the therapeutic candidate to us because we had developed a Stenoparib-DRP® response predictor that we believe could identify the infrequent responding patients.



DRP®-Guided Phase 2 Trials



We have previously conducted an open label, single arm Phase 2 study to investigate the toleration and anti-cancer activity of stenoparib in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients were selected by having a Stenoparib-DRP® score of >80%. Stenoparib was administered as a once daily oral dose of 600 mg in 21-days cycles (study SMR-3475/2X-1001). The study was initiated in June 2018 and discontinued in June 2020 due to inconclusive results. Fourteen patients were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of stenoparib. The median of number of previous chemotherapies were 6. There were 3 patients with ‘stable disease’ response after receiving the treatment, and 1 patient maintained stable disease for more than 26 weeks until the date of disease progression. The overall CBR in evaluable population was 9.1%, PFS was 6 weeks, and OC was 8 months. The most common AE was Fatigue (n = 11; 79%), the second most common AE was decreased appetite and nausea, respectively (n = 8; 57%). There were 8 SAEs reported by 5 patients, 6 events were unrelated, 1 was unlikely to be related, and 1 event (urinary tract infection) was possibly related to the treatment. The data from this mBC trial suggest that a diagnostic biopsy cannot be used for predicting likelihood of drug response, using the Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic, in heavily pre-treated mBC patients, and that new biopsies are needed. By terminating the mBC study, Allarity has decided to focus on advancing stenoparib in indications with a higher likelihood of success, including ovarian and pancreatic cancer.



We are further currently conducting a DRP®-guided Phase 2, open label, single arm study to investigate the toleration and anti-cancer activity of the PARP inhibitor, stenoparib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The protocol (2X-1002) addresses unmet medical needs in ovarian cancer patients that have progressed on previous PARPi therapy without requiring repeat platinum treatment and in selecting both HR proficient and HR mutated patients/tumors with high likelihood of responding. The primary endpoint is ORR as determined by RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints are CBR, PFS and OS. This study is being conducted at Guy’s Hospital (London, England), in addition to other trials sites in the U.S. and Europe. Patients are selected by using the Stenoparib-DRP® with a score of >50%. Stenoparib is administered as a once daily oral dose of 600 mg in a 28-days cycle (study 2X-1002). The study was initiated in April 2019 and 10 subjects that were required to be enrolled independent of DRP® score have received at least 1 dose of stenoparib and are included in the safety SAE reporting. Stenoparib-DRP®-selected patients commenced enrollment in June 2021. The delay in enrolling Stenoparib-DRP®- selected patients has mainly been due to COVID-19 pandemic issues. Since the Phase 2 studies currently are ongoing, anti-cancer activity data from these are too early to report.

Overview of Ovarian Cancer



Ovarian Cancer (OC) is a lethal disease with a 5-year survival rate of 20-30% for advanced OC. It is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women. A large proportion of patients with OC are diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage. The outcome after chemotherapy for advanced OC becomes poorer and poorer each time a new treatment is introduced following progression on the previous treatment. Approximately 14,000 OC patients die each year due to disease progression.



Treatment of OC (as well as breast cancer (BC)) advanced when the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 were cloned in the early 1990s and allowing identification of high-risk individuals. These genes encode proteins that are involved in DNA homologous recombination (HR). Patients harboring germline BRCA1/2 mutations carry a defective copy of the gene in every cell, which increases the likelihood of cancer developing if the remaining copy becomes defective through somatic mutation or epigenetic inactivation. However, there are also patients with germline mutations in other HR pathway genes and patients who do not carry an inherited germline mutation but have tumors with sporadic HRD mutations. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates that approximately fifty percent of high grade serous ovarian cancers have aberrations in HR repair.



Epidemiological studies have shown an association between germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutations and the development of OC, (BC), and to a lesser extent pancreatic and endometrial cancers. Mutation frequencies are estimated to be approximately 15-20% for those diagnosed with OC and 5% for those diagnosed with BC (15). In a recent publication it was shown that for BRCA1 and 2 carriers, cumulative risk for BC by age 80 was 72% and 69%, respectively. For OC, cumulative risk was 44% and 17%, respectively.



The peak incidence of BC occurred in the 41-50-year age group (28.3 per 1000 person-years) for BRCA1 and in the 51-60-year group (30.6 per 1000) for BRCA2 mutation carriers. The incidence of OC was 3.6 times higher for BRCA1 than BRCA2 carriers, with the peak incidence of cancer occurring regardless of mutation type among women in the 61-70-year age group (29.4 per 1,000 in BRCA1 carriers). For BRCA1 and 2 carriers, BC risk increased with the number of first- and second- degree relatives with breast cancer. In contrast, OC risk did not vary with respect to family history of this disease. DNA repair pathways involving BRCA1/2 engage in single or double stranded DNA breaks, which can occur from damage caused by ultraviolet light, the generation of reactive oxygen species, ambient or therapeutic irradiation, day- to-day replication errors or chemical exposure. Cells lacking a functional BRCA1/2 are also deficient in HR and show a high-degree of chromosomal instability as well as increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents that lead to double-stranded breaks.



Rationale for Targeting PARP in Ovarian Cancer



Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are a family of DNA-dependent nuclear enzymes catalyzing the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties from cellular nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD+) to a variety of target proteins. There are 17 PARP family member proteins identified through sequence homology of the catalytic domain. PARP1, 2 and 3 have all been implicated in DNA repair, with PARP1 being the most abundant. PARP inhibitors are designed to compete with NAD+ for the substrate binding to PARP and inhibit PARP activity. Cells containing dysfunctional BRCA1 or BRCA2 have been shown to become profoundly sensitized to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. PARP inhibition is thought to induce synthetic lethality, which describes a process where at least two genetic lesions that individually are not lethal become lethal when combined in the same cell. For example, cells that are deficient in HR, which is not lethal in itself, are hypersensitive to a reduction in PARP activity by PARP inhibitors. However, disruption to other proteins involved in HR DNA repair other than in BRCA may have the same effect on PARP inhibitor sensitivity.



A further important mechanism of action for PARP inhibition is the trapping of the PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes at damaged DNA causing cytotoxicity and cell death. Recent studies have revealed a more complex web of fundamental cellular processes that PARP1 is involved in crucial cell processes other than in DNA damage repair, such as chromatin remodeling and transcription or regulation of the cell cycle.



There are currently three PARP inhibitors approved, in a number of countries but not all yet, for either monotherapy or maintenance therapy or both in patients with advanced OC. Two are approved in patients with BRCA 1 and 2 mutations with advanced OC having undergone therapy with >3 chemotherapies (Olaparib) or >2 chemotherapies (Rucaparib). Two PARPi (niraparib and olaparib) are approved as maintenance therapy in patients with advanced OC who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.



The effectiveness of PARP inhibitors as monotherapy or as maintenance therapy has substantially improved the progression free survival and may be promising for overall survival in OC patients. PARP inhibitors as single agents or as potential enhancers of cytotoxic agents that provoke DNA damage, such as alkylating agents and chemotherapy, have been investigated in a number of studies, including olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and talazoparib, where the two latter PARPi are still under development.



There is a current unmet need for treatment of patients with OC who have progressed on PARPi treatment. Our ongoing Phase 2 study in ovarian cancer allows for enrollment of patients previously treated with a PARPi. We intend to use our Stenoparib-DRP® to select patients from this group that will have a high likelihood of responding to our PARPi, Stenoparib.

Future Opportunities & Development Plans for Stenoparib



Overview of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) & Rationale for Targeting PARP in PDAC



PDAC is the third leading cause of cancer related death in the United States (2018). Initial presentation of the disease is typically with metastasis, and the overall 5-year survival for all stages combined is 8%. Molecular analysis has revealed four subtypes of PDAC giving clinicians further insight into treating this deadly disease. One subtype that has been elucidated and termed “unstable” is significant for the presence of DNA damage repair deficiency and can be targeted by several old and emerging therapies. One such therapy that may be considered are PARP inhibitors.



There have been reports of responses seen to PARP inhibitors in individuals with pancreatic cancer, and there are clinical trials currently (NCT03140670, NCT02184195, NCT01585805) for this patient population. One PARPi (olaparib) was approved by the FDA in December 2019 for the treatment of BRCA1/2 mutated PDAC. Due to the relatively common DNA repair pathway mutations in PDAC tumors, PARP inhibition may be a potential therapeutic option in individuals with advanced PDAC with the HRD phenotype.



Development Plan for Stenoparib in PDAC



This study would be performed as an open, uncontrolled Phase II study of stenoparib in up to 30 advanced PDAC patients. Patients with predicted high likelihood of responding to stenoparib, after inclusion in the pre-screening protocol using the Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic will be included in the study. In this study, a high likelihood of response to stenoparib will be defined as the patient having a Stenoparib-DRP® score of at least 80% or greater. However, this DRP® cutoff can be modified depending on the clinical outcome.



The study will be performed in accordance with the Simon two-stage design (Simon 1989). The patients will come to a screening visit within 2 weeks prior to first administration of stenoparib. Patients will receive a daily dose of 600 mg stenoparib as hard gelatin capsules administered in a 28-day cycle. The treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The clinical endpoint will be objective response rate (ORR), as determined by RECIST 1.1.



Patients will continue the treatment until the occurrence of: (i) disease progression, or (ii) unacceptable toxicity, or (iii) patient refusal/withdrawing of consent, or (iv) non-compliance to the protocol, or (v) physician decision to discontinue treatment, or treatment delay > 2 weeks (except in the case of perceived patient benefit). An End of Treatment visit will be conducted when administration of stenoparib is stopped. Patients with CR, PR or SD where treatment have been stopped will continue follow-up by phone every 12 weeks until death.



Anticipated clinical trials sites and Principal Investigators would include Dr. Dan Von Hoff (U.S.) and Dr. Deb Sarker (UK).



Development for Additional Indications



We have developed a protocol for a Phase II, open label clinical study to investigate anti-tumor effect and tolerability of stenoparib in docetaxel-pre-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients selected by the Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Patients would receive 600 mg stenoparib as single oral agent in a 21-days cycle in in mCRPC patients who progressed on AR-targeted therapy (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide or investigational AR-targeted agent) and docetaxel-pre-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients selected by the Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic. Up to 30 mCRPC patients with predicted high probability of response to stenoparib, as determined by a Stenoparib-DRP®) score of >80%, will be enrolled and treated. Anti-tumor effect of stenoparib is based on objective response rate defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) of > 9 weeks according to RECIST 1.1 for patients with measurable disease and defined as stable disease > 9 weeks including PSA and bone metastases according to PCWG3. This Phase II trial would likely have trial sites in the U.S. and in the EU/Denmark.

DRP® Companion Diagnostic for Stenoparib



We are developing stenoparib together with its validated DRP® companion diagnostic, which enables us to select the patients most likely to respond to the drug in our clinical trials. An Investigation Device Exemption (IDE) for our Stenoparib-DRP® was granted by the FDA (G180165) in 2018. The Stenoparib-DRP®, which comprises 414 expressed genes, was initially developed using a panel of 61 cancer cell lines (provided by Eisai) treated with stenoparib. This putative DRP® contains biomarkers that reflect the mechanism of action of PARP and Tankyrase inhibition by stenoparib, as well as capturing much unknown tumor biology, and is largely independent of BRCA mutation.



The putative Stenoparib-DRP®, developed through our DRP® platform using gene expression data from cancer cell line testing data, was retrospectively validated using biopsy materials from the Phase 1 trial of the drug (formerly E7449), sponsored by Eisai, that was conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2012-2015 (clinicaltrial.gov number NCT01618136). Of 41 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 study, 35 had response assessment. Of these, 2 had PR (5% ORR) and 13 had SD. Biopsies and BRCA analysis were voluntary and available from 16, and 7 patients, respectively. Of the 16 patients with biopsies, 13 passed our QC in the lab and were assayed on the Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2 array.



A statistical analysis plan was completed before initiation of retrospective blinded prediction of stenoparib sensitivity on the 13 samples.



Waterfall plot of 16 Phase 1 patients for which biopsies were available






Before blinded retrospective analysis of mixed histology biopsies from the Phase I trial of stenoparib, two crucial choices were made: 1) to use a reference population of 819 breast cancer biopsies, and 2) to use as cutoff the population median of the Phase 1 biopsies. Both choices turned out to be excellent, because the population median of the Phase 1 biopsies was very close to the population median of the breast cancer reference population, and when applied to the Phase 1 biopsies both medians separated the samples in identical populations with a clear difference in response rate and PFS.



It was decided that the breast cancer reference population with a cutoff of 50% would be used for the proposed Phase II trial. This has the added advantage of being the exact same parameters used for the blinded analysis of the Phase I trial. The only difference is that DRP has been locked and retrospectively validated between Phase I and proposed Phase II. The following figure shows the unblinded comparison of dose-adjusted predicted sensitivity to stenoparib and clinical response to stenoparib (the highest scoring SD patient is actually a long-term progression-free pancreatic cancer survivor (still alive at last check at 406 days, and progression-free at last evaluation at 321 days):

The following figures show Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in two populations, those above a dose-adjusted cutoff of 50 (N=6), and those below a cutoff of 50 (N=7). The hazard ratio is 0.26 (P=0.04 one sided) and the median survival in the predicted resistant group (below cutoff) is 208 days. More than half of the patients remain alive in the group predicted sensitive.





47













Additionally, BRCA mutation status considered, but was only available for 7 patients in the trial (NCT01618136), of which 6 are BRCA mutated. Of these 6, 1 responded to stenoparib, giving a response rate of 1/6 or 16% in the BRCA mutated population. This equals the response rate observed in the unselected 13 patients analyzed with DRP® score. Thus, BRCA mutation does not appear to be a predictor of response in this small trial.



In sum, our retrospectively validated Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic correctly identifies responder patients to stenoparib and we plan use this DRP® companion diagnostic for all of our clinical programs to advance stenoparib, including our ongoing Phase 2 ovarian cancer study.





48







Existing PARP Inhibitors and Our Opportunity



Numerous PARP inhibitors, including Lynparza® (olaparib), Rubraca® (rucaparib camsylate), Zejula® (niraparib) and Talzenna® (talazoparib tosylate) have been approved by the FDA for multiple oncology indications, including ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Sales of these FDA-approved PARP inhibitors were approximately $1.7 billion in 2019 and are forecasted to be over $7.0 billion in 2025, with Lynparza (olaparib) accounting for $1.2 billion and over $4.0 billion in the 2019 and 2025 totals, respectively.



Despite the commercial success of PARP inhibitors, broader adoption is limited by their high rates of GI and bone marrow toxicity which is largely a result of off-target cell killing. Adverse grade 3–4 events from this class of drugs include anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and alopecia. Other common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and decreased appetite.



We believe Stenoparib is distinguished among the PARP class of drugs by the following features and advantages:




● | It is a dual inhibitor of Tankyrases 1 and 2, which provides a likely dual cancer cell killing mechanism by interference with Wnt signaling pathways and chromosomal telomerase maintenance and stability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It lacks myelotoxicity, a common limiting adverse event among PARP inhibitors, at the established MTD.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It is resistant to P-glycoprotein (PgP) mediated export from target cancer cells, resulting in higher accumulation of drug in target cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It can cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), enabling the potential treatment of primary brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and brain metastases from other body tumors, such as malignant breast cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Additionally, the use of our Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic to identify and treat only those patients most likely to respond to the drug (while excluding those patients most likely to be unresponsive to the drug), gives us a substantial advantage in increasing patient response rates, avoiding adverse events in patients that are not likely to benefit from our drug, and providing health economics advantages.



Furthermore, our DRP® for stenoparib identifies a broader group of potential responder patients than can be identified by the competitive biomarker approach of only assessing BRCA 1 and 2 mutation status in order to select and treat patients. The DRP® for stenoparib comprises 414 genes, including Wnt-beta-catenin and a number of DNA repair pathways, and thus is a broader assessment of the tumor responsiveness to the drug than determining mutation in one or two BRCA genes.



Overview of IXEMPRA® (microtubule inhibitor)



Mechanisms of Action



Ixabepilone (IXEMPRA®) is a semisynthetic derivative of epothilone B, with improved in vitro metabolic stability. It is a novel antineoplastic agent that stabilizes microtubule dynamics, resulting in blockade of cancer cells in mitosis during cell division, leading to cell death. Ixabepilone induces a distinct pathway of cellular apoptosis via activation of caspase-2, whereas other tubulin agents, such as the taxanes, act via caspase-9. Ixabepilone is a poor substrate for efflux transporters such as the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP1) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that are involved in drug-resistance mechanisms. Epothilones have a tubulin-binding mode distinct from that of other microtubule- stabilizing agents. Ixabepilone’s tubulin-binding mode affects the microtubule dynamics of multiple ®-tubulin isoforms, including the class III isoform of ®-tubulin (®-III tubulin), the expression of which has been implicated in clinical taxane resistance. As used in this section of this report describing our therapeutic candidate IXEMPRA®, statements regarding the use of our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics or our proprietary DRP® platform or our observations that our therapeutic candidate IXEMPRA® may have anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity or is observed to be well tolerated in a patient population should not be construed to mean that we have resolved all issues of safety and/or efficacy for our therapeutic candidate IXEMPRA® or our putative IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic. Issues of safety and efficacy for any therapeutic candidate or companion diagnostic may only be determined by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.

Ixabepilone has anti-tumor activity in vivo against a broad spectrum of tumor types, including tumors that overexpress P-gp and are resistant to multiple agents including taxanes, anthracyclines, and vinca alkaloids. Ixabepilone demonstrated synergistic in vivo activity in combination with capecitabine. In addition to direct anti-tumor activity, ixabepilone demonstrated antiangiogenic activity in vivo.



The nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies performed with ixabepilone were directed toward the preliminary assessment of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drug. Ixabepilone was (a) orally bioavailable with bioavailability ranging from 8 to 40% in mice, rats, and dogs; (b) extensively distributed extravascularly; (c) moderately bound to serum protein; (d) extensively metabolized to many metabolites and the metabolite profile was similar among species including humans; I metabolized by CYP3A4/5; (f) cleared primarily via oxidative metabolism and then mostly excreted in the feces; (g) neither a CYP inhibitor nor a CYP inducer at clinically relevant concentrations.



Pre-Clinical Studies



The results from the in vitro cytotoxicity studies against extensive panels of human-tissue specific, taxane-sensitive and taxane-resistant (including MDR, ®-III tubulin over- expression, and tubulin mutation mechanisms), cancer cell lines demonstrate that ixabepilone has potent and broad-spectrum antineoplastic activity. The effectiveness of ixabepilone in vitro is paralleled by equally broad-spectrum activity observed in vivo. Ixabepilone demonstrated a broad spectrum of in vivo anti-tumor activity in taxane- sensitive and taxane-resistant human cancer xenograft models. Less frequent dosing schedules allowed higher doses of ixabepilone to be given and performed better than the more frequent dosing schedules. Against a total of 35 human tumor xenografts grown in mice, representing a wide array of tumor types, ixabepilone demonstrated anti-tumor activities, producing 1 LCK or greater anti-cancer activity in 33 of 35 tumors. Ixabepilone demonstrated the ability to overcome drug resistance due to the Pgp-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in vivo, reversing the MDR resistance of 2 established MDR models: the 16C/ADR breast carcinoma models and the HCT116/VM46 human colon carcinoma model. Ixabepilone also demonstrated anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo against a human tumor model that over expresses MRP1 (Pat-7), producing in vitro IC90 values of 7.4 nM (compared with 150 nM for paclitaxel) and an in vivo activity of 2.9 LCK (compared with 0.8 LCK for paclitaxel).



Ixabepilone suppresses the dynamic instability of < ®-III microtubules and< ®-II microtubules. This is in contrast to paclitaxel which had no suppressive effect on the dynamic instability of < ®-III microtubules, but suppressed the dynamic instability of < ®-II microtubules. Thus, ixabepilone should be more effective than paclitaxel at inhibiting proper formation of the mitotic spindle and disrupting mitosis in tumor cells with high expression of ®-III tubulin. On this basis, ixabepilone is expected to be more active on tumors that are resistant to paclitaxel because of over expression of ®-III tubulin.



The in vitro and in vivo cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies conducted with ixabepilone indicated that it is unlikely that ixabepilone will affect electrocardiographic parameters at anticipated plasma concentrations in patients. Ixabepilone induced drug- related clinical signs consistent with peripheral neuropathy in rodents. In a comparative study in rats, ixabepilone and paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy that was similar in nature and characterized by decreases in sensory and motor maximal nerve conduction velocities and reductions in sensory and compound nerve-response amplitudes. There were no ixabepilone-related CNS or respiratory findings.



The combination of ixabepilone with a number of approved anticancer therapeutic agents produced anti-tumor activities that were markedly greater than the best achievable responses from the individual single agents administered at their MTD alone. Such therapeutic synergism was observed with capecitabine, cetuximab, bevacizumab, or trastuzumab. Modest anti-cancer activity enhancement was observed when combined with irinotecan. However, no therapeutic advantage was observed when combined with gefitinib, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel).





50







The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ixabepilone in mice, rats, and dogs are comparable to those in humans, indicating the acceptability of those species for the toxicological assessment of ixabepilone. Serum protein binding of ixabepilone was moderate in rat, dog, and human serum.



In both animals and humans, ixabepilone was extensively metabolized via oxidative metabolism and eliminated mainly through fecal excretion. Only metabolites formed through oxidation of ixabepilone were found in animals and humans. All of the metabolites identified in humans were present in the species used in the toxicological evaluation of ixabepilone. The total amount of metabolites, as a percentage of the total radioactive dose in excreta (urine and feces), was high in all species studied. The known degradants of ixabepilone, BMS-249798, BMS-326412, and BMS-567637, were detected in plasma and excreta across species. The metabolite and degradant profiles in plasma are similar among humans, rats, and dogs, with unchanged ixabepilone being the most abundant drug-related component. Although the pharmacologic activity of individual metabolites is not known, a mixture of in vitro metabolites of ixabepilone was not active in in vitro cytotoxicity assays.



Ixabepilone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The PK of ixabepilone may be affected by the co-administration of agents that inhibit or induce CYP3A4. Ixabepilone is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, but it does not inhibit any of the other common CYP enzymes. Ixabepilone is not an inducer of CYP enzymes in vitro. Based on the efficacious plasma concentration and the in vitro inhibition and induction characteristics, ixabepilone is not expected to affect the PK of co-administered agents that are metabolized by CYP enzymes.



Nonclinical toxicity studies identified the principal target-organ, genetic, and developmental toxicities of ixabepilone. Ixabepilone principally affected tissues having rapid-cell division, including the GI, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, and the male reproductive system. In mice and rats, peripheral neuropathy was also a prominent effect. Ixabepilone-induced toxicities were generally reversible following a 1-month, post dose recovery period, except for delayed testicular effects in rats and dogs and peripheral neuropathy in rats and mice. In rats, females were generally more severely affected than males, consistent with higher systemic exposures in females. When administered daily for 2 weeks or once every 21 days for 6 or 9 months, ixabepilone toxicity was similar to that observed in the single-dose, 5-day, and 1-month intermittent dose (QWx5) toxicity studies, with the exception of loss of bony trabeculae of the femoral growth plate in rats, which was not seen in any other studies. The increased growth-plate thickness observed in the rat is not likely to be a safety risk for the treatment of cancer in adult human populations, because in the rat, unlike humans, the growth plates do not fuse upon reaching sexual maturity.



Ixabepilone was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. Ixabepilone was not clastogenic in the in vitro cytogenetics assay in primary human lymphocytes, but did increase the incidence of polyploid lymphocytes at high concentrations. However, ixabepilone was clastogenic (induction of micronuclei) in the in vivo rat micronucleus study. These findings were similar to other microtubule-stabilizing drugs and result in a benefit-risk analysis in the indicated patient population that supports the use of these drugs for a cancer indication. Ixabepilone did not affect mating or fertility in a rat reproduction study, and induced embryo-fetal toxicity in rats and rabbits only at doses that also caused maternal toxicity. Since clinical administration of ixabepilone occurs at doses associated with minimal to mild clinical side effects, administration during pregnancy may pose a risk for fetal toxicity.



The single- and repeat-dose IV toxicity studies with ixabepilone adequately predicted the clinical toxicities that were subsequently observed in humans. In both experimental animals and humans, ixabepilone toxicities were primarily manifested in the GI, hematopoietic, and peripheral nervous systems. These effects were expected and consistent with the toxicity produced by other microtubule-stabilizing anticancer drugs. In general, the nonclinical species were more sensitive to ixabepilone-induced toxicity than human subjects. In vitro, vincristine and paclitaxel were more potent than ixabepilone in inhibiting mitochondrial axonal transport in fetal dorsal root ganglion culture, whereas in mice and rats, paclitaxel and ixabepilone induced axonal degeneration or decreases in nerve conduction velocities that were similar in nature and severity. Based on the intended use of ixabepilone in treating advanced breast cancer and other solid tumors, the scope and results of the nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and exposure studies support the continuous IV administration of ixabepilone on a once every 21-day cycle in this patient population.

Prior Clinical Trials



Ixabepilone (IXEMPRA®) was originally developed through Phase 3 clinical trials and brought to market by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). In Phase 1 clinical trials of ixabepilone as monotherapy, objective responses were demonstrated in a variety of tumor types, including breast, colon, head and neck, ovarian, endometrial, vulvar, and peritoneal cancers, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.



Dose-limiting toxicities observed in Phase 1 clinical trials of ixabepilone as monotherapy included sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, myalgia, and fatigue. Adverse events (AEs) reported in Phase 1 studies in which ixabepilone was used in combination with other chemotherapy agents (e.g., carboplatin [CA163007], doxorubicin [CA163008], and irinotecan [CA163025]) were similar qualitatively and in frequency to that observed in monotherapy studies; no toxicities unique to combination therapies were reported.



The PK of ixabepilone are linear, based on consistent total body clearance and apparent terminal elimination half-life across doses from 15 mg/m2 to 57 mg/m2. The coadministration of ketoconazole increases ixabepilone exposure in patients. Ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine, or voriconazole should be avoided. If alternative treatment cannot be administered, a dose adjustment should be considered, and patients should be monitored closely for acute toxicities. Pharmacokinetics results indicate that exposure to ixabepilone is increased by 22%, 30%, and 81% in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic dysfunction, respectively. After coadministration of ixabepilone and capecitabine, PK differences are minor and are not expected to affect the toleration profile or anti-cancer activity of either ixabepilone or capecitabine.



In a Pha½1/2 clinical trial (CA163031) evaluating ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), common toxicities included fatigue, nausea, hand-foot syndrome, and sensory neuropathy.



Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrated the activity of ixabepilone in advanced breast cancer, non- small cell, small-cell lung cancers, prostate cancer, gastric, and other malignancies. The most notable toxicities reported in Phase 2 trials of ixabepilone as monotherapy are peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, myalgia, arthralgia, alopecia, and fatigue. The peripheral neuropathy has been predominantly sensory, cumulative in nature, and reversible upon discontinuation of ixabepilone.



In a large, international Phase 3 clinical trial (CA16304612) in patients with taxane-resistant and anthracycline-pre-treated or resistant metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine resulted in a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR) compared to capecitabine monotherapy, per the independent radiology review committee (IRRC). Another similar, large, multicenter, international randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial (CA16304813) compared ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine to capecitabine alone in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. CA163048, in which OS was the primary endpoint, demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful superiority in PFS and improved RR over capecitabine alone that translated into a modest improvement in overall survival (OS) favoring the combination which did not meet statistical significance. These studies were conducted in 29 countries, with more than 300 clinical investigators and over 1,200 treated patients. The studies included dozens of trial sites spread throughout European countries.



Based on the Phase 3 clinical trials, ixabepilone was approved by the FDA in 2007 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the following settings:




● | In combination with capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in patients after failure of an anthracycline and a taxane.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As monotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in patients after failure of an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.

Despite the positive Phase 3 clinical trial results leading to approval of Ixabepilone in the U.S., the drug has not yet been approved in Europe, due to the EMA’s determination of insufficient risk-benefit for Ixabepilone under the European socialized medicine pricing structure. Subsequently, IXEMPRA® was out-licensed to us to pursue approval in Europe using our IXEMPRA®-DRP®-selected patient population in order to show statistical significance in further clinical trials that the therapeutic candidate has sufficient risk-benefit under European standards to support a pricing structure that would be appropriate.





52







As of March 2009, more than 3,144 patients have been treated with ixabepilone in BMS- sponsored Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. In addition, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) independently conducted a number of clinical studies. These studies demonstrated the activity of ixabepilone in a variety of tumor types, including breast, hormone-refractory prostate, pancreatic, renal cell, non-small cell and small-cell lung cancers, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.



DRP®-Guided Phase 2 Clinical Trial



We are currently conducting a DRP®-guided, Phase 2, open label, single arm clinical trial — in Europe — to investigate the toleration and anti-cancer activity of IXEMPRA® as monotherapy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer after failure of an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine. This clinical trial, with an enrollment target of 60 IXEMPRA®-DRP®-selected patients, is being conducted at numerous sites in Europe, including Belgium, England, Finland, Poland and Germany. Patients are selected by using the putative IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic at a cut-off score of sixty-seven percent (67%), and IXEMPRA® is administered at 40 mg/m2 infused intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks (in accordance with the U.S. label of the drug). Dose reduction is required in certain patients with elevated AST, ALT, or bilirubin. The trial was initiated in April 2021. Thus far, several DRP®-selected patients have been enrolled and dosed in the trial, despite delays resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The clinical trial’s goal is to provide a superior clinical benefit to DRP®-selected patients receiving IXEMPRA®, as compared to historical clinical data from breast cancer patients treated with IXEMPRA® but not selected with the putative DRP® companion diagnostic for the drug. Since the Phase 2 clinical trials currently are ongoing, data from these trials is not yet available to report. We have entered into a cost sharing arrangement with Smerud Medical Research International, our CRO for the Phase 2 clinical trial, where Smerud has agreed to accept a single digit share of any proceeds we generate from the commercialization or disposition of IXEMPRA® in exchange for the anticipated costs our CRO would incur in conducting the Phase 2 clinical trial up to an agreed upon maximum amount of costs incurred.
Overview of Metastatic Breast Cancer



Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide, and the second most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 1.8 million new diagnoses per year. In the U.S., breast cancer has the highest prevalence among all cancers. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (“SEER”) Program at National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2020, there will be 276,000 new cases of breast cancer in the U.S. alone, and more than 40,000 deaths. Treatment options for breast cancer depend on many factors, including the stage of cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease which is grouped into several clinical subtypes based on the expression of three proteins: ER, progesterone receptor (“PR”) and HER2. Both ER and PR are hormone receptors, and tumors that express either of these receptors are referred to as hormone receptor-positive. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 75-80% of all breast cancers express estrogen receptor (“ER+”) highlighting the central role of ER signaling in driving a large majority of breast cancer. Although early-stage non-metastatic disease is curable in approximately 70-80% of patients, advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. Advanced breast cancer comprises inoperable locally advanced breast cancer, which has not spread to distant organs, and metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer; common sites of spread are bone, lungs, liver, and brain. Currently, it is a treatable but virtually incurable disease, with metastases including to the brain being the cause of death in almost all patients, and a median overall survival of two to three years. Patients with metastatic breast cancer receive treatments that aim to relieve their symptoms and to prolong quality-adjusted life expectancy.



Treatment often continues until the cancer starts growing again or until side effects become unacceptable. If this happens, other drugs might be tried. The types of drugs used for stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer depend on the hormone receptor status and the HER2 status of the cancer. Women with hormone receptor-positive (estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive) cancers are often treated first with hormone therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor). This may be combined with a targeted drug such as a CDK4/6 inhibitor, everolimus or a PI3K inhibitor. Women who haven’t yet gone through menopause are often treated with tamoxifen or with medicines that keep the ovaries from making hormones along with other drugs. Because hormone therapy can take months to work, chemo is often the first treatment for patients with serious problems from their cancer spread, such as breathing problems. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for women with hormone receptor-negative (ER-negative and PR-negative) cancers. These breast cancers are either HER2 positive or triple negative.





53







Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) may help women with HER2-positive cancers live longer if it’s given along with chemo or with other medications such as hormonal therapy or other anti-HER2 drugs. Pertuzumab (Perjeta®), another targeted drug, might be added as well. Other options might include targeted drugs such as lapatinib (which may be given with certain chemo drugs or hormone therapy) or ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla®). For HER2-negative patients, treatment depends on specific gene mutation status. Women who have a BRCA mutation are typically treated with chemotherapy (and hormone therapy, if the cancer is hormone receptor-positive). An option after getting chemotherapy is treatment with a PARP inhibitor, such as olaparib or talazoparib. Women who have a PIK3CA mutation are typically treated with alpelisib, a targeted PI3K inhibitor that can be used along with fulvestrant to treat postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer.



For women that have triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) — HER2 negative, ER negative, and PR negative — the immunotherapy dug atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) if often used, along with albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane®) in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer with tumors expressing the PD-L1 protein (which is expressed is about 20% of triple-negative breast cancers.) For women with TNBC and a BRCA mutation whose cancer no longer responds to common breast cancer chemo drugs, platinum drugs (like cisplatin or carboplatin) may be considered.



According to the current estimates, the global therapeutics market for treatment of breast cancer was valued at over $19 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach over $40 billion by the year 2026, at a CAGR of 10.6%. By way of example, in 2019, worldwide sales for endocrine and targeted therapies treating ER+ breast cancer patients totaled $9.6 billion. Given the incidence rate and cost of treatment, by 2027 the market size for adjuvant therapy, first line treatments and second line treatments could total $25 billion, $8 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Accordingly, the potential market for treatment of mBC, including treatment of brain metastases (for which there is currently no approved therapy) is large and growing.



Rationale for Targeting Microtubules in mBC



IXEMPRA® is approved and on market in the U.S. as third- or fourth-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the following settings:




● | In combination with capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in patients after failure of an anthracycline and a taxane.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As monotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in patients after failure of an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Accordingly, the clinical benefit of IXEMPRA®, a microtubule inhibitor, in these patient groups is already established. We seek to gain approval of this drug in Europe, for the same mBC patient groups, in connection with our putative IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic, used to select and treat the most likely responder patients for the drug, in order to yield a superior therapeutic benefit in selected patients. Further, use of our putative DRP® companion diagnostic is expected to provide an improved benefit versus risk ratio, which we believe should support an EMA approval. IXEMPRA® was previously rejected by the EMA on basis of the risk versus benefit ratio.



Future Opportunities & Development Plans for IXEMPRA®



Potential Development for Neoadjuvant mBC Setting



Since the retrospective validation of the IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic showed a 58% increase in complete remission of patients treated with IXEMPRA® (see below) as adjuvant therapy, there is a potential to expand the IXEMPRA® drug plus a DRP® companion diagnostic combination to this setting as an attractive alternative to the commonly used paclitaxel. The neoadjuvant mBC setting is a substantially larger market opportunity than the third- or fourth-line mBC setting.



DRP® Companion Diagnostic for IXEMPRA®



We are developing IXEMPRA® together with its retrospectively validated DRP® companion diagnostic, which we believe enables us to select the patients most likely to respond to the drug in our clinical trials. Our Phase 2 clinical trial protocol, including use of the putative IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic is in process of being approved by the regulatory agencies in the countries where we are conducting the clinical trial, and is already approved for use in clinical trials in Belgium, Finland, UK and Poland. The putative IXEMPRA-DRP® companion diagnostic, which comprises 198 expressed genes, was initially retrospectively validated using gene expression data from patient biopsies in the prior Phase 2 clinical trial of ixabepilone in neoadjuvant breast cancer setting that was conducted by BMS (NCT00455533). In retrospective analysis of this trial, patients selected with our putative IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic was observed to have a 58 percent (58%) increase in complete remission when compared to randomly selected patients treated with ixabepilone.





54










In sum, we believe our retrospectively validated putative IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic accurately and reliably identifies responder patients to this drug, and we plan to use this DRP® companion diagnostic for all of our clinical programs to advance IXEMPRA®, including our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for mBC.



Existing Microtubule Inhibitors & Our Opportunity



A number of microtubule inhibitors are approved and on market for the treatment of multiple cancer types. These approved drugs include docetaxel (Taxotere®), eribulin (Halaven®), ixabepilone (IXEMPRA®), paclitaxel (Taxol®, Abraxane®), and vinorelbine (Navelbine®). Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel are also called taxanes. Currently marketed microtubule inhibitors have generated several $billions of sales in the past few years. For example, sales of Halaven® (Eisai) alone were about $400 million in 2019, and sales of vinorelbine exceeded $110 million in 2018. The following table (2019) summarizes many of the approved microtubule inhibitors:

Anti-tubulin agents first approved by FDA (*), EMA (**) or in other countries (***). ALL: acute lymphoblastic leukemia; CML: chronic myelogenous leukemia; NSCLC: non-small-cell lung carcinoma



According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, in the second line metastatic breast cancer (mBC) setting, for patients who are HER2 negative, ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine is a therapeutic option, along with other microtubule inhibitors, such as eribulin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, and epirubicin. The choice of a particular microtubule therapeutic is made by the treating oncologist, and the current lack of suitable companion diagnostics to guide therapy selection has hampered the introduction of personalized medicine to this patient group. Our current clinical program for ixabepilone in metastatic breast cancer is focused on a third-line monotherapy in patients selected with the IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic.



Despite the success of microtubule inhibitors as a class in the treatment of cancer, the expanded use of these drugs has been limited by certain toxicities, that include neutropenia and neurotoxicity, and the development of tumor resistance to the drugs after long-term use. For example, among taxaIive patients, primary resistance to taxanes is a critical factor for disease progression. More than one-third of patients with metastatic breast cancer do not respond to first-line anthracyclines or taxanes. Taxane resistance rates of up to 55% in anthracycline-pre-treated patients and up to one-third in anthraIne-naive patients have been reported. Second-line, the same spectrum of outcomes can be expected.  



Drug resistance is attributed to heterogeneity of tumors. Each patient has his/her own tumor with different characteristics and therefore different therapy outcomes. The variabilities include but are not limited to different genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and proteomic properties. The genotypic changes include mutations, gene amplifications, deletions, chromosomal rearrangements, transpositions of the genetic elements, translocations and microRNA alterations. Genomic instability generates a great level of intercellular genetic heterogeneity in cancer.



We believe that our microtubule inhibitor, IXEMPRA®, together with its DRP® companion diagnostic, can overcome many of the limitations of current microtubule inhibitors and has the potential to be a leading drug in its class that can succeed and compete in the marketplace for the treatment of mBC, and potentially other indications. The use of the IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic to select and treat only those mBC patients most likely to respond to the drug (while excluding treatment of likely non-responders) can mitigate toxicity events in non-responder patients, while increasing therapeutic benefit in the identified responder patient population. The success of our IXEMPRA® program will establish the ability of our DRP® platform to expand oncology markets for approved cancer therapeutics through a personalized medicine approach using DRP® companion diagnostics.



Secondary Therapeutic Programs



Overview of our DRP® companion diagnostic for LiPlaCis® (targeted, liposomal cisplatin)



Mechanisms of Action



Cisplatin (or cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)) is a chemotherapeutic drug that has been used, since the 1970s, in the treatment of various types of human cancers such as ovarian, lung, head and neck, testicular and bladder. Cisplatin has demonstrated anti-cancer activity against various types of cancers such as germ cell tumors, sarcomas, carcinomas as well as lymphomas. The mechanism of action of cisplatin has been associated with ability to crosslink with the urine bases on the DNA to form DNA adducts, preventing repair of the DNA leading to DNA damage and subsequently induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) within cancer cells. However, the drug exhibits certain level of resistance including increased repair of the damaged DNA, reduction in the accumulation of the drug intracellular and cytosolic inactivation of cisplatin.



The drug is also characterized by various toxic side effects including nausea, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Due to various side effects as well as drug resistance, other anti-cancer drugs that contain platinum such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin, among others, have been used in combination with cisplatin in chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer. In addition to the cytotoxic effects, cisplatin has immunosuppressive and radio-sensitizing properties. As used in this section of this report describing our therapeutic candidate LiPlaCis®, statements regarding the use of our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics or our proprietary DRP® platform or our observations that our therapeutic candidate LiPlaCis® may have anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity or is observed to be well tolerated in a patient population should not be construed to mean that we have resolved all issues of safety and/or efficacy for our therapeutic candidate LiPlaCis® or our putative Cisplatin-DRP® companion diagnostic. Issues of safety and efficacy for any therapeutic candidate or companion diagnostic may only be determined by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.

LiPlaCis® is a novel, targeted liposomal formulation of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. Liposomes are closed spherical vesicles, having an interior aqueous space entrapped by a bilayer lipid membrane. LiPlaCis® liposomes have cisplatin encapsulated in the interior aqueous space of the liposomes and the bilayer membrane is constituted by 3 phospholipids. The use of liposomes as drug carriers has been limited due to the rapid clearance of these carriers from the blood stream by the reticuloendothelial system. The addition of polyethylenglycol (PEG) polymers to the surface of the liposomes leads to reduced clearance rates. As a result, the use of liposomes is now recognized as a promising strategy for tumor-targeted drug delivery. Due to the leaky tumor vasculature and the incomplete lymphatic drainage system of tumors, long circulatory liposomes may be preferentially trapped and therefore accumulate in cancer tissues. The preferential entrapment and accumulation of the liposomes in the cancer tissue is also known as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR-effect). Because of the trapping of liposomes, significantly more drug substance is present at the site of the tumor compared to administration of plain drug products.



However, it has also been realized that the degradation of liposomes and release of the encapsulated drug(s) after the liposomes accumulate in the tumor are critical elements to the success of liposomal drug delivery. This is the case for hydrophilic drugs such as cisplatin, which do not readily diffuse across the liposomal membrane. Such hydrophilic drugs require that tumor-specific degradation of the liposomal carrier takes place before the drug can be released and exert its cytotoxic action on the cancer cells. In fact, the absence of a trigger mechanism in the tumor tissue was proposed as the explanation for the lack of anti-tumor activity in clinical trials using cisplatin containing Stealth® liposomes (SPI-077) (PEGylated liposomes). In these studies, a high level of cisplatin was found in the tumor tissue inside the liposomes, but it was not bioavailable.



LiPlaCis® includes a tumor-specific targeting mechanism on the surface of its liposomes, which triggers the release of cisplatin specifically in tumor tissue. Secretory sPLA2 is a small secreted and phospholipid-degrading enzyme, which is overexpressed in cancer tissue compared to normal tissue. Until now, 10 catalytically active isoforms of sPLA2 have been identified, of which the Group II sPLA2 isoform seems to be the most predominant form in cancer. In normal tissue, Group II sPLA2 has been found to be expressed in cartilage, digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon), and in prostate-, parotid- and lacrimal glands. This enzyme breaks down the LiPlaCis® once it accumulates in the cancer tissue due to the EPR-effect. The lipid composition of the LiPlaCis® is designed to be specifically susceptible to degradation by sPLA2. This leads to tumor-specific release of the encapsulated drug substance in the target tissue. sPLA2 has shown to be overexpressed in a wide range of tumors such as stomach, breast, gastric, liver, lung and pancreatic cancers. It has been shown that sPLA2 expression is increased with advancing stage of cancer disease and that enhanced expression of sPLA2 may be related to tumor progression.



LiPlaCis® enables the targeted transport of high concentrations of encapsulated anti-cancer drugs to cancer tissue. After IV administration, LiPlaCis® will naturally extravasate and accumulate in the extracellular space of the tumor tissue. The secretion of sPLA2 into the extracellular space of the cancer tissue provides further support to the overall concept of achieving a tumor-specific degradation of the LiPlaCis® after extravasation. The targeted delivery of cisplatin to tumors that is achieved by LiPlaCis® has the benefits of transporting this mutagenic and toxic chemotherapeutic to cancer cells while avoiding exposure to healthy cells. The tumor-specific degradation of the liposomal drug carriers by overexpressed sPLA2 offers a novel way to achieve a targeted and triggered release of the encapsulated drugs in the cancer tissue without any prior knowledge of the position and size of the tumor, e.g. undetected metastases.



DRP® Companion Diagnostic for LiPlaCis®



LiPlaCis® is being clinically developed by Chosa ApS together with our prospectively validated DRP® companion diagnostic for cisplatin, which enables Chosa to select the patients most likely to respond to the drug in their clinical trials. In August 2019, the FDA approved our IDE application for use of our Cisplatin-DRP® companion diagnostic in a planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of LiPlaCis® in mBC. In June 2019, we announced that the FDA had provided feedback on our pending IND application and proposed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in mBC using the Cisplatin-DRP®. The Cisplatin-DRP®, which comprises 205 expressed genes, was initially developed using gene expression data from the National Cancer Institute NCI60 panel of cancer cell lines. We have out-licensed our putative Cisplatin-DRP® companion diagnostic to Chosa as described above.





57







Our putative Cisplatin-DRP® companion diagnostic was retrospectively validated in two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts. Molecular prediction of adjuvant cisplatin anti-cancer activity in NSCLC showed a significant prediction at 3-year survival from surgery in univariate (HR = 0.138 (95% CI:0.035 – 0.537), p = 0.004) and multivariate analysis (HR = 0.14 (95% CI:0.030 – 0.6), p = 0.0081).



In sum, we believe our retrospectively and prospectively validated putative LiPlaCis®-DRP® companion diagnostic accurately and reliably identifies responder patients to LiPlaCis®, and we plan to use this DRP® companion diagnostic for all of our clinical programs to advance LiPlaCis®, including the planned, expanded Phase 2 clinical trial for mBC being advanced by our licensee, Chosa ApS.



Overview of 2X-111 (targeted, liposomal doxorubicin)



Mechanisms of Action



2X-111 is an advanced, targeted liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, one of the world’s most widely used chemotherapies. The specific 2X-111 formulation, which exploits a unique, glutathione enhanced PEG-liposomal delivery system, allows the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thereby enabling the treatment of primary brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and secondary brain tumors that originated from cancers outside the brain, such as metastatic breast cancer.



Doxorubicin is a type of chemotherapy drug called an anthracycline. It slows or stops the growth of cancer cells by blocking an enzyme called topo isomerase 2, which is necessary for DNA replication. Topo isomerase 2 is an enzyme that cuts both strands of the DNA helix simultaneously in order to manage DNA tangles and supercoils. Cancer cells need this enzyme to divide and grow. Doxorubicin is approved and in use for a number of cancer types, including breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is often used together with other chemotherapy agents.



Liposomes are closed spherical vesicles, having an interior aqueous space entrapped by a bilayer lipid membrane. 2X-111 liposomes have doxorubicin encapsulated in the interior aqueous space of the liposomes and the bilayer membrane is constituted by 3 phospholipids. The use of liposomes as drug carriers has been limited due to the rapid clearance of these carriers from the blood stream by the reticuloendothelial system. The addition of polyethylenglycol (PEG) polymers to the surface of the liposomes leads to reduced clearance rates. As a result, the use of liposomes is now recognized as a promising strategy for tumor-targeted drug delivery. Due to the leaky tumor vasculature and the incomplete lymphatic drainage system of tumors, long circulatory liposomes may be preferentially trapped and therefore accumulate in cancer tissues. The preferential entrapment and accumulation of the liposomes in the cIncer tissue is also known as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR-effect). As a consequence of the trapping of liposomes, significantly more drug substance is present at the site of the tumor compared to administration of plain drug products.





58







Most PEG-liposomal cancer drugs cannot pass the BBB and therefore cannot be used for treatment of primary or secondary brain tumors. The delicate metabolic homeostasis of the central nervous system is largely maintained by the BBB, which plays a key role in excluding potentially neurotoxic and exogenous compounds from the brain, while still allowing the penetration and uptake of essential nutrients. Many potentially highly efficacious anticancer drugs are currently not available to treat brain tumors because they do not adequately cross the BBB, and therefore do not reach the brain.



Glutathione is an endogenous tri-peptide with antioxidant-like properties in the brain and its active (sodium-dependent) transport receptor is highly expressed on the BBB. The unique 2X-111 glutathione-modified PEG-liposome enables transport of encapsulated drugs, such as doxorubicin past the BBB, enhancing the delivery of such drugs to the brain. As used in this section of this report describing our therapeutic candidate 2X-111, statements regarding the use of our proprietary DRP® companion diagnostics or our proprietary DRP® platform or our observations that our therapeutic candidate 2X-111 may have anti-cancer or anti-tumor activity or is observed to be well tolerated in a patient population should not be construed to mean that we have resolved all issues of safety and/or efficacy for our therapeutic candidate 2X-111® or our putative Doxorubicin-DRP® companion diagnostic. Issues of safety and efficacy for any therapeutic candidate or companion diagnostic may only be determined by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.



Pre-Clinical Studies



Preclinical studies have been performed in order to determine the anti-cancer activity and toleration of 2X-111 both systemically and in the CNS prior to the start of the human clinical trials. 2X-111 showed significantly better tumor growth inhibition and survival benefit in rodents with brain tumors as compared to normal PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx®/Doxil®). In a systemic breast cancer animal model, the tumor suppression was equal between 2X-111 and Caelyx®/Doxil®. Moreover, compared to Caelyx®/Doxil®, enhanced doxorubicin delivery by 2X-111 across the BBB was observed, with a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in animal models. The following graphs represent some of the preclinical observations:

Prior Clinical Trials



2X-111 (formerly 2B3-101) was previously evaluated in Phase I/IIa, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial sponsored by 2-BBB Medicines, B.V. (NCT01818713; NCT01386580). Dieta Brandsma, MD, PhD, Division of Neuro-Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam was the Coordinating Investigator. There were numerous trial sites in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.



The purpose of this study was the determination of safety, tolerability, and PK of 2X-111 both as single agent and in combination with trastuzumab. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore the preliminary anti-tumor activity of 2X-111 as single agent in patients with solid tumors and brain metastases or recurrent malignant glioma, as well as in patients with various forms of breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab in Her2+ breast cancer patients with brain metastases. The study was performed in two phases: a dose escalation phase following a standard “3+3” design to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and a safe dose (MTD) of 2X-111, followed by four expanded study arms where patients were treated at the MTD to confirm the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D).



84 patients were enrolled in this study, including 37 in the dose escalation phase and an additional 47 patients in the expansion safety cohorts. Only patients who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Two populations were used to analyze the study data including:




● | Safety (SAF): Patients who received at least one dose of 2X-111 were evaluable for safety analysis.

In the single agent dose-escalation phase, patients eligible for the study were assigned to a dose level cohort. The starting dose was 5 mg/m2, which was equal to 1/10 of the human equivalent dose of the LD10 of 2X-111 in rats. Dose levels for subsequent cohorts were 10, 20, 30 mg/m2 and steps of 10 mg/m2 thereafter. Patients received a single IV dose of 2X-111 on day 1 of each cycle. To minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2B3-101 (in mg) was infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion was completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Each treatment cycle consisted of 21 days.





61







In the combination with trastuzumab dose-escalation phase, patients were assigned to a 2X-111 dose level cohort. The starting dose of 2X-111 was 40 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. This dose has been selected based upon safety information from patients treated with 2X-111 at this dose level, as well as upon previous treatment with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin in combinations trastuzumab.



In both cases, dose-escalation was conducted in steps of 10 mg/m2 up to the MTD level determined for 2X-111 as single agent. The trastuzumab dose remained fixed to a loading dose of 8 mg/kg at day 1 and 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks at the subsequent cycles throughout the determination of the MTD. All patients received a single IV dose of 2X-111 on day 1 of each cycle. To minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2X-111 (in mg) was infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If 2X-111 was well tolerated, the remaining 95% of the infusion thereafter were administered over the next 60 min, resulting in a total infusion time of 90 minutes. The infusion of trastuzumab followed 30 minutes after the completion of the 2B3-101 infusion.



In the breast cancer brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle equally also consisted of 21 days. On day 1 of each cycle patients received a single IV 50 mg/m2 dose of 2X-111 as single agent, or a dose of 2X-111 at the MTD of 2B3-101 in combination with trastuzumab (if different). To minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose (in mg) was infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If 2X-111 was well tolerated, the remaining 95% of the infusion was thereafter administered over the next 60 minutes, resulting in a total infusion time of 90 minutes. A trastuzumab infusion followed 30 minutes after the completion of the 2X-111 infusion, if applicable. Each treatment cycle consisted of 21 days.



In the SCLC brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle also consisted of 21 days. Patients received a single IV 50 mg/m2 dose of 2X-111 on day 1 of each cycle. To minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2X-111 (in mg) was infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion was then completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Each treatment cycle consisted of 21 days.



In the melanoma brain metastases study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle also consisted of 21 days. Patients received a single IV 50 mg/m2 dose of 2X-111 on day 1 of each cycle. To minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2X-111 (in mg) was infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion was completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Each treatment cycle consisted of 21 days.



In the recurrent malignant glioma study arm of the expansion phase, each treatment cycle consists of 28 days. Patients received a single IV 60 mg/m2 dose of 2X-111 on day 1 of each cycle. To minimize the risk of infusion reactions 5% of the total dose of 2X-111 (in mg) was infused slowly over the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusion was completed over the next hour for a total infusion time of 90 minutes. Each treatment cycle consisted of 28 days.



Infusion or hypersensitivity reactions were expected with the first or subsequent dose of 2X-111 and/or trastuzumab. In case of an infusion reaction, it was recommended to follow the below infusion scheme not only for the continued infusion but also for all future infusions with 2X-111 in the patients that experience such a reaction:




● | (Re)-start the 2X-111 infusion with 10 mL/hour for the first 15 minutes and increase the infusion rate every 15 to 30 minutes as follows: 20 mL/hour, 50 mL/hour, 100 mL/hour and finally 200 mL/hour.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition, (pre) medication such as hydrocortisone, ranitidine, cimetidine, antiemetics, and diphenhydramine in line with existing local institutional guidelines all were allowed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Patients who received 2X-111 in combination with trastuzumab participated in an intensified cardiac program including ECG, LVEF, cTnT and NT-proBNP measurements before start of every treatment cycle.

Preliminary anti-cancer activity for solid tumors was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. The preliminary anti-cancer activity for recurrent malignant gliomas was assessed according to the RANO criteria. In order to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of the treatment, appropriate imaging procedures were performed to accurately assess the tumor size at baseline, at the last day (day 21 or in case of patients with recurrent malignant glioma enrolled in the dose expansion phase day 28) of every even cycle (e.g. cycle 2, 4, 6 etc.), and at withdrawal from study treatment. Unless not done within 14 days before start of treatment the MRI of the brain was performed to assess brain lesion sizes. Unless not done within 28 days before baseline, a CT/MRI-scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed to assess solid tumor sizes. If corticosteroid treatment (e.g. dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) or increase in corticosteroid treatment was required between screening and the first cycle of 2X-111, the baseline MRI was re-performed after a minimum of 7 days of stable or decreasing doses of the corticosteroids. The first cycle of drug was not initiated until baseline MRI has been performed.



CT/MRI-scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis were only obtained from patients with solid tumors and brain metastases. These assessments were not required for patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Identified lesions were consistently followed using the unique lesion number assigned at baseline. All tumor measurements were obtained using the same diagnostic procedure used at baseline. For each course in which a tumor assessment was made, standard tumor response criteria were applied and the response for that course documented in the patient file. All identified lesions at screening/baseline were followed using the same imaging procedure. A bone scan was only obtained if clinically indicated during the study if the patient developed symptoms or signs of bone metastases. If bone metastases were known to be present at screening, bone scintigraphy was performed in addition to and at the same time as the CT/MRI-scans throughout the study. All lesions were followed during treatment (i.e. target lesions as well as non-target lesions). All CT/MRI Images from patients enrolled in the dose expansion arms of the study were sent electronically to a central repository system.

Safety was assessed by means of physical examination, neurological examination (and a brain MRI if a neurological deficit was leading to WHO> 2), weight, vital signs, ECOG performance status, MMSE, HDS, laboratory evaluations (hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis and N-terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-ProBNP) and cardiac Troponin T (cTnT)), electrocardiograms (ECG), LVEF (MUGA/ECHO)), and recording of concurrent illness/therapy and adverse events.



Clinical anti-cancer activity was assessed by best overall response (OR) by both, investigator, and computer-based methods. Overall, both methodologies reported similar results with the majority of best overall survival (OS) reported being stable diseases (SDs) while some partial responses (PRs) also being observed.



In the Dose Escalation Phase (DEP) group and in the glioma only patients, SD was the best OR recorded for 26.5% and 23.5% of the patients, as reported by the computer and investigator, respectively. At the same time, in the DEP group and for other solid tumors and across all single and combination arms, one PR (2.9%) was reported by the computer in the 2X-111 50 mg/m2 + trastuzumab group. However, this response was deemed as SD by the investigator. The rate of SDs reported for this other (non-glioma) solid tumor group, was 23.3% and 20.6% for the computer and investigator, respectively.



In the Expansion Phase (EPP) group and for the glioma patients, both the computer and the investigator methods recorded the best OR as an SD rate of 17.8%. In the solid tumors group, the same SD rate of 26.7% was reported by both methods of assessment also. In addition, PR was also reported, 2.2% by the investigator and 4.4% by the computer.

Finally, analysis of the three exploratory populations revealed that SDs are the predominant best OR. In the glioma patient group receiving 2X-111 greater or equal to 40 mg/m2, 16 out of the 27 patients experienced PD. In the breast-patient-group receiving 2X-111 greater or equal to 40 mg/m2, 2 out of 24 patients experienced PR according to the computer or investigator method of assessment, respectively and at the same time, 12 or 15 out of 24 experienced an SD. In the Her2+ breast patient group receiving 2X-111 greater or equal to 40 mg/m2 in combination with trastuzumab, 2 or 1 out of 16 patients experienced PR according to the computer or investigator method of assessment, respectively and at the same time, 10 or 12 out of 24 experienced an SD.

All patients have reported at least one treatment emergent adverse event (grade I to IV) but all of them were manageable and none of them have been considered unexpected based on the previous experience from treatment with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil/Caelyx) and/or non-clinical safety information with Allarity.



The number of infusions administered as single agent or in combination with trastuzumab to the individual patients ranged from 1 to 10. Long-term toxicity data (> 2 infusions of 2X-111) were available from 34 patients, all but one of these patients were treated with doses more or equal to 40 mg/m2. One patient has received 10 infusions. The maximum total dose of 2X-111 delivered to date is 240 mg/m2. Following treatment with 2X-111 infusion related reactions were reported in 27% of the patients in the Dose Escalation and 34% in the EPP. All infusion related reactions (dyspnea, chest pain, back pain, fatigue, headache, flushing, chills, tachycardia) that were observed in this study with 2X-111 were in between grade 1 to 3, but no grade 4 reactions. After modification of the initial infusion rate (5% given over the first 30 min and the remaining 95% over 60 min) at a dose of 30 mg/m2, infusion reaction grade 1-2 has been reduced and reported in 16 out of 68 treated patients (23%), the majority still without any premedication. In all patients experiencing an infusion reaction the infusions were continued after a shorter treatment interruption. Only one case was reported as SAE (grade 2 bronchospasm). With respect to hematological toxicity, neutropenia was observed in 40.5%, leukocytopenia in 24.3% and thrombocytopenia in 18.9% of patients in the DEP. In EPP neutropenia occurred in 31.9%, leukocytopenia in 8.5% and thrombocytopenia in 4.3% of patients. In all patients with hematologic side effects the subsequent dose has been withheld for 1-2 weeks, per protocol and in 1 case also a dose reduction by 10 mg/m2.



Palmar plantar erythrodysthesia (PPE) was reported in 45.9% of patients in DEP and 55.3% in EPP. However, no hand-foot syndrome grade 4 or 5 was reported. Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome was present in approximately 21.6% in DEP and 23.4% in EPP. While hand-foot syndrome caused by 2X-111 was reversible within one or two weeks, it caused dose delays and dose reductions in several patients. However, a favorable safety profile was observed and 2X-111 was relatively well tolerated in both patients with BCBM from solid tumors and patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.



Overview of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)



Malignant brain tumors account for approximately 190,000 new cases and 40,000 deaths per year globally. In the U.S., gliomas account for 81% of all malignant brain tumors where glioblastoma (GBM) (WHO grade IV) is the most aggressive form and represents the most prevalent (54%) form of all gliomas and 46% of all primary malignant brain tumors. The majority of GBM (95%) has histologically been classified as primary GBM mostly in elderly without any clinical history of lower grade gliomas. Secondary GBM develops from lower grade gliomas in younger patients (age <45 years) in the course of many months to years of disease. Today the distinction is based on isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations.



The prognosis of newly diagnosed GBM is poor with overall survival (OS) rates in the U.S. at 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year survival of 37.2%, 8.8%, and 5.1%, respectively. The current standard of care is tumor resection followed by radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) and then continuing with TMZ maintenance, and results in median OS of 14.6 months, which does not seem to have been relevantly improved over the past several decades. Thus, the therapeutic results are still not satisfactory, and new and more efficacious therapies are needed. Only a subgroup of GBM patients (approximately 32%), who have a methylated MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) promotor, may benefit from TMZ treatment. The MGMT gene is involved in DNA repair, and epigenetic silencing by promotor methylation has previously been shown to be associated with longer survival in patients receiving alkylating agents. It has been shown that TMZ treatment improves OS from 15.3 to 21.7 months in patients with MGMT silencing, while patients with unmethylated MGMT promotors had no significant benefit from TMZ.





66







In most GBM patients the disease will progress sooner or later, however there is no clear recommendations for second line treatment. Depending on the clinical picture of each individual patient the treatment of recurrent GBM includes a second surgical procedure with or without implantation of carmustine wafers, nitrosoureas, TMZ treatment, the VEGF-blocking antibody bevacizumab (Avastin®) alone or in combination with the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor irinotecan, and, in some countries, systemic chemotherapy (e.g. carmustine plus irinotecan). In a Danish study of bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan an overall response rate (ORR) of 30%, median PFS of 5 months, and median OS of 7.5 months was observed. However, the treatment options for recurrent GBM are limited and the prognosis is poor. Patients should therefore be encouraged to participate in clinical trials.



Rationale for Liposomal Doxorubicin in GBM



Several studies on established glioma cell lines have shown promising levels of therapeutic activity of doxorubicin. In the last decade, treatment of GBM with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®/Caelyx®) has been assessed in three small studies. The treatment has been shown to result in a modest positive effect (1.5 months) on survival. However, this effect has not been considered sufficient to justify the use of Doxil®/Caelyx® as a standard treatment option in patients with brain tumors according to treating clinicians and regulatory agencies.



Existing PEG-liposomal formulations of doxorubicin, such as Doxil®/Caelyx®, do not readily pass the BBB and therefore do not deliver sufficient levels of the drug to brain tumors in order to provide meaningful therapeutic benefit. Likewise, doxorubicin itself does not pass the BBB.



The FDA granted orphan drug designation for 2X-111 for the treatment of glioma on August 16, 2010 (FDA/103119). Additionally, on September 21, 2010, the orphan drug designation of 2X-111 for the treatment of glioma was approved by the EMA (EMA/OD/031/10).



2X-111 is a novel PEG-liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, which, by virtue of the glutathione modification on the liposomal surface, can pass the BBB and deliver therapeutically sufficient levels of doxorubicin to brain tumors. Accordingly, 2X-111 has the potential to be a new and beneficial therapeutic option for the treatment of GBM.



Rationale for Liposomal Doxorubicin in Breast Cancer (Brain Metastases)



Brain metastases are diagnosed in approximately 15% of unselected patients with advanced breast cancer. Over time, it has become increasingly clear that the biology of the primary tumor influences the pattern of metastatic spread, including the likelihood of relapse in the central nervous system (CNS). As many as half of patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer will develop brain metastases at some point in the course of their disease.



Within the HER2-positive subset, hormone receptor status appears to further define the risk of CNS relapse, with patients having hormone receptor-negative/HER2-positive tumors experiencing increased risk developing metastases in the CNS as the first site of relapses, compared with patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-positive tumors. Furthermore, patients with metastatic, triple-negative (ER, PR and HER2 negative) breast cancer are equally at high risk, with 25 – 46% of patients developing brain metastases at some point in the course of their disease. The timing of the CNS relapse also appears to vary by tumor subtype. Patients with non-luminal tumors (e.g. triple-negative cancers) appear to experience a shorter time to relapses in the CNS compared to patients with luminal tumors.



In a historical series of unselected patients with breast cancer brain metastases treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), the median survival has been reported to be approximately five to six months. More recent analyses have identified performance status of the patient and the biologic tumor subtype as major drivers of prognosis. For example, in a multi-institutional retrospective database of over 400 patients with breast cancer brain metastases, a prognostic model (the Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment, DSGPA) using these factors (plus age) was able to distinguish between patients experiencing a two-year median survival versus those with 3.4 months median survival.



Across multiple retrospective studies, the most striking differences consistently noted have been between patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (who carry the most favorable prognosis) and patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Based on several lines of evidence, it is likely that improved systemic tumor control is a major contributing factor to this difference. First, although one must interpret retrospective data cautiously because of issues with patient selection, it has been observed by multiple investigators that patients with HER2-positive tumors who continue anti-HER2 therapy following the diagnosis of brain metastases do far better than those who receive either no therapy, or chemotherapy without HER2-directed therapy. Second, as many as half of the patients with HER2-positive brain metastases die primarily from CNS progression of their disease (as opposed to systemic progression). Accordingly, the need for a brain-targeted therapy for the treatment of brain metastases is warranted in this patient population. This is distinguished from patients with triple-negative brain metastases, where patients most commonly die of uncontrolled systemic disease.

Existing PEG-liposomal formulations of doxorubicin, such as Doxil®/Caelyx®, do not readily pass the BBB and therefore do not deliver sufficient levels of the drug to brain tumors in order to provide meaningful therapeutic benefit. Likewise, doxorubicin itself does not pass the BBB.



2X-111 is a novel PEG-liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, which, by virtue of the glutathione modification on the liposomal surface, can pass the BBB and deliver therapeutically sufficient levels of doxorubicin to brain tumors. Accordingly, 2X-111 has the potential to a new and beneficial therapeutic option for the treatment of brain metastases of breast cancer.



Future Opportunities & Development Plans for 2X-111



In June of 2020, we out-licensed our 2X-111 program to Smerud Medical Research International, our long-time CRO partner in Europe, which was subsequently terminated on March 28, 2022. Allarity, SMERUD, and original drug owner 2BBB Medicines, B.V. are currently negotiating a revised agreement under which SMERUD will secure grant funding to advance this program, with DRP® companion diagnostic support from Allarity. 



DRP® Companion Diagnostic for 2X-111



We anticipate that 2X-111 will be developed together with our retrospectively validated DRP® companion diagnostic for doxorubicin, which enables us to select the patients most likely to respond to the drug in our clinical trials. The FDA has previously approved our IDE applications for use of our DRP® companion diagnostics in clinical trials of two of our priority programs: Stenoparib and LiPlaCis®. Accordingly, we are confident the FDA will approve an eventual IDE for our Doxorubicin-DRP® companion diagnostic for U.S. clinical trials of 2X-111. The Doxorubicin-DRP®, which comprises 299 expressed genes, was initially developed using gene expression data from the National Cancer Institute NCI60 cancer cell lines panel.



The putative Doxorubicin-DRP®, developed through our DRP® platform using gene expression data from cancer cell line testing data, was retrospectively validated using biopsy materials from the screening of breast cancer patients for our LiPlaCis® trial (clinicaltrial.gov number NCT01861496). A total of 140 patients received epirubicin and were included in the analysis. The study population was diagnosed with primary BC between 1986 and 2015 and received epirubicin in the locally advanced or metastatic setting between May 1997 and November 2016. The hazard ratio for DRP scores differing by 50 percentage points was 0.55 (95% CI –0.93, one-sided). The results were published in Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2018 Aug 11.



In sum, our retrospectively validated Doxorubicin-DRP® companion diagnostic correctly identifies responder patients to 2X-111 and we expect this DRP® companion diagnostic will be used for all clinical programs to advance 2X-111.



Existing Liposomal Doxorubicin Drugs & Our Opportunity



There has not been a therapeutically meaningful new drug for the treatment of GBM since bevacizumab (Avastin®) was approved, by the FDA, in 2009 as a monotherapy for patients who have progressed on prior therapy. Prior to introduction of bevacizumab in the GBM treatment landscape, TMZ was approved, by the FDA in 2005, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance treatment. Nearly 20 years later, TMZ remains the only front-line therapy for GBM, and its effectiveness is limited. Similarly, the effectiveness of benefit of second-line therapeutic bevacizumab remains limited. Accordingly, there is pressing need for new and innovative therapies for the treatment of this aggressive and incurable cancer.





68







There is no currently approved, available therapy for the treatment of brain metastases of breast cancer, and these metastases remain fatal to breast cancer patients. Accordingly, there is pressing need for new and innovative therapies for the treatment of this aggressive and incurable metastatic cancer.



Worldwide annual sales TMZ exceeded $1 billion annually in 2009. The global GBM drugs market to projected to reach nearly $1.8 billion by 2027, expanding at a CAGR of 12.8% during the forecast period, driven by rising geriatric population, growing incidence cases and clinical pipeline of new products. The global breast cancer therapeutics market has been valued at over $19 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach over $40 billion by the year 2026, at a CAGR of 10.6%. Since an estimated 10-15% of breast cancer patients will develop brain metastases, which are fatal, the estimated annual market for new therapeutics to treat such brain metastases will exceed $4 billion by 2026.



While there are several approved PEG-liposomal doxorubicin formulations (e.g. Doxil®/Caelyx®) currently marketed for the treatment of numerous cancer, including breast cancer, these drugs do not pass the BBB. There are currently no approved, targeted liposomal formulations of doxorubicin on the market that are capable of passing the BBB and therefore treating both primary and secondary brain tumors. Accordingly, 2X-111 has the potential to be a novel, beneficial product with the potential, together with its DRP® companion diagnostic, to gain substantial market share not only in GBM and breast cancer (brain metastases) but as a new therapy for the numerous other primary and second brain tumors.



Overview of Our Prior Therapeutic Candidate Irofulven (DNA damaging agent) and Our Out-licensed Putative DRP® Companion Diagnostic



Mechanisms of Action



Irofulven (6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene) is a unique DNA damaging agent that is a semi-synthetic sesquiterpene derivative of illudin S, a natural toxin isolated from the Jack O’lantern mushroom (Omphalotus illudens). Irofulven has two primary anti-tumor mechanisms of action: first, it produces bulky single strand DNA adducts that are only repairable by the transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway; and second, it stalls RNA polymerase II leading to transcription and cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.



Irofulven is a prodrug. The active metabolite is created by the reduction of the unsaturated α−β ketone by the NADPH-dependent Prostaglandin Reductase 1 (PTGR1). This metabolite is unstable and highly reactive, binding to either protein or DNA. The DNA binding is primarily to the 3-N of deoxyadenosine (98%) with the remainder binding to 7-N deoxyguanine. The resulting bulky single strand adducts can cause single strand DNA breaks and S-phase double strand DNA breaks. The GG-NER, BER and MMR pathways do not detect or remove Irofulven-DNA adducts, which either persist into, or are created during, S-phase of cancer cell duplication and create double strand DNA breaks which may be repaired by Homologous Recombination.



Irofulven is more active in vitro against tumor cells of epithelial origin and is more resistant than other alkylating agents to deactivation by p53 loss and MDR15. Irofulven showed impressive anticancer results in xenograft models, shows synergy with topoisomerase I inhibitors, and has demonstrated activity against cell lines that are resistant to other therapies. Irofulven has significant scope for combination with other therapies, including PARP inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. PD-1 inhibitors) and standard chemotherapeutic regimes, and is synergistic with other therapies targeting the TC-NER pathway and other DNA damage pathways.



Irofulven causes apoptosis in sensitive tumor cell lines. Activation of caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9 has been well documented in Irofulven-treated tumor cell lines. Irofulven also causes upregulation of ATM/Chk2 and ATR-dependent FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination. In all cases, however, the functional linkage(s) between irofulven adducts (both DNA and protein) and subsequent pathway activation steps are, at present, not fully understood.





69







DRP®-Guided Phase 2 Clinical Trial



Prior to July 23, 2021, and our sale of Irofulven to Lantern Pharma, Inc., we commenced a DRP®-guided Phase 2 clinical trial of Irofulven in androgen receptor (AR)-targeted and Docetaxel-Pre-treated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) patients using our putative Irofulven-DRP® companion diagnostic to select and treat patients most likely to respond to the drug (study SMR-365). This trial was not completed and was an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study in patients with docetaxel and AR-targeted therapy pre-treated mCRPC. Up to 27 mCRPC patients with predicted high probability of response to Irofulven (as determined by the Irofulven-DRP® companion diagnostic) were included. A high likelihood of Irofulven response was defined as a patient having an Irofulven-DRP® score of >80%. This study was suspended in 2019 when we internally deprioritized Irofulven. We had previously developed and patented a putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven, which we believe enables us to identify and treat the patients most likely to respond to this therapeutic candidate although we have not yet filed a PMA with the FDA for this companion diagnostic. To devote more of our development resources to our priority therapeutic candidates, on July 23, 2021, we terminated our drug development agreement for Irofulven and sold our inventory of Irofulven active pharmaceutical ingredients, (“API”), our clinical data and records (“Data”), and our know-how relating to Irofulven to Lantern Pharma, and granted a non-exclusive license to use our putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven. Although we may be entitled to future milestone payments and royalties if Lantern Pharma advances the development of Irofulven with or without our putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven, we will no longer devote any of our development resources to advance this therapeutic candidate.

Overview of Our PRP® (Patient Response Predictor)



Collections of drug specific putative DRP® companion diagnostics can be grouped together to form a panel of putative DRP® companion diagnostics that we believe can help guide therapeutic decision making for a given patient, in a true personalized medicine approach. For example, putative DRP® companion diagnostics for a number of cancer drugs with a similar mechanism-of-action, for example chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, and irofulven can be grouped together, by drug type (e.g. DNA damaging agents) in a panel to help identify which of these chemotherapeutics is most likely to benefit a particular patient. Similarly, putative DRP® companion diagnostics for a number of cancer drugs with differing mechanism-of-action, such as fulvestrant, cisplatin, and dovitinib, can be grouped together, by cancer type (e.g. drugs that treat metastatic breast cancer) in a panel to help identify which of these drugs is most likely to benefit a particular patient. We call such panels of putative DRP® companion diagnostics Patient Response Predictors (PRP®s).



We believe PRP®s, once approved, have the potential to achieve the true promise of personalized cancer care, specifically to pre-screen a given cancer patient for their likelihood of responding to a range of therapeutic options, then selecting the drug(s) most likely to benefit that patient, while avoiding the prescription of therapeutics that are not likely to benefit that patient. In practice, the treating oncologist and/or cancer center would provide us with a tumor biopsy from a given patient (or gene expression data from such biopsy) and we would then run a PRP® analysis, as requested by the oncologist, resulting in a PRP® report, provided to the oncologist and the patient, identifying the therapy options most likely to benefit the patient. This report would be somewhat analogous to currently marketed predictive diagnostic panels and reports, such as FoundationOne® (Foundation Medicine, Inc.), but with a different underlying technology base and therapeutic response predictive power.





71







An example of such a PRP® product for multiple myeloma was published in 2018 where the sensitivity of 67 patients to 14 drugs was predicted. A.J. Vangsted et al., Gene 644 80-86)



We continue to explore the strategic and market potential of such PRP® panels. Market introduction and penetration of such personalized medicine diagnostic tests and reports is challenging and subject to close scrutiny of regulatory agencies such as the FDA, and also are very capital intensive to develop, bring to market, and expand sales. Accordingly, development of a potential PRP® product and business is not currently part of our priority strategy.



Intellectual Property



Our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other major oncology markets and countries for our investigational products and our DRP® companion diagnostics, to operate without being subject to the enforcement of third-party patents and proprietary rights, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by (1) filing, in the U.S. and certain other regions/countries (include the EU), patent applications intended to cover our DRP® companion diagnostics and their use with a particular therapeutic to guide patient therapy decision making, and maintaining any DRP® pending patent applications and issued patents in our major markets; (2) maintaining and advancing, and where possible expanding, existing patents and patent applications covering the composition-of-matter of our investigational products, their methods of use and related discoveries, their formulations and methods of manufacture, and related technologies, inventions and improvements that may be commercially important to our business; and (3) filing, in the U.S. and certain other regions/countries, new patent applications on novel therapeutic uses of our investigational products, alone or together with their DRP® companion diagnostics. We may also rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, and which are difficult to reverse engineer. We also intend to take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.



We have investigational products, and putative DRP® companion diagnostics, for a number of therapeutic targets, although none of our companion diagnostics have yet received FDA or other regulatory agency approval. As of the date of this report, our Company-owned patent portfolio consists of:




● | 17 DRP® companion diagnostics patents granted covering 70 different cancer drugs, including 8 issued patents in the U.S. and 4 issued patents in the EU. Our issued patents cover, among others, DRP® companion diagnostics for Dovitinib, LiPlaCis®, 2X-111, and Irofulven. Our issued patent portfolio includes patents granted in the U.S., EU, China, Japan, Canada, and Australia.

● | The term of any patents that issue from our company-owned (or in-licensed) U.S. and foreign patent applications will vary in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and available patent term extension but is typically 20 years from the earliest priority application filing date. Expiration dates for certain patents covering our portfolio assets ranges between 2028 and 2032. Expiration dates for the DRP® companion diagnostic patents that cover our current pipeline programs will typically expire between 2030 and 2040. Any patents that may issue in the future from our company-owned (or in-licensed) pending patent applications are projected to expire between 2031 and 2041, unless extended or otherwise adjusted. Generally, the older and more developed the drug program the earlier the patent portfolio on the product will expire. For example, remaining patent portfolio term for dovitinib is less than remaining patent term for stenoparib. Such product patent portfolio expiration is independent from continuing patent coverage provided by DRP® companion diagnostics for each product.

License Agreement with Novartis Pharma for Dovitinib 



On April 6, 2018, Allarity Therapeutics Europe ApS (“Allarity Europe”), our wholly owned subsidiary, in-licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to all therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses related to cancer in humans for dovitinib from Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) pursuant to a license agreement. Upon execution of the agreement, Allarity Europe paid Novartis a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment of $1 million. Pursuant to the agreement, we are solely responsible for the development of dovitinib during the term of the agreement. The agreement also contemplated that a convertible promissory note in the amount of $1 million would also be issued to Novartis by one of our subsidiaries but was unenforceable due to the operation of the liability limitation provisions of the license agreement. As part of current discussions with Novartis over the possible restructuring of the milestone payments described below, the parties entered into an amendment to the license agreement on April 12, 2022, to be effective as of March 30, 2022, to exclude the convertible promissory note from the liability limitation provisions of the license agreement and, subject to the parties execution of the amendment to the license agreement, our subsidiary executed an enforceable convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1 million with a maturity date of April 6, 2025 (the “Novartis Promissory Note”). The Novartis Promissory Note will bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum commencing on April 6, 2018, which shall be paid, together with the principal amount, on the maturity date. The Novartis Promissory Note was issued by Allarity Therapeutics Denmark ApS (“Allarity Denmark”), a wholly owned special purpose vehicle of our subsidiary Allarity Europe, the licensee under the license agreement. In the event that there is a change of control, as defined under the Novartis Promissory Note, of Allarity Europe, Novartis would be entitled to a payment equal to 5% of the first $30 million we receive in connection with the change of control and up to 3% of any amounts we receive in excess of $30 million in connection with the change of control. In addition, in the event Allarity Denmark undertakes an initial public offering (“IPO”) resulting in its shares being listed on an internationally recognized securities exchange, then Novartis would have a one-time right to convert all amounts owed under the Novartis Promissory Note into 3% of Allarity Denmark outstanding equity securities immediately before the IPO.
Development Milestone Payments



Pursuant to the agreement, as amended on September 27, 2022, Allarity Europe has agreed to make milestone payments to Novartis in connection with the development of dovitinib by us or our affiliates, or by a third-party (a “Program Acquirer”) that assumes control of the dovitinib development program from us corresponding to: (i) upon enrollment of half of the patients required in a Phase 2 clinical trials in certain countries in accordance with agreed upon protocols; (ii) upon dosing of the first patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial; (iii) upon submission of the first NDA with the FDA; (iv) submission of a first application or submission for approval to market a pharmaceutical product (“MAA”) to the EMA or any other Regulatory Authority in certain countries; (v) upon receipt of the first authorization by the FDA to market and sell a licensed product; and (vi) upon receipt of a first MAA (including a respective pricing and reimbursement approval) for a licensed product in one or more specified European countries. If all milestones have been achieved, we may be obligated to pay Novartis up to a maximum of $26.5 million. As of December 31, 2021, prior to the September 27, 2022, amendment, we accrued a $5 million royalty payment due to Novartis as a current liability relating to the submission of our NDA to the FDA for the treatment of mRCC. The September 27, 2022, amendment restructured the payment terms of this milestone payment into an installment plan with the final installment due in 2023, allowing us more time to make the milestone payment in exchange for a $500,000 increase in the amount of the milestone payment. In the event that we complete a Financing Transaction, as defined in the amendment, the installment payments would be accelerated.

License Agreement with Eisai for Stenoparib



On July 6, 2017, we in-licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to all preventative, therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses related to cancer in humans and by amendment to the agreement on December 11, 2020, viral infections in humans (including, but not limited to, coronavirus vaccines and other treatments) for stenoparib from Eisai Inc. (“Eisai”) pursuant to a license agreement. Upon the execution of the agreement in 2017, we paid Eisai a one-time, non-refundable, and non-creditable payment of $1 million. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are solely responsible for the development of stenoparib during the term of the agreement. The agreement also provides for a joint development committee consisting of six members, three appointed by us and three appointed by Eisai. One of our members of the joint development committee is designated chair of the committee and has the power to break any deadlock in decisions by the committee that must be made by a majority vote with each representative having one vote. The purpose of the committee is to implement and oversee development activities for stenoparib pursuant to the clinical development plan and serve as a forum for exchanging data, information, and development strategy.
Development Milestone Payments



Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to make milestone payments to Eisai in connection with the development of stenoparib by us or our affiliates, or by a third-party (a “Program Acquirer”) that assumes control of the stenoparib development program from us corresponding to: (i) successful completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial; (ii) dosing of the first patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial; (iii) submission of the first NDA with the FDA; (iv) submission of an MAA to the EMA; (v) submission of an NDA to the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare of Japan, or the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan, or any successor thereto (the “MHLW”); (vi) receipt of authorization by the FDA to market and sell a licensed product; (vii) receipt of approval of an MAA by the EMA for a licensed pro)uct; and (viii) receipt of approval by the MHLW in Japan for a licensed product. If all milestones have been achieved, we may be obligated to pay Eisai up to a maximum of $94 million.

We are obligated to pay royalties under the agreement on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis for a period that commences with the first commercial sale of a product until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of any licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country; or, (ii) the expiration of regulatory-based exclusivity for such licensed product in such country or (iii) the 15 year anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. However, the agreement may be sooner terminated without cause by us upon 120 days prior written notice, or upon written notice of a material breach of the agreement by Eisai that is not cured within 90 days (30 days for a payment default). Eisai also has the right to terminate the agreement upon written notice of a material breach of the agreement by us that is not cured within 90 days (30 days for a payment default) or if we file for bankruptcy. By an amendment effective as of August 3, 2021, and executed by Eisai on August 23, 2021, Eisai also had the right to terminate the agreement if we did not complete a Phase 2 clinical trial before December 31, 2022, unless we elected to pay a $1 million extension payment (“Extension Payment”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event we failed to enroll and dose at least 30 patients with the first dose of cancer drug in the ongoing Phase 2 Ovarian Cancer Clinical Trial by July 1, 2022, then the Extension Payment would have become due and payable in full on July 30, 2022.

We have paid the initial $100,000 of the Extension Payment and have until April 1, 2023, to pay the remaining $900,000. Consequently, if we fail to pay the remaining $900,000 of the Extension Payment on or before April 1, 2023, or if we fail to achieve successful completion of a Phase 1b or Phase 2 Clinical Trial prior to April 1, 2024, then Eisai may terminate the agreement in its sole discretion pursuant to the terms of the amendment.



Option to Reacquire Rights to Stenoparib



For the period of time commencing with enrollment of the first five patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial pursuant to the clinical development plan and ending 90 days following successful completion of such Phase 2 clinical trial, Eisai has the option to reacquire our licensed rights to develop stenoparib for a purchase price equal to the fair market value of our rights, giving effect to the stage of development of stenoparib that we have completed under the agreement. We commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial in April 2019 and as of the date of this report, Eisai has not indicated an intention to exercise its repurchase option.

Drug License and Development Agreement for Irofulven



From May 2015 until July 23, 2021, we in-licensed various rights to Irofulven from Lantern Pharma, Inc. pursuant to a drug license and development agreement.





78







Pursuant to the agreement, we were responsible for the development of Irofulven pursuant to a defined clinical development plan. The agreement also provides for a joint development committee, including representatives from Lantern Pharma and us, to regularly discuss, plan and inform the development of products under the agreement. In 2018, we commenced a DRP®-guided Phase 2 clinical trial of Irofulven in androgen receptor (AR)-targeted and Docetaxel-Pre-treated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) patients using our putative Irofulven-DRP® companion diagnostic to select and treat patients most likely to respond to the drug (study SMR-365). This trial was not completed and was an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study in patients with docetaxel and AR-targeted therapy pre-treated mCRPC. Up to 27 mCRPC patients with predicted high probability of response to Irofulven (as determined by the Irofulven-DRP® companion diagnostic) were included. A high likelihood of Irofulven response was defined as a patient having an Irofulven-DRP® score of >80%. This study was suspended in 2019, when we deprioritized Irofulven as a therapeutic candidate in order to devote more of our development resources to our priority therapeutic candidates, and on July 23, 2021, we terminated our drug development agreement for Irofulven and sold our inventory of API, our clinical data and records, and our manufacturing know-how relating to Irofulven to Lantern Pharma, and granted a non-exclusive license to Lantern Pharma to use our putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven. Although we may be entitled to future milestone payments and royalties if Lantern Pharma advances the development of Irofulven with or without our putative DRP® companion diagnostic specific for Irofulven, we will no longer devote any of our development resources to advance this therapeutic candidate.



Asset Purchase Agreement between Allarity Therapeutics A/S and Lantern Pharma, Inc. for Irofulven



On July 23, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Lantern Pharma, Inc. relating to our inventory of Irofulven active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), our clinical research data relating to Irofulven developed by us during the drug development program under the May 2015 Drug License and Development Agreement for Irofulven (the “Data”) and terminated our obligation to further advance the development of Irofulven under the May 2015 agreement. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Lantern Pharma agreed to pay us $1 million on closing of the transaction, and additional amounts (i) when the inventory of Irofulven API is recertified with a longer shelf life; (ii) upon the initiation of treatment of the first patient in an investigator-led “compassionate use” ERCC2/3 mutation subgroup study using Irofulven in certain agreed upon investigators; (iii) upon the first to occur of (x) initiation of treatment of the first patient within an agreed upon time period after the closing of the transaction in any human clinical trial of Irofulven initiated by Lantern Pharma for regulatory purposes, and (y) initiation of treatment of the 26th patient in any human clinical trial of Irofulven after the closing of the transaction initiated by Lantern Pharma or under the investigator-led study; and (iv) upon the initiation of treatment of the second patient within an agreed upon time period after the closing of the transaction in any human clinical trial of Irofulven initiated by Lantern Pharma. In addition to the sale of our inventory of Irofulven API and Data to Lantern Pharma, we also granted Lantern Pharma a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use our putative Irofulven DRP® companion diagnostic to advance the development and commercialization of Irofulven and other Illudins (sesquiterpenes with anti-tumor properties produced by some mushrooms). We have also agreed not to engage in any drug development program for Illudins or any of its analogues or any use thereof for a period of five years.
Milestone Payments



Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we would also be entitled to receive certain milestone payments relating to our out-licensed putative Irofulven DRP® companion diagnostic upon the occurrence of the following events: (i) upon the first use of our putative Irofulven DRP® companion diagnostic in a clinical trial for Irofulven; and (ii) upon the first regulatory approval of our putative Irofulven DRP® companion diagnostic as a companion diagnostic for use with an approved drug. In addition to the milestone payments relating to our putative Irofulven DRP® companion diagnostic, we would also be entitled to receive certain milestone payments relating to the development and commercialization of Irofulven upon the occurrence of the following events: (i) upon the first filing for regulatory approval for commercialization of Irofulven in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy, or upon the first and second filings for regulatory approval for commercialization of Irofulven in countries located in the European Union that are not Germany, France or Italy; (ii) upon the first filing for regulatory approval for commercialization of Irofulven in the United States; (iii) upon receiving the first regulatory approval for commercialization of Irofulven in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy, or upon the first and second receipts for regulatory approval for commercialization of Irofulven in countries located in the European Union that are not Germany, France or Italy, (iv) upon receiving the first regulatory approval for commercialization of Irofulven in the United States. If all milestones have been achieved, then we would be entitled to receive up to $16 million in milestone payments under the Asset Purchase Agreement.

License Agreement with 2-BBB Medicines B.V. for 2X-111



On March 27, 2017, we in-licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to the central nervous system (“CNS”) and/or cerebrocardiovascular drug application, including the (preventive) treatment of peripheral effects of agents causing CNS disease or symptoms, including cancer, for 2X-111 from 2-BBB Medicines B.V. (“2-BBB”) pursuant to a license agreement. Upon execution of the agreement, we paid 2-BBB a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable payment of $500,000. Pursuant to the agreement, we are solely responsible for the development of 2X-111 during the term of the agreement.



Development and Sales Milestone Payments



Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to make milestone payments to 2-BBB in connection with the development of 2X-111 by us or our affiliates, or by a third-party (a “Program Acquirer”) that assumes control of the 2X-111 development program from us corresponding to: (i) enrollment of the first ten patients required in a Phase 2 clinical trial; (ii) the successful completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial; (iii) dosing of the first patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial; (iv) submission of the first NDA with the FDA; (v) submission of an MAA to the EMA in the European Union; (vi) submission of an NDA in the first of either China or India; (vii) receipt of the first authorization by the FDA to market and sell a licensed product; (viii) receipt of a MAA for a licensed product in the European Union; and (ix) receipt of regulatory approval in the first of either China or India. If all development milestones have been achieved, we may be obligated to pay 2-BBB up to a maximum of $27.75 million which could increase to $55.5 million if 2-BBB successfully expands the field of our license agreement to include all preventative, therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses related to cancer in humans. In addition to the development milestones described above, we have agreed to make a mid-level seven figure one-time payment upon our sales of a licensed product reaching $500 million annually and a low eight figure payment upon the first and second time our sales of a licensed product reaches $1 billion annually. If all sales milestones have been achieved, we would be obligated to pay 2-BBB up to a maximum of $22.5 million which could increase to $45 million if 2-BBB successfully expands the field of our license agreement to include all preventative, therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses related to cancer in humans.
Royalty Payments



In addition to the milestone payments described above, we have agreed to pay 2-BBB royalties based on annual incremental sales of product derived from 2X-111 in an amount between 5% and 10% of annual sales of between $0 and $100 million, between 6% and 13% of annual sales between $100 million and $250 million, and between 7% and 13% of annual sales in excess of $250 million. We are obligated to pay royalties under the agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, from the period of time commencing on the first commercial sale of any product in such country and expiring upon the latest of (a) the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent within (i) the 2-BBB intellectual property and/or (ii) the joint intellectual property in such country (if, but only if, such joint intellectual property arose from activities under the clinical development plan), or (b) the 10th anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country. However, the agreement may be sooner terminated without cause by us upon 120 days prior written notice, or upon written notice of a material breach of the agreement by 2-BBB that is not cured within 90 days. 2-BBB also has the right to terminate the agreement upon written notice of a material breach of the agreement by us that is not cured within 90 days (30 days for a payment default) or if we file for bankruptcy. 2-BBB also has the right to terminate the agreement in the event we challenge a 2-BBB patent and we have the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice for specified safety reason.

Out-License Agreement with SMERUD



In June of 2020, we out-licensed our secondary LiPlaCis® and 2X-111 programs to Smerud Medical Research International, our long-time CRO partner in Europe, for further Phase 2 clinical development of each program together with its DRP® companion diagnostic. On March 28, 2022, we restructured our LiPlaCis® license agreements with Smerud and original drug owner LiPlasome Pharma ApS, in a way that will enable Smerud to step into the shoes of Allarity and assume full control of this program for further development in a Smerud affiliated subsidiary, Chosa ApS, and to secure additional investment funding and collaborative development of the program through the affiliate. Pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement (as described below in the section titled “LiPlaCis Support Agreement with Smerud, Chosa and LiPlasome”) and in connection with the termination of our exclusive licensee rights to LiPlaCis® under the Amended License Agreement (as described below in the section titled “Amended and Restated License Agreement with LiPlasome Pharma ApS for LiPlaCis®”), we agreed to terminate our out-license agreement with SMERUD. However, notwithstanding the termination of the out-license agreement, we are currently engaged in discussions with Smerud in connection with the further development of 2X-111.



Amended and Restated License Agreement with LiPlasome Pharma ApS for LiPlaCis®



In January 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with LiPlasome Pharma ApS (“LiPlasome”) for the perpetual, exclusive, world-wide rights to develop, use and market LiPlaCis® for any indication which superseded all prior license and development agreements between us and LiPlasome (the “Original License Agreement”). On March 28, 2022, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement which assigned, amended and restated the Original License Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to replace Allarity Europe with Chosa, an affiliate of Smerud, as exclusive licensee to further advance clinical development and commercialization of LiPlaCis® (the “Amended License Agreement”). Under the Amended License Agreement, Chosa replaced Allarity Europe as the exclusive licensee to the LiPlaCis® technology. In addition, Allarity Europe also granted Chosa an exclusive, royalty-free, transferable and sublicensable license for (i) its DRP® Companion Diagnostics that are specific for Cisplatin or LiPlaCis® for the research and development of LiPlaCis® products, and (ii) the use of any and all know-how and intellectual property rights owned by Allarity Europe for Chosa’s use of our DRP® Companion Diagnostics that are specific for Cisplatin or LiPlaCis® for the development and commercialization of LiPlaCis® products, as contemplated in the Amended License Agreement.



Development Milestone Payments



Pursuant to the Amended License Agreement, Allarity Europe is entitled to receive certain milestone payments from Chosa relating to the development and commercialization of LiPlaCis® upon the occurrence of the following events, which milestone payments are to be shared with LiPlasome: (i) receipt of first regulatory approval of a product in the United States, (ii) receipt of first regulatory approval of a product in any country in Europe, including on a centralized filing basis by the EMA, (iii) the first achievement on a cumulative basis of net sales of a product in the United States, and (iv) the first achievement on a cumulative basis of net sales of a product in any country in Europe. Each milestone payment is payable one time only, regardless of the number of times the corresponding milestone event is achieved by a product and regardless of the number of products to achieve such milestone event. If all milestones are achieved, then we would be entitled to receive up to $3.5 million in milestone payments under the Amended License Agreement.



As a result of the Amended License Agreement, we no longer have any rights to use or commercialize LiPlaCis® and are only entitled to receive the milestone payments upon the achievement of the respective milestones.



LiPlaCis Support Agreement with Smerud, Chosa and LiPlasome



On March 28, 2022, and concurrent with the entry into the Amended License Agreement, we entered into the LiPlaCis Support Agreement with Allarity Europe, Smerud, Chosa and LiPlasome (the “Support Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement, we agreed (i) to pay to LiPlasome a certain percentage of the Commercialization Proceeds (as defined under the Original License Agreement) we received from Smerud by way of debt cancellation relating to prior work on LiPlaCis® by Smerud, which obligation was to be satisfied by the payment of 2,273,020 Danish Kroner to LiPlasome upon execution of the Support Agreement, (ii) to equally share the milestone payments under the terms of the Amended License Agreement, pursuant to which it was contemplated that upon the achievement of all the milestones, our pro rata share of the milestone payments would be up to $3.5 million, (iii) to amend and restate the Original License Agreement, and (iv) to terminate the Out-License Agreement with SMERUD as contemplated by the parties pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement.

Manufacturing and Supply



We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our investigational products for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our investigational products obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational products, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our investigational products.



To date, we have obtained APIs and drug product for our investigational products from either the original drug owner/licensee or from single-source third-party clinical manufacturing organizations (CMOs). We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our investigational products and intend to put in place framework agreements under which CMOs will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs, and which agreements will provide us with intellectual property rights necessary to conduct the business. We may use a different CMO for each investigational product and will consider further diversification of drug product and supply organizations as circumstances warrant. Overall, as we advance our investigational products through development, we will start by seeking multiple sources for raw materials and address other potential points in concern over time.



Commercialization



We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our investigational products and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our investigational products on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the U.S. and other regions, either globally or on a region-by-region basis. We do not intend to build the necessary infrastructure and sales, marketing and commercial product distribution capabilities for the U.S., and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our investigational products. We instead prefer to build appropriate partnerships with marketing, sales, and distribution partners to effect launch and market penetration for each of our therapeutic programs. However, as we near approval and commercial launch of each program, we will assess the suitability of marketing and sales partners and reserve the right to potentially develop and implement our own infrastructure to support the commercial success of our programs. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population and the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs and economics related to the foregoing may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Competition



The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer therapies. Any investigational products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. Similarly, our core DRP® platform technology, and any drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostics that we develop and commercialize, will compete with new companion diagnostic technologies that may become available in the future.



We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop small molecules and drug conjugates, together with companion diagnostics, as treatments for cancer patients. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing such treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), Merck, Pfizer in partnership with Merck KGaA, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in partnership with Sanofi Genzyme (“Sanofi”) and Roche. There are also many other companies that are developing, have developed, and/or have commercialized patient-selective, companion diagnostic technologies/approaches for cancer patients, such as Foundation Medicine, Inc., Kura Oncology, Inc., and Lantern Pharma, Inc.



For our Dovitinib program, we are aware of a number of companies that are currently marketing approved pan-TKIs and/or developing pan-TKIs that are or may be competitive to our drug, such as Big Pharma companies Eisai, Bayer, Pfizer, Novartis, and smaller pharmaceutical players Exelixis, Mirati Therapeutics, and Aveo Oncology. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved or in development pan-TKI, for the treatment of RCC or other indications, that has an identical therapeutic profile to dovitinib, with or without its Dovitinib-DRP® companion diagnostic.





82







For our Stenoparib program, we are aware of a number of companies that are currently marketing approved PARP inhibitors and/or developing PARP inhibitors that are or may be competitive to our drug, such as Big Pharma companies AstraZeneca, BMS, Novartis, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and smaller pharmaceutical players BeiGene and Clovis Oncology. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved or in development PARP inhibitor, for the treatment of ovarian cancer or other indications, that has an identical therapeutic profile to stenoparib, with or without its Stenoparib-DRP® companion diagnostic.



For our IXEMPRA® program, we are aware of a number of companies that are currently marketing approved microtubule inhibitors and/or developing microtubule inhibitors that are or may be competitive to our drug, such as Big Pharma companies Eisai and Sanofi, and smaller pharmaceutical players like Celgene and Veru Pharma. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved or in development microtubule inhibitor, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (mBC) or other indications, that has an identical therapeutic profile to IXEMPRA®, with or without its IXEMPRA®-DRP® companion diagnostic.



For our LiPlaCis® program, we are aware of a number of companies that are currently or have been developing liposomal formulations of cisplatin that are or may be competitive to our drug, such as Regulon, Inc. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved liposomal formulation of cisplatin. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there is no in development liposomal formulation of cisplatin, for the treatment of mBC or other indications, that has an identical therapeutic profile to LiPlaCis®, with or without its Cisplatin-DRP® companion diagnostic.



For our 2X-111 program, we are aware of a number of companies that are currently marketing approved liposomal formulations of doxorubicin and/or developing liposomal formulations of doxorubicin that are or may be competitive to our drug, such as Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Baxter, and Teva, and Zydus Cadilla. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved or in development Glutathione-modified liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, for the treatment of GBM or other indications, that has an identical therapeutic profile to 2X-111, with or without its Doxorubicin-DRP® companion diagnostic.



For our Irofulven-DRP® companion diagnostic that we have out-licensed to Lantern Pharma, we are aware of a number of companies that are currently marketing approved DNA damaging chemotherapeutics and/or developing DNA damaging chemotherapeutics that are or may be competitive to Irofulven. Many approved chemotherapeutics are now generic and sold by companies such as Teva Pharmaceuticals and Baxter. Some smaller pharmaceutical companies, such as Alkido Pharma and Lantern Pharma, are attempting to develop novel chemotherapeutics. Lantern Pharma, for example, is pre-clinically attempting to develop novel analogues of Irofulven. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved or in development DNA damaging agent, for the treatment of mCRPC or other indications, that has an identical therapeutic profile to Irofulven, with or without its Irofulven-DRP® companion diagnostic.



For our core DRP® platform technology (and its resulting drug specific DRP® companion diagnostics), we are aware of a number of companies that are currently marketing approved companion diagnostic platforms, or are attempting to develop such platforms, that are or may be competitive to (although distinct from) our DRP® platform, such as Foundation Medicine and Lantern Pharma. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved or developmental diagnostic technology or platform — for the development of drug-specific companion diagnostics to guide selection and treatment of cancer patients most likely to respond to a given drug — that is as broadly applicable, robust, and highly validated as our DRP® platform.



Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.



We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize therapeutic products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Similarly, it is possible that our commercial opportunity may be reduced by the development and commercialization of competing companion diagnostic products that are superior to our DRP® companion diagnostics. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our investigational products, if approved, are likely to be their degree of anti-cancer activity, tolerability profile, convenience and price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics (if required), the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. All these factors will be impacted by the value and superiority of our DRP® companion diagnostics over any competing companion diagnostic approaches that currently exist or evolve in the oncology market.

Government Regulation



Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state, and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. Similar regulations and approvals exist in the EU and other major oncology therapeutic markets.
U.S. Drug Development



In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Similarly, in the European Union (EU), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulates the clinical trial, approval, and marketing of drugs. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. or EU requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s or EMA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.



Our therapeutic candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application (“NDA”), and similarly by the EMA under an equivalent process, before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process generally involves the following:




● | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become approved and effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, which must become approved and effective before a drug-specific DRP® companion diagnostic can be used in human clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related protocols and regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application to allow use of a DRP® companion diagnostic on the market together with its approved drug;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






84








● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: pre-clinical and clinical. The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future therapeutic candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all, whether in the U.S, EU, or other region/country.



Pre-Clinical Studies and IND/IDE



The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, retrospective data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Similarly, and IDE is a request for authorization from the FDA to use a diagnostic — in our case a DRP® companion diagnostic — to screen, select, and treat specific patients in a human clinical trial.



Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of pre-clinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, retrospective data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Similarly, an IDE sponsor must submit information about the prior development and validation of the diagnostic, including results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, retrospective data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IDE. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Similarly, submission of an IDE for a DRP® companion diagnostic may not result in the FDA allowing use of such DRP® in an approved clinical trial.



Clinical Trials



The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB must also approve the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Clinical development in other major oncology markets, such as the EU, is subject to similar requirements and regulations.





85







A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well-designed and well conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP and. the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary. An NDA based solely on foreign clinical data meeting U.S. criteria for marketing approval may be approved if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and (3) the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection or other appropriate means, if deemed necessary.



Clinical trials in the U.S. generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.




● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the therapeutic candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability, and safety of the drug. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Clinical development in other major oncology markets, such as the EU, is subject to similar requirements and regulations.



Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.





86







Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal safety studies and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our therapeutic candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our therapeutic candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life.



NDA Review Process



Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug in the U.S. for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug. Concomitantly, a PMA is submitted to the FDA as part of NDA approval that is conditioned on use of a companion diagnostic. In short, the PMA is a request for approval to market the companion diagnostic in the U.S., together with and required for prescription of the drug, for one or more specified indications and must contain clinical evidence of safety and efficacy and sufficient validation of the companion diagnostic used to select patients for treatment with the drug.



The NDA application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the U.S. Similarly, FDA approval of a PMA must be obtained before a DRP® companion diagnostic may be legally marketed in the U.S.



Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.



The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must decide on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Similarly, the FDA must decide on accepting a PMA for review within 45 days of receipt. After acceptance, the FDA will begin substantive review of the PMA. During the review process, FDA will notify the PMA applicant via major/minor deficiency letters of any information needed by FDA to complete the review of the application. FDA may refer the PMA to an outside panel of experts (advisory committee). In general, all PMAs for the first-of-a-kind device are taken before the appropriate advisory panel for review and recommendation.





87







Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.



Similarly, an IDE application is considered approved 30 days after it has been received by the FDA, unless the FDA otherwise informs the sponsor via email prior to 30 calendar days from the date of receipt, that the IDE is approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. In cases of disapproval, a sponsor can respond to the deficiencies



Orphan Drugs



Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.



Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.



If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a therapeutic candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication. If one of our therapeutic candidates designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (EU) has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.



Expedited Development and Review Programs



The FDA has a fast-track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast-track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.





88







Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast-track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.



A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-market trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.



Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast-track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.



Post-Approval Requirements



Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse events and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label promotion,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.



The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.





89







The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:




● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention; 
--+----------------------------------


● | refusal to permit the import or export of products; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------




The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Marketing and promotion of approved drugs in other major oncology markets, such as the EU, are subject to similar requirements and regulations.



Other U.S. Regulatory Matters



Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to various healthcare laws, regulation, and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Our conduct, including those of our employees, as well as our business operations and relationships with third parties, including current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the PPACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage, and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements.



The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.



Marketing, promotion, and sale of approved drugs in other major oncology markets, such as the EU, are subject to similar requirements and regulations. For example, in the EU, safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and laws, which are widely considered to be the most stringent in the world.

U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity



Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of any future therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if issued, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for the lost opportunity to market the drug during the patent term while the drug was under the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from regulatory approval. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.



Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.



European Union Drug Development



Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.



The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.



European Union Drug Review and Approval



In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which comprises the 28 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of MAs.

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






92








● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (“SOPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SOPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Like the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (“SPCs”) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of the ability to market a drug during the patent term due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.



Coverage and Reimbursement



Sales of our therapeutic products and DRP® companion diagnostics, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.



Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical therapeutic candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific therapeutic candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Additionally, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.





93







The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.



In addition, where a drug product requires a companion diagnostic (in our case, a DRP® companion diagnostic), then companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. In general, insurance payors will cover and reimburse a companion diagnostic where sufficient clinical proof is provided to support that use of the companion diagnostic improves healthcare outcomes and/or reduces healthcare expenses associated with a given drug.



In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.



Healthcare Reform



The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.

There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the previous administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, there have been several executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have passed. In 2017, the Tax Act repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA’s mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a federal circuit decision that previously upheld Congress’ denial of $12.0 billion in “risk corridor” funding. In December 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, in December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Fifth Circuit holding that the state plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the individual mandate under Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. It is unclear how future litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA and our business. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the PPACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business. Complying with any new legislation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.



Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. The CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020, and designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, to offset the added expense of the 2020 suspension. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.



Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the way drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, the administration’s budget proposals for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on July 24, 2020, the administration announced four executive orders to lower drug prices, including allowing importation of certain drugs, changing how drug rebates are negotiated by middlemen, like pharmacy benefit managers, and directing such rebates to be passed to patients as point-of-sale discounts, and requiring Medicare to pay certain Part B drugs at the lowest price available in economically comparable countries (the details of which were released on September 13, 2020 and also expanded the policy to cover certain Part D drugs). The president has delayed the effective date of the international drug pricing order, pending discussion with major drug companies. How these executive orders will be implemented and their impact on the industry remain uncertain. Additionally, the FDA recently released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact our business. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the U.S. directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenue or increase our costs could also have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
