Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
Yelp's mission is to connect consumers with great local businesses. Since our founding in 2004, we have built a trusted local platform that delivers significant value to both consumers and businesses by helping each discover and interact with the other: our unrivaled content and transaction capabilities help consumers save time and money, while our advertising and other products help business owners gain visibility and engage with our large audience of purchase-oriented consumers. Yelp's core features and functionalities include:

• | Content. Yelp brings “word of mouth” online through consumer ratings, reviews, photos and more that share everyday business experiences. As of December 31, 2018, consumers had contributed approximately 177.4 million cumulative reviews of almost every type of local business. These contributions drive a powerful network effect whereby the expanded content draws in more consumers (and more prospective contributors), which improves the value proposition of our products to local businesses.


• | Discovery. Each day, millions of consumers search for great local businesses using Yelp's website and mobile app, as well as third-party partner services like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa personal assistant programs. Business owners, in turn, use our free and paid products to showcase and differentiate their businesses to these intent-driven consumers. For example, business representatives are able to provide information about their businesses and respond to reviews, among other things, by registering for a free account and “claiming” the business listing page for each of their locations. By December 31, 2018, business representatives had cumulatively claimed approximately 5.0 million business listing pages on Yelp. Businesses that want to further promote themselves can also pay for premium services such as targeted search advertising and additional enhancements to their business listing pages.


• | Engagement. Yelp provides multiple channels for consumers and businesses to engage directly with each other. In addition to writing and responding to reviews, consumers and businesses can interact through messaging features like Request-A-Quote and reservation booking tools. In the fourth quarter of 2018 alone, consumers submitted quote requests for 1.6 million projects through Request-A-Quote, which generated 4.4 million leads for service providers. We also facilitate consumer engagement with businesses in our restaurants and nightlife categories through Yelp Reservations, our online reservations product, and Yelp Waitlist (previously referred to as Yelp Nowait), which allows consumers to check wait times at restaurants and join waitlists remotely. Businesses used these products to manage over 22 million diners in December 2018, more than 1.7 million of whom made their reservation or joined the waitlist directly via Yelp.


• | Transactions. Our convenient transaction capabilities allow consumers to transact with local businesses without leaving Yelp, primarily through integrations with partners in key verticals. Online food ordering constitutes our largest category of transactions by revenue and volume and is currently available through our long-term partnership with Grubhub, which we entered into concurrently with our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub in 2017, among other partners. Our integration of Grubhub's restaurant network had more than doubled the number of order-enabled restaurants on Yelp by the end of 2018 compared to before the integration, while generating more profit per order than we generated prior to our sale of Eat24. Consumers can also book auto repairs (RepairPal), make spa and salon appointments (Vagaro), schedule legal consultations (LegalZoom) and order flowers (BloomNation) through Yelp, among many other transaction opportunities.


• | Attribution and Analytics. We offer businesses a range of tools and features that measure the effectiveness of our products and provide business insights. In addition to the reporting and advertising-management features available through our Yelp for Business Owners app, we enhanced our store-level attribution capabilities in 2018 through the launch of our Yelp Store Visits product and integrations with third-party data partners. The detailed reporting and analytics we have been able to offer as a result helped us sell our advertising products more successfully to national advertisers, growing revenue from these customers by 16% in 2018 compared to 2017. We also provide businesses with local analytics and insights based on our historical data and other proprietary content through our Yelp Knowledge program. 

We generate revenue primarily from the sale of advertising on our website and mobile app to businesses and, to a lesser extent, from fees on transactions completed on our platform and subscription fees for our non-advertising products. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated net revenue of $942.8 million, representing 11% growth over 2017, net income of $55.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $183.1 million. For information on how we define and calculate adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss), see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this Annual Report.

Our Strategy
Our strategy looks to leverage our competitive advantages — our brand, our large audience of intent-driven consumers, our content and the network dynamics on our platform — to increase the value we provide to consumers and businesses, while continuing to drive efficiency in our business model. In 2018, we embarked on a significant business transformation by transitioning from selling our advertising products pursuant to fixed-term contracts to selling under non-term contracts. We expect that 2019 will be another transition year for Yelp as we continue the repositioning of our business and strategy. We believe that we will drive long-term revenue growth and improved profitability by pursuing the following strategies in 2019:
Revenue Growth

• | Winning in Key Verticals. We are working to address our customers' operational needs with innovative solutions that build on our strengths in key verticals. In restaurants, our most trafficked category, we are developing a comprehensive consumer experience with the goal of establishing Yelp as the go-to app for diners and a best-in-class partner to restaurants, which we believe will have the added benefit of supporting strong consumer usage and engagement across other categories. On the consumer side, we are enhancing our recommendation capabilities by incorporating consumer insights, such as the dietary preferences mobile users have shared with us. For business owners, we are developing restaurant-specific solutions that address business owners’ unique operational needs, such as extending the functionality of Yelp Waitlist into an in-store kiosk, which has the potential to reduce labor costs and improve operational efficiency for businesses.

In home & local services, our largest and fastest growing category by revenue, we have driven consumer adoption with innovative product experiences, like Request-A-Quote, and plan to continue leveraging products with the goal of accelerating our monetization of this category. To increase consumer project submissions, we are working to make the quote submission process easier and employing product marketing. We are also improving our matching capabilities, offering new ways for service providers to drive leads to their businesses and testing the phone call attribution flow we successfully implemented in the restaurants vertical.

• | Expanding Our Product Offerings. We are developing new advertising products to help our customers differentiate their businesses. We are also introducing more fixed-price offerings at different price points to bridge the gap between our free offerings and our targeted search advertising product. For example, we have seen strong adoption of our Yelp Verified License product, which we launched in November 2018 at a monthly price point of $30. In addition to driving incremental revenue, this lower-priced product has exhibited strong retention rates and improved overall retention for the performance-based cost-per-click, or CPC, advertisers that have adopted it. We believe that providing more products like this across a range of price points will give new customers and trial users even more ways to grow with Yelp.


• | Providing More Value to Business Customers. We aim to provide advertisers with more value for their money, with the goal of driving monetization by increasing trial conversion, customer satisfaction and, ultimately, retention. We believe our efforts to optimize CPC prices and evolve our product experience to provide greater value to businesses have the potential to substantially increase revenue through retention. These efforts include our plan to significantly increase the leads delivered to our paying customers, with the aim of doubling the number of leads going to our paid advertisers in the home & local services category by the end of 2019. We are also working to deliver the best lead opportunities to highly responsive and highly rated advertisers, which would provide a clear benefit to both consumers and our customers. Other initiatives include providing our advertisers with more ways to promote their businesses, further developing our analytics tools to show advertisers how their ads are performing relative to competitors and how to optimize their spend, as well as providing advertisers more control over their ad campaigns. For example, advertisers will soon be able to choose campaign goals, whether that is driving more inbound phone calls or generating more clicks on their Yelp ads.


• | Capturing the National Opportunity. We plan to drive continued momentum in our national advertising business by expanding upon our successful go-to-market strategy and offering more solutions to meet the needs of large advertisers. We plan to grow our national and multi-location sales force in 2019 and focus their attention specifically on the top 250 restaurant and retail advertisers. We also plan to build on our implementation of a more consultative approach to sales and client care in 2018 by integrating product and product marketing with sales efforts, as well as by expanding client service and coverage. On the product side, we are extending our attribution offerings, creating engaging new ad units to drive consumer purchases, and providing tools for national advertisers and channel partners to track and manage their campaigns. We believe these initiatives will position us to capture a larger share of the national and multi-location opportunity.


• | Enhancing the Consumer Experience. Consumers drive the network dynamics on which our value proposition is based: growing consumer traffic and content contribution further benefits consumers and underpins our ability to create value for businesses through our products and services. To maintain strong growth in our app usage and deepen user engagement,

we remain focused on delivering unique product experiences that delight consumers. One of the ways we are doing that is by creating an even more personalized Yelp experience for our users. We are also creating new features that draw on Yelp’s unique content and comprehensive local data, as well as partnerships, to deliver only-on-Yelp product experiences. We believe experiences like booking sought-after seats at Yelp-exclusive restaurants, skipping the line at popular eateries and saving time and money on projects arranged via Request-A-Quote will help maintain strong growth in app usage and deepen consumer engagement, thereby increasing our value proposition to businesses.
Improved Profitability

• | Focusing on Our Most Efficient Sales Channels. In 2019, we plan to continue our efforts to build a more diversified, modern and efficient go-to-market strategy by shifting our emphasis to the most efficient and high-margin sales channels, including sales partnerships and our self-serve channel. In 2018, we launched the Yelp Ads Certified Partners Program to make it more efficient for partner agencies to manage ad campaigns on behalf of their small and medium-sized business clients by allowing them to independently sell and manage ad campaigns rather than working through Yelp to do so. This product-driven customer acquisition strategy complements our sales force and, going forward, we plan to continue to adapt this product to the structure of our agency partners to help design and execute ad campaigns that benefit their clients. We also plan to continue refining our self-serve channel, which allows businesses to purchase ads directly through our website, by offering additional products and customization options. This channel not only provides convenience and flexibility to our customers, but also generates high-margin revenue without heavy involvement from our sales force.


• | Reducing Local Sales Hiring. In keeping with shifting our focus to more efficient sales channels, we plan to hold our local sales headcount approximately steady in 2019 and, in doing so, focus on retaining more of our tenured sales representatives. Because more tenured sales representatives are generally more successful than less tenured representatives, we believe this will also improve overall sales performance.


• | Optimizing Consumer Marketing Spend. While organic growth driven by our community development efforts, as described below, continues to be the primary driver of our traffic, we will also continue investing in marketing in 2019 to leverage our brand and help fuel the network dynamics on our platform. However, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on our product and marketing investments in prior years by increasing our use of in-app and cross-product marketing. Although we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase overall in 2019 compared to 2018, we expect this initiative to save up to $15 million in marketing expenses.


• | Controlling Other Expenses. In addition to the initiatives described above, our ability to improve our margins will depend on our ability to effectively control and, where possible, reduce our expenses. For example, as we work to maintain a steady local sales headcount in 2019, we plan to fill vacancies on our San Francisco sales team that come about through attrition with replacements in lower-cost markets, which we believe will save approximately $10 million annually once the process is complete (though we expect sales and marketing expense to increase overall in 2019). We plan to continue evaluating opportunities to control or reduce other corporate expenses throughout 2019. 

In addition to the ways we plan to grow our business organically, we will also look to accelerate these strategies through effective partnerships that create great consumer experiences while generating attractive economics for our business. Building on the experience we have gained through our long-term Grubhub relationship, which continues to deliver significant value and growth, we entered into new partnerships in recent months with industry leaders including Visa, GoDaddy and Google, among others. We believe there is significant value to expanding through partnerships and will continue to explore additional opportunities in this area in 2019 and beyond.
Our Products and Services
Advertising
We provide a range of free and paid advertising products to businesses of all sizes, including the ability to deliver targeted search advertising to large local audiences through our website and mobile app. As in past years, advertising accounted for the vast majority of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018, accounting for 97% of our revenue, as compared to approximately 91% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and approximately 90% for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recognize revenue from our business listing and advertising products, including advertising sold by partners, as advertising revenue.

Free Online Business Account | We enable businesses to create a free online business account and claim the listing page for each of their business locations. With their free business accounts, businesses can view trends (e.g. statistics and charts of the performance of their pages on our platform), use the Revenue Estimator tool to quantify the revenue opportunity Yelp provides, message customers (e.g. by replying to messages or reviews either publicly or directly), update listing information (e.g. address, hours of operation) and offer Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates, as described below. 
Branded Profile | Our Branded Profile product provides businesses with access to premium features in connection with their business listing pages, such as the ability to update listing information and select photos or videos to highlight on the page through a slideshow feature. Businesses can also promote a desired transaction of their choosing — such as scheduling an appointment or printing a coupon — directly on their business listing pages with our Call to Action feature. This feature transfers consumers from a business’s listing page to the business’s own website to complete the action. Account support is available via phone and email for businesses that purchase a Branded Profile program.
Enhanced Profile | In addition to providing businesses with the same premium features and support options as our Branded Profile product, our Enhanced Profile product restricts how ads from other businesses appear on the business listing pages of our Enhanced Profile customers. 
Yelp Verified License | Yelp Verified License is a badge that appears on business listing pages as a paid upgrade for certain licensed advertisers, primarily in our home & local services category. The badge indicates that we have verified the business's trade license and confirmed it was in good standing as of a certain date, allowing businesses to distinguish themselves as licensed and helping consumers make safe and confident decisions when selecting businesses for their projects. 
Search and Other Ads | We allow businesses to promote themselves as a sponsored search result on our platform, on the listing pages of related businesses and as suggested “additional businesses” for consumers using our Request-A-Quote feature. We now sell ads primarily on a CPC basis, though we also offer impression-based ads. 
Ad Resales | We also generate revenue through the resale of our advertising products by certain agencies and partners, such as DexYP, as well as monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. In 2018, we launched the Yelp Ads Certified Partners Program, which allows partner agencies to independently sell and manage ad campaigns on behalf of their small and medium-sized business clients, providing increased centralization and flexibility. 

Transactions
In addition to our advertising products, we also offer several features and consumer-interactive tools to facilitate transactions between consumers and the local businesses they find on Yelp. We recognize revenue from these sources on a net basis as transactions revenue.

Yelp Platform | The Yelp Platform allows consumers to transact with businesses directly on our website or mobile app through partner integrations. Consumers can order flowers, purchase event tickets, and book spa and salon appointments, among many other transaction opportunities, all without leaving Yelp. 
Eat24 and the Grubhub Partnership | Prior to our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017, we generated revenue from our Yelp Eat24 business through arrangements with restaurants in which restaurants paid a commission percentage fee on orders placed through Yelp Eat24. Following the sale, Eat24’s restaurant network remains integrated on our platform and, pursuant to our strategic partnership, Grubhub’s restaurant network was integrated onto our platform mid-2018. We expect this partnership to provide consumers with a wider selection of restaurants and better delivery options, while improving our per-order profitability.
Yelp Deals | Our Yelp Deals product allows local business owners to create promotional discounted deals for their products and services, which are marketed to consumers through our platform. We typically earn a fee based on the discounted price of each deal sold. We process all customer payments and remit to the business the revenue share of any Yelp Deal purchased. 
Gift Certificates | Our Gift Certificates product allows local business owners to sell full-price gift certificates directly to consumers through their business listing pages. The business chooses the price point to offer (from $10 to $500), and consumers may purchase Gift Certificates denominated in such amounts. We earn a fee based on the amount of the Gift Certificate sold. We process all consumer payments and remit to the business the revenue share of any Gift Certificate purchased. 

Other Services
We generate other revenue through subscription services, licensing payments for access to Yelp data and other non-advertising, non-transaction arrangements, such as certain partnerships. We recognize revenue from these sources as other services revenue.

Yelp Reservations | We provide restaurants, nightlife and certain other venues with the ability to offer online reservations directly from their Yelp business listing pages through our Yelp Reservations product, which also includes front-of-house management tools. We offer this product as a monthly subscription service. 
Yelp Waitlist | Yelp Waitlist is a subscription-based waitlist management solution that allows consumers to check wait times and join waitlists remotely and businesses to efficiently manage seating and server rotation. Yelp Waitlist is available directly on business listing pages as well as in-store kiosks. 
Yelp WiFi Marketing | Our Yelp WiFi Marketing product provides businesses with the ability to create easy on-premises wifi access for customers, advertise products on the wifi log-in page, and collect contact and social media information from customers who access wifi for use in marketing campaigns. We offer this product as a monthly subscription service.
Yelp Knowledge | Through partnerships with companies such as Sprinklr, InMoment and Chatmeter, our Yelp Knowledge program offers business owners local analytics and insights through access to our historical data and other proprietary content. Our Yelp Knowledge partners pay us program fees for access to Yelp Knowledge content. 
Other Partnerships | Other non-advertising partner arrangements include content licensing and allowing third-party data providers to update and manage business listing information on behalf of businesses. 

Revenue by Product

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Net revenue by product: | | | | | 
Advertising | $ | 907,487 | | | $ | 775,678 | | $ | 648,235
Transactions | 13,694 | | | 60,251 | | | 62,495

Total net revenue | $ | 942,773 | | | $ | 850,847 | | $ | 716,063

Sales
We sell our products directly through our sales force, indirectly through partners and online through our website. Our sales force consisted of 4,029 employees as of December 31, 2018 and is located across our offices in San Francisco, California; Scottsdale, Arizona; New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario. From 2012 to 2016, we also had sales operations in Europe, including in Dublin, Ireland and Hamburg, Germany. In the fourth quarter of 2016, however, we wound down our sales activities in markets outside the United States and Canada, where we believe the long-term return on continued investment to be lower than opportunities for Yelp within our core markets.
Direct Sales. A large majority of our sales force — 3,850 employees as of December 31, 2018 — is dedicated to selling our advertising products, with a significantly smaller component responsible for selling our subscription products. Our sales force primarily sells CPC advertising; only a small percentage of ads continue to be impression-based. Sales representatives are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads by identifying and contacting businesses through direct engagement, direct marketing campaigns and weekly e-mails to claimed local businesses. Our direct sales force is focused on increasing revenue by adding new customers, and sales representatives are typically compensated on the basis of advertising sold in a given period. 
Sales Partnerships. Since 2014, we have allowed partners, such as DexYP, to sell certain of our advertising products as part of a package with their own advertising products to their advertiser bases. The products covered by these arrangements include our Enhanced Profile and CPC advertising. In 2018, we launched the Yelp Ads Certified Partner Program with the aim of making it more efficient for agencies to manage ad campaigns on behalf of their small and medium-sized business clients. By allowing partner agencies to independently sell and manage ad campaigns rather than working through Yelp to do so, this program has improved the process and increased flexibility. We continue to explore additional partnerships for the sale or bundling of our products, as well as with select marketing agencies. 
Self-Serve Ads. Our online, or self-serve, sales channel allows businesses to purchase advertising solutions directly from our website. Businesses can purchase sponsored CPC search advertising directly through this channel. The convenience of our self-serve sales channel helped us attract thousands of new advertisers in 2018, and we are continuing to test approaches to this sales channel, including by offering advertisers more options to customize their ads.
Customer Success. While the focus of our sales force has historically been on adding new customers, we also see opportunity to deepen our relationships with existing customers. To this end, our customer success team supports existing business advertisers through account management, cross-selling and retention initiatives. In 2018, we continued to grow our customer success team and focused on streamlining our customer success processes, which we believe will give us a greater ability to respond to changes in revenue retention that may emerge from the increasing portion of our customers who are able to cancel their advertising commitments at any time.
Consumer Engagement
At the heart of our business are the vibrant communities of contributors that contribute the content on our platform. These contributors provide rich, firsthand information about local businesses in the form of reviews, ratings, tips, photos and videos. Each review, rating, tip, photo and video expands the breadth and depth of the content on our platform, which drives a powerful network effect: the expanded content draws in more consumers and more prospective contributors. Although measures of our content (including our cumulative review metric) and traffic (including our desktop and mobile unique visitors and app unique device metrics) do not factor directly into the advertising arrangements we have with our advertising customers, this network effect underpins our ability to deliver clicks and ad impressions to advertisers. Increases in these metrics improve our value proposition to local businesses as they seek easy-to-use and effective advertising solutions.
Community Management
6

For the above reasons, we foster and support communities of contributors and make the consumer experience our highest priority. We have a team of Community Managers and Community Ambassadors based across the United States and Canada whose primary goals are to support and grow their local communities of contributors, raise brand awareness and engage with their surrounding communities through:

• | planning and executing fun and engaging events for the community, such as parties, outings and activities at restaurants, museums, hotels and other local places of interest;


• | getting to know community members and helping them get to know one another to foster an offline community experience that can be transferred online;


• | promoting Yelp, including guest appearances on local television and radio, and at local events such as concerts and street fairs; and


• | writing weekly e-mail newsletters to share information with the community about local businesses, events and activities.

Through these activities, we believe our community management team helps us increase awareness of our platform and grow avid communities who are willing to contribute content to our platform. These active contributors may be invited to attend sponsored social events, but do not receive compensation for their contributions. This community growth drives the network effect whereby contributed reviews expand the breadth and depth of our content base. This expansion draws an increasing number of consumers to access the content on our platform, thus inspiring new and existing contributors to create additional reviews that can be shared with this growing audience.
In general, the communities we entered into earlier are more populous than those we entered into later, and we have already entered many of the largest cities in the United States and Canada. For these and other reasons, launching additional communities may not yield results similar to those of our existing communities. As a result, we continue to believe that development of our existing communities currently provides the greatest opportunity for growth, and plan to continue to focus our community development efforts on existing communities in 2019.
Reviews
As of December 31, 2018, our communities had contributed approximately 177.4 million cumulative reviews of almost every type of local business. Of the approximately 177.4 million cumulative reviews our contributors had submitted through December 31, 2018, approximately 124.8 million were recommended and available on business listing pages; approximately 39.5 million were not recommended and available on secondary pages; and approximately 13.1 million had been removed from our platform. Although they do not factor into a business’s overall star rating, we provide access to reviews that are not recommended because they provide additional perspectives and information on reviewed businesses, as well as transparency of the efficacy of our automated recommendation software. 
The reviews contributed to our platform cover a wide set of local business categories, including restaurants, shopping, beauty and fitness, arts, entertainment and events, home and local services, health, nightlife, travel and hotel, auto and other categories. In the charts below, we highlight the breakdown by category of local businesses that have received reviews on our platform and the breakdown by category of the cumulative reviews contributed to our platform through December 31, 2018.

(1) | The above chart provides a breakdown of the categories of businesses that had received reviews that were available on our platform — i.e., including reviews that were recommended or not recommended, but not including reviews that had been removed from our platform — as of December 31, 2018, including some businesses that had received only reviews that were not recommended. The categories reflect Yelp's category definitions as of December 31, 2018.

(2) | The above chart provides a breakdown of our cumulative reviews as of December 31, 2018, including reviews that had been removed from our platform. The categories of the businesses associated with these reviews reflect Yelp's category definitions as of December 31, 2018.

We believe that the concentration of reviews in the restaurant and shopping categories in particular is primarily due to the frequency with which individuals visit specific businesses or engage in certain activities versus others. For example, an individual may eat at a restaurant three times in one week or go shopping once a week, but the same individual is unlikely to visit a mechanic, get a haircut or use a home or local service with the same frequency. The top five industry categories accounted for an aggregate of 78% of our advertising revenue (excluding advertising sold by partners) for the year ended December 31, 2018, broken down as follows: Home & Local Services, 33%; Restaurants, 14%; Beauty & Fitness, 12%; Health, 11%; and Shopping, 8%.
Technology
Product development and innovation are core pillars of our strategy. We devote a substantial portion of our resources to researching and developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions, conducting product testing and quality assurance testing, improving core technology and strengthening our technological expertise. In addition, we acquired talent and technology through our acquisitions of Nowait and Turnstyle in 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, product development expenses totaled $212.3 million, $175.8 million and $138.5 million, respectively. 
We aim to delight our users and business partners with our products. We provide our web-based and mobile services using a combination of in-house and third-party technology solutions and products:

• | Search and Ranking Technology. We leverage the data stored on our platform and our proprietary indexing and ranking techniques to provide our users with contextual, relevant and up-to-date results to their search queries. For example, a consumer desiring environmentally-friendly carpet cleaners does not have to call individual cleaners to inquire about their use of chemical-based cleaning solutions. Instead, the consumer can search for “environmentally-friendly carpet cleaners” on Yelp and discover cleaners with the best service and “green” cleaning products that serve a specific neighborhood.


• | Recommendation Software. We employ our proprietary automated recommendation software to analyze and screen all reviews submitted to our platform. We believe our recommendation technology is one of the key contributors to the quality and integrity of the reviews on our platform and the success of our service. See “—Consumer Protection Efforts” below for additional details regarding our recommendation software.


• | Mobile Solutions. We have seen substantial growth in consumers accessing information about local businesses through mobile devices, and anticipate that growth in use of our mobile platform will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future. Our most engaged users are on our mobile app, making it particularly critical to our continued success. For example, in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, mobile devices accounted for approximately 80% of all searches and approximately 76% of all ad clicks on our platform, compared to 79% and approximately 70%, respectively, in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

To take advantage of this trend, we have invested significant resources into the development of our comprehensive mobile platform for consumers supporting the major smartphone operating systems available today, iOS and Android. Over time, we have enhanced the functionality of our mobile platform, such that it provides similar and, in some areas, greater functionality than our website. Some of the innovations we introduced through our mobile platform include “check-ins,” “tips,” “comments,” “Nearby” and “Monocle,” our augmented reality feature. We also offer a mobile app for business owners, designed to make it easier for them to engage with their customers and manage their Yelp profiles. The Yelp for Business Owners app is currently available for iOS and Android. 

• | Advertising Technologies. We use proprietary ad targeting and delivery technologies designed to provide relevant local advertisements to consumers viewing our content. Our proprietary ad delivery system leverages our unique repository of data to provide useful ads to users and high value leads to advertisers.


• | Infrastructure. Our web and mobile platforms are currently hosted from multiple locations, primarily through Amazon Web Services. We also host parts of our infrastructure within shared data environments in California and Virginia, as well as with third-party leased server providers. Our web and mobile platforms are designed to have high availability, from the Internet connectivity providers we choose, to the servers, databases and networking hardware that we deploy. We design our systems such that the failure of any individual component is not expected to affect the overall availability of our platform. We also leverage other third-party Internet-based (cloud) services such as rich-content storage, map-related services, ad serving and bulk processing.

9


• | Network Security. Computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service and other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of computer systems have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and we expect them to occur periodically on our systems in the future. For this reason, our platform includes a host of encryption, antivirus, firewall and patch-management technologies designed to help protect and maintain the systems located at data centers as well as other systems and computers across our business.

Consumer Protection Efforts
Our success depends on our ability to maintain consumer trust in our solutions and in the quality and integrity of the user content and other information found on our platform. We dedicate significant resources to the goal of maintaining and enhancing the quality, authenticity and integrity of the reviews on our platform, primarily through the following methods:
Automated Recommendation Software. We use proprietary software to analyze the relevance, reliability and utility of each review submitted to our platform. The software applies the same objective standards to each review based on a wide range of data associated with the review and reviewer, regardless of whether the business being reviewed advertises on Yelp. These objective standards include various measures of relevance, reliability and utility, such as the reviewer’s type and level of activity with Yelp (which might correspond to the reviewer’s reliability or suggest reviewer biases) and whether certain reviews originate from related Internet Protocol addresses (which might mean the reviews were submitted by the same person). The results of this analysis can change over time as the software factors in new information, which may result in reviews that were previously recommended becoming not recommended, and reviews that were previously not recommended being restored to recommended status. Reviews that the software deems to be the most useful and reliable are published directly on business listing pages, though neither we nor the software purport to establish whether or not any individual review is authentic. As of December 31, 2018, our software recommended approximately 71% of the reviews submitted to our platform. Reviews that are not recommended are published on secondary pages and do not factor into a business’s overall star rating. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 22% of the reviews submitted to our platform were not recommended but still accessible on our platform.
Education. We provide businesses with information and materials regarding our stance against review solicitation and work with businesses to ensure that any they are aware that Yelp does not work with third-party review solicitation companies that offer to artificially inflate search rankings and online reputations. By working to educate businesses about why review solicitation harms consumers and can undermine a business’ reputation, we believe we can reduce the frequency with businesses engage in such activities. 
Sting Operations. We routinely conduct sting operations to identify businesses and individuals who offer or receive cash, discounts or other benefits in exchange for reviews. For example, we may respond to advertisements offering to pay for reviews that are posted on Craigslist, Facebook and other platforms. We also receive and investigate tips from our users about potential paid reviews. If we identify or confirm any such issues through our investigations, we typically pursue one or more of the courses of action described below (each of which we may also employ on a stand-alone basis).
Consumer Alerts Program. We issue consumer alert warnings on business listing pages from time to time when we encounter suspicious activity that we believe is indicative of attempts to deceive or mislead consumers. For example, we may issue a consumer alert if we encounter a business attempting to purchase favorable reviews, or if a large number of favorable reviews are submitted from the same Internet Protocol address. Consumer alerts generally remain in effect for 90 days, or longer if the deceptive practices continue.
Coordination with Law Enforcement. We regularly cooperate with law enforcement and consumer protection agencies to investigate and identify businesses and individuals who may be engaged in false advertising or deceptive business practices relating to reviews. For example, in 2013, we assisted the New York Attorney General with “Operation Clean Turf,” an undercover investigation targeting review manipulation that resulted in 19 companies agreeing to pay more than $350,000 in fines to the State of New York. In 2016, in a continuation of this investigation, the New York Attorney General announced settlements with six additional businesses that tried to mislead consumers, resulting in the businesses agreeing to pay fines and to take measures to increase the honesty and transparency of their online reviews. 
Legal Action. Our terms of service prohibit the buying and selling of reviews, as well as writing fake reviews. In egregious cases, we take legal action against businesses we believe to be engaged in deceptive practices based on these prohibitions.
Removal of Reviews. We regularly remove reviews from our platform that we believe violate our terms of service, including, without limitation: fake or defamatory reviews; content that has been bought, sold or traded; threatening, harassing or lewd content, as well as hate speech and other displays of bigotry; and content that violates the rights of any third party or any applicable law. Consumers can access information about reviews that we have removed for a particular business by clicking on a link on the 
10

business’s listing page. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 7% of the reviews submitted to our platform had been removed.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, as well as confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of patent, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations internationally. Our registration efforts have focused on gaining protection of our trademarks for Yelp and the Yelp burst logo, among others. These marks are material to our business and essential to our brand identity as they enable others to easily identify us as the source of the services offered under these marks. We currently have limited patent protection for our core business, which may make it more difficult to assert certain of our intellectual property rights. For example, the contractual restrictions and trade secrets that protect our proprietary technology and algorithms provide only a limited safeguard against infringement.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is also costly and time consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 
Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights, and frequently request license agreements or threaten to enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of such rights. From time to time, we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights. We are also currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
Competition
We compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and we expect competition to intensify further in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants. Our competitors consist of companies that help businesses — particularly businesses in our strategically important restaurants and home & local services categories — connect and engage with consumers, including:

• | online search engines and directories, such as Google, as well as traditional, offline business guides and directories;


• | online and offline providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals, such as TripAdvisor;


• | providers of online marketing and tools for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, as well as various forms of traditional offline advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages and newspapers;


• | restaurant reservation and seating tools, such as OpenTable, as well as food ordering and delivery services; and


• | home and/or local services-related platforms and offerings, such as ANGI Homeservices.

Our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater market share, established marketing relationships with, and access to, large existing user bases and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. These companies may use these advantages to offer products similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. Certain competitors could also use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in markets in which we operate.
We believe our ability to compete successfully for users, content, and advertising and other customers depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
11


• | the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;


• | our ability, in and of itself as well as in comparison to the ability of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services;


• | the quantity, quality and reliability of our content, including its breadth, depth and timeliness;


• | our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of our competitors;


• | the size, composition and level of engagement of our consumer audience relative to those of our competitors;


• | our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;


• | the pricing of our products and services relative to those of our competitors;


• | the actual or perceived return our customers receive from our products and services relative to returns from our competitors;


• | the frequency and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;


• | acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and


• | our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.

Government Regulation
As a company conducting business on the Internet, we are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws regarding privacy, data retention, distribution of user-generated content, consumer protection and data protection, among others. For example:

• | Privacy. Because we receive, store and process personal information and other user data, including credit card information in certain cases, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data.


• | Liability for Third-Party Action. We rely on laws limiting the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties.


• | Advertising. We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines that regulate the way we distinguish paid search results and other types of advertising from unpaid search results.


• | Information Security and Data Protection. The laws in many jurisdictions require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, many jurisdictions have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information.

Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. They may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, laws providing immunity to websites that publish user-generated content are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. 
Similarly, new legislation and regulations may significantly impact our business. There have been various Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change as a result. Regulatory frameworks for privacy issues in particular are also currently in flux worldwide, and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, may be subject to varying interpretations and evolving practices that would create uncertainty for us. Similarly, the recently passed California Consumer Privacy Act, which is expected to become effective in 2020, also creates new data privacy rights for users 
12

that may result in significantly greater compliance burdens for us.
Changes in existing laws or regulations or their interpretations, as well as new legislation or regulations, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, increase our operating costs and require significant management time and attention. Such changes could also make it more difficult for consumers to use our platform, resulting in less traffic and revenue, or make it more difficult for us to provide effective advertising tools to businesses on our platform, resulting in fewer advertisers and less revenue. As our business grows and evolves, we will also become subject to additional laws and regulations, including in jurisdictions outside of the United States. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States, as is the case with GDPR. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. 
Our Culture and Employees
We take great pride in our company culture and consider it to be one of our competitive strengths. Our culture is at the foundation of our success, and it continues to help drive our business forward as a pivotal part of our everyday operations. It allows us to attract and retain a talented group of employees, create an energetic work environment and continue to innovate in a highly competitive market. As of December 31, 2018, we had 6,030 employees globally.
Our culture extends beyond our offices and into the local communities in which people use Yelp. Our community management team’s responsibilities include supporting the sharing of experiences by consumers in the local markets that they serve and increasing brand awareness. We organize events several times a year to recognize our most important contributors, facilitating face-to-face interactions, building the Yelp brand and fostering the sense of true community in which we believe so strongly. We also engage with small businesses. For example, we established the Yelp Small Business Advisory Council as a way to interact with and get feedback from our core community of local business owners. We also work with the U.S. Small Business Administration and other partners to educate small business owners across the United States on best practices for online marketing.
In addition, The Yelp Foundation, a non-profit organization established by our board of directors in November 2011 (the "Foundation"), directly supports consumers and local businesses in the communities in which we operate. In 2011, our board of directors approved the contribution and issuance to the Foundation of 520,000 shares of our common stock, of which the Foundation had sold 217,500 shares as of December 31, 2018. The Foundation uses the proceeds from the sale of its shares of our common stock to make grants to local non-profit organizations that are actively engaged in supporting community and small business growth. As of December 31, 2018, the Foundation held 302,500 shares of common stock, representing less than 1% of our outstanding capital stock.
Seasonality
Our business is affected both by cyclicality in business activity and by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and advertising spending. We believe our rapid growth has masked most of the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our business matures, we expect that the cyclicality and seasonality in our business may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate. In particular, based on historical trends, we expect traffic numbers to be weakest in the fourth quarter of the year in connection with end of the year holidays.
