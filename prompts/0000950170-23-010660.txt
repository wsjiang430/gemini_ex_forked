Item 1 - Business
 Turtle Beach Corporation’s mission is to deliver the ultimate experience to gamers by providing high-quality, high-performance gaming accessories, including headsets, keyboards, mice, gamepad controllers, simulation hardware, microphones, and more. For nearly 50 years, Turtle Beach has been a pioneer and key innovator in audio technology, and today it is one of the most recognized brand names in gaming. Headquartered in White Plains, New York, Turtle Beach was incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010 and the Company’s stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol HEAR.
 The Turtle Beach® brand has been the market share leader in console gaming headsets for 13-years running with a vast portfolio of headsets for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles, as well as for personal computers (PCs) and mobile/tablet devices. Turtle Beach Corporation’s PC peripherals brand, ROCCAT®, creates PC gaming keyboards, mice and other gaming accessories focused on the PC gaming market. And in 2021, Turtle Beach expanded the brand beyond gaming headsets and began making game controllers and gaming flight simulation accessories. Turtle Beach also creates high-quality USB and analog microphones for gamers, streamers, professionals, and students that embrace cutting-edge technology and design.
 
Gaming Accessories Business
Turtle Beach launched its first gaming headset and the first ever console gaming headset – the X51 – in 2005 and has gone on to become the leading brand in gaming headsets, as well as a top five overall gaming accessory business in the world. The Company designs and markets a broad assortment of gaming headsets and audio accessories for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles, as well as for PC and mobile/tablet devices. The Company’s recent acquisitions expanded Turtle Beach Corporation’s reach into the global markets for PC-specific gaming headsets, keyboards, mice, digital/USB and analog/XLR microphones for streamers and content creators, and other gaming accessories, and in 2021, the Company further expanded the Turtle Beach brand with its first game controller and gaming simulation accessories. Turtle Beach products are distributed globally, sold at thousands of storefronts, including major retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, GAME, GameStop, EB Games, Media Markt, Saturn, Target, and Walmart.
 The Turtle Beach brand offers gamers a broad assortment of gaming accessory products available at multiple price tiers ranging from $20 to $300+, with most models compatible with multiple gaming platforms (i.e. – a headset is compatible with Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, mobile, etc.). We believe the price tiers correspond to customer profiles, beginning with entry-level gamers and progressing through casual, enthusiast, core, as well as with professional streamers, content creators, and esports gamers. Each successive price tier incorporates higher level features, comfort, and finish. For example, premium headsets typically includes features like larger 50mm speakers, metal headbands, memory foam, powerful amplified 3D surround sound, active noise-cancellation, and Bluetooth connectivity. Additional features include Mic Monitoring, gaming audio presets like Bass and/or Vocal Boost, Turtle Beach’s exclusive Superhuman Hearing® sound setting which delivers a competitive advantage, a removable or flip-to-mute microphone, Turtle Beach’s proprietary ProSpecs glasses-friendly technology, and long-lasting rechargeable batteries.
 Gaming consoles like the latest Xbox and PlayStation systems have evolved into full home entertainment hubs, and mobile tablet devices have become mainstream entertainment platforms with gaming on mobile/tablet devices now representing approximately 50% of the global

gaming market. Turtle Beach continues to evolve its product portfolio to reflect how content is consumed. While each Turtle Beach headset is designed for a primary platform, such as a specific console or PC, nearly all can be used with multiple platforms, and are compatible with mobile/tablet devices through a standard 3.5mm jack or Bluetooth connectivity. Additionally, Turtle Beach products are often displayed in multiple in-store sections by retailers. This includes platform-specific gaming aisles for Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, Virtual Reality (VR), and mobile/tablet products, as well as displayed on in-store kiosks that allow shoppers to experience each headset’s fit, feel, and audio quality, increasing the prominence of the Turtle Beach brand in physical retail locations, as well as online.
Industry Overview
 Turtle Beach operates in a $193 billion global games and accessories market. The global gaming audience now exceeds global cinema and music markets with over three billion active gamers worldwide. Gaming peripherals, such as headsets, keyboards, mice, microphones, controllers, and simulation controls are estimated to be an $8.4 billion business globally with about 80% of that market in the Americas and Europe where the Company’s business is focused.
Competitive esports is a global phenomenon where professional gamers train and compete to win prize money, partner with major brands, and attract dedicated fans – similar to traditional professional sports. In 2022, there were over 530 million esports viewers in 2022, approximately 50% of whom considered themselves “esports enthusiasts,” and that number is expected to increase to roughly 650 million viewers by 2025 according to an April 2022 report from Newzoo.
 The console and PC gaming accessory markets are also driven by major game launches and long-running franchises that encourage players to continually buy equipment and accessories. On Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and PC, flagship games like Call of Duty, Destiny, Star Wars: Battlefront, Battlefield, Grand Theft Auto, and battle royale games like Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Apex Legends, and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, are examples of major franchises that prominently feature online multiplayer modes that encourage communication and drive increased demand for gaming headsets. Many of these established franchises launch new titles annually, leading into the holidays and as a result can cause an additional boost to the normally strong holiday sales for gaming accessories.
 Many gamers play online where a gaming headset, which includes a microphone, is required because it allows players to communicate with each other in real-time, provides a more immersive experience, and delivers a competitive advantage.
 Console Headset Market
 In 2022, Turtle Beach was the leading console gaming headset manufacturer in the U.S. and other major console markets. Turtle Beach has achieved these global market shares by delivering high-quality products that often include first-to-market innovations, robust features, superior sound, unmatched comfort, and top customer support – all key factors that consumers seek when shopping for a gaming headset.
 The global market for console gaming headsets, in which Turtle Beach has been the market leader for the past 13 years, is estimated to be approximately $1.4 billion. PlayStation and Xbox consoles continue to be dominant gaming platforms in North America and Europe for games that drive headset usage. Consistent with a historical pattern of major new console launches every 7-8 years, Microsoft and Sony launched their latest consoles, Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, ahead of the 2020 holiday season, and in 2021/2022 demand for the latest Xbox and PlayStation consoles exceeded the available supply for consumers to purchase. In 2023, the demand for gaming consoles is expected to improve as additional supplies are available, which is expected to help the overall console market reach single digit percentage growth.
 Nintendo has sold over 122.5 million units of its highly popular Nintendo Switch since the platform's release in early 2017. Nintendo continues adding and expanding its library of games, including an increased number of multiplayer chat-enabled games. Nintendo also sells the Nintendo Switch Lite, a follow-on product that offers gamers the hand-held only version of their popular gaming console.
 PC Accessories Market
 The market for PC gaming headsets, mice, and keyboards is estimated to be approximately $3.2 billion. PC gaming continues to be a main gaming platform in the U.S. and internationally, similarly driven by popular AAA game launches, by popular PC-specific esports leagues, teams, and players, content creators, and influencers, and with the introduction of cross-platform play – where PC gamers can play online against other gamers playing the same game on an Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo Switch. While most games are available on multiple platforms, gaming on PC offers advantages including improved graphics, increased speed and precision of mouse/keyboard controls, and the ability for deeper customization. Gaming mice and keyboards are engineered to provide gamers with high-end performance and a superior gaming experience through features such as fast key and button response times, improved materials and build quality, comfortable ergonomic designs, programmable keys and buttons, and software suites to customize and control devices and settings.
 PC gaming mice come in a variety of different ergonomic shapes and sizes, are available in both wired and wireless models, offer different sensor options (optical or laser) and responsiveness, and often feature integrated RGB LED lighting and software to unify the lighting

with other devices for a visually consistent PC gaming appearance. Similarly, PC gaming keyboards often deliver a competitive advantage by offering options for ultra-responsive mechanical and optical key switches that feel and sound different, as well as offer customizable lighting.
 Our PC gaming headsets, keyboards, and mice span price tiers ranging from low-to-high for entry-level to professional gamers with each successive price tier adding features and build quality. We seek to infuse differentiation and innovation into our PC products, including our own design for keyboard and mouse switches, innovative RGB LED lighting, and extensive ergonomic design testing and modeling.
 Other Gaming Accessories Market
 The market for third-party game controllers is estimated to be approximately $0.5 billion, with the same retail footprint and consumer base that Turtle Beach gaming headsets compete in. Turtle Beach entered the controller market in 2021 with the Recon Controller, a wired controller for Xbox and PC that added Turtle Beach-exclusive audio features like Superhuman Hearing and extra buttons/functionality to a proven ergonomic controller design. In 2022, Turtle Beach expanded its controller portfolio with the launch of the REACT-R Controller which offers many of the same features as the Recon Controller, but for a lower price. Additionally, in 2022 Turtle Beach introduced two mobile-focused game controllers – the Recon Cloud Hybrid Controller, and the Atom Controller.
 PC and console flight simulation hardware adds another $0.5 billion to Turtle Beach’s total available market with opportunity for new products. In 2021, Turtle Beach launched the VelocityOne Flight Universal Control System for Xbox and PC, and in 2022 the Company expanded the VelocityOne line with the VelocityOne Rudder pedals and VelocityOne Stand, which perfectly pair with the VelocityOne Flight control system for the complete, most immersive flight simulation experience on the market. Turtle Beach also launched the VelocityOne Flightstick, which is a single stick joystick controller for air and space flight combat games. In 2023, Turtle Beach plans to further grow its gaming simulation portfolio with new VelocityOne products in flight simulation and other adjacent gaming simulation categories.
 Business Strategy
 We intend to further build upon Turtle Beach’s brand awareness, innovation, superior audio technology and high-quality products, as well as further promote and expand the brand in certain geographic regions to increase sales and profitability. The Company's strategy focuses on the following:
 •Continue to Advance Our Turtle Beach Brand. We believe that Turtle Beach’s reputation among gamers is a competitive advantage, and that our success is attributable to our emphasis on creating the highest quality, most innovative products and leveraging our extensive global distribution footprint to deliver these products to more gamers around the world.
 We continue to invest the resources necessary to maintain and expand our capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies, resulting in more products to serve more price tiers. We will continue to advance the best-selling Turtle Beach gaming audio business forward with new headsets like the Stealth 700 Gen 2 MAX and Stealth Pro and will continue our expansion into the game controllers and gaming simulation accessory markets with products like the Atom Controller and VelocityOne Flightstick.
 •Grow Revenue in New Markets. We intend to increase our available markets by continuing to develop internally, or through partnerships or acquisitions, products in new gaming accessory categories like game controllers and gaming simulation. As a result, for the first time, almost 25% of Turtle Beach revenues in 2022 were derived from categories outside console gaming headsets – the market Turtle Beach has led for the past 13 years.
 •Targeted Geographic Expansion. We will continue efforts for further growth, specifically in key Asian and other select markets as the Company looks to deliver Turtle Beach products to an even wider audience of global gamers in 2023 and beyond.
 •Sustainable Products. Our investment in sustainable products is an ongoing and continued focus for Turtle Beach Corporation. In 2022, Turtle Beach transitioned to using sustainably sourced paper packaging materials for the majority of gaming headsets and eliminated most plastics from packaging. In March 2023, we launched the Stealth 600 Gen 2 MAX Teal & Pink colorways as our first carbon neutral products, as well as partnered with Climate Impact Partners’ Million Mangroves program, where we contribute to helping develop new mangrove forests which help combat carbon.


To maintain and/or improve our competitive position in our markets we are focused on the following:
 •continuing to deliver innovative, high quality gaming headsets that provide superior game and chat audio, premium comfort, and advanced features designed to help gamers have a deeply immersive experience;
 •continuing to deliver innovations in speed, precision, RGB LED lighting and form factor in PC gaming keyboards, mice, and other gaming categories that can leverage those capabilities;
 •continuing to expand our product lines in game controllers and gaming simulation accessories, reaching into additional categories including mobile controllers and racing simulation products;
 •maintaining our position at key retailers with products available in multiple locations throughout retailers;
 •continuing investments in our ecommerce platforms to drive profitable growth by expanding customer reach, reducing cost-to-serve, and creating differentiated customer experiences;
 •maintaining our strategic relationships, and continuing investment in partnerships, which we believe provide the Turtle Beach brand a larger presence with consumers and create opportunities for retailers to carry our products; and
 •leveraging high-quality technical support and delivering customer service experience that exceed consumer expectations and develop brand loyalty.
 Intellectual Property
 We operate in an industry where innovation, investment in new ideas, and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are critical to success. With a nearly 50-year history as pioneers in PC and gaming audio, Turtle Beach has a substantial base of IP assets with over 400 patents on current and future product development.
 As a third-party gaming accessory company, certain technology used in gaming consoles requires a license to enable products to connect to that platform. While PlayStation does not require any license to produce headsets that can connect to their platforms, wireless connections on the Xbox platforms require the purchase of proprietary chips to integrate into the locked chat audio. The Company believes it currently has the necessary licenses, as well as the ability to obtain the necessary licenses, to produce compatible products.
 Supply Chain and Operations
 We have a global network of suppliers that manufacture products to meet the quality standards sought by our customers and our cost objectives. We have worked closely with component, manufacturing, and global logistic partners to build a supply chain that we consider dependable, scalable, and efficient to provide high-quality, reliable products employing leading cost management practices. The use of outsourced manufacturing facilities is designed to take advantage of specific expertise and allow for flexibility and scalability to respond to both seasonality and changing demands for our products.
 We have experienced and may continue to experience increased freight costs and component availability challenges. Further, market conditions have significantly increased the lead time on many product components, causing us to purchase components earlier than normal to meet forecasted demand, which, in some cases, led to excess inventories of certain components ordered with long lead times ahead of shifting demand. We expect to continue to experience challenges impacting our supply chain and logistics operations. As a result, we continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our manufacturing and freight providers to reduce costs.
 We believe we have strong, long-term relationships with our suppliers and that, subject to the discussion in Item 1A,“Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we expect to continue to be able to obtain a sufficient supply of quality products on satisfactory terms.
 Retail Distribution
 Our products are sold in over 40 countries by retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, GAME, GameStop, EB Games, Media Markt, Saturn, Target, and Walmart. We often have a broader assortment and more shelf space than competitors at video game and electronics retailers such as Best Buy and GameStop, which we believe reinforces the brand’s authenticity with gaming enthusiasts, and our presence in mass channel retailers such as Walmart and Target enable the brand to reach a wider audience of casual gamers. Our established presence on Amazon and other online retail sites, and positive consumer product ratings on those sites, increases the search visibility of our products and helps to influence both online and in-store sales.
 Turtle Beach Europe Limited (“TB Europe”), located in the U.K., serves as a primary sales office for the European market and has strengthened our international operations with support for sales, marketing, customer service and distribution.


Our websites, TurtleBeach.com and ROCCAT.com are important focal points for our product sales and marketing efforts, serving as destinations for consumers to learn about the brands and products, and as a place to maintain ongoing interactivity.

Customers
 Our business customer base is comprised primarily of large retailers and distributors, both domestic and international. In 2022, net sales to our major market channels consisted of $148.7 million to North American retail customers, $58.1 million to European customers, $7.3 million to North American distributors and $26.1 million to other customers.
Our five largest individual customers accounted for approximately 67% of our gross sales in 2022, 66% of our gross sales in 2021, and 67% of our gross sales in 2020. During 2022, our four largest customers - Walmart, Target, Amazon, Best Buy - each accounted for between 11% to 23% of our consolidated net sales.
Seasonality
 Our business is seasonal with a significant portion of sales and profits typically occurring around the holiday period. Historically, more than 45% of revenues are generated during the period from September through December as new products are introduced and consumers engage in holiday shopping. In addition, launches of major new online multiplayer games, and specific retailer purchasing behavior, can drive significant revenue shifts between months and quarters in a given year. In the past few years, normal seasonal patterns have been significantly changed due to pandemic-driven shifts in consumer demand.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, Turtle Beach had 269 employees, of which 245 were full-time salaried employees, with the remaining being contracted employees.
 Corporate Culture
 We are focused on creating a corporate culture of integrity and respect, with the goal of working together to drive our business to be creative, innovative, and competitive. To achieve these objectives, we have adopted and regularly communicate to our employees the following core values:

 We are further committed to developing our employees professionally by leveraging our Intellectual Capital (IC) process. The IC process includes constructive reviews and various talent and leadership development initiatives conducted by the management team and provided throughout an employee’s career.
We conduct anonymous employee culture surveys annually to monitor employee engagement and satisfaction, while identifying matters that need to be addressed and, in 2022, exceeded our employee satisfaction goal across the Company. While we take pride in our strong employee satisfaction, we are always seeking to ensure our employees feel valued and proud to be a part of the Turtle Beach team.
Diversity and Inclusion
We have always believed diversity in the workplace creates an environment where different perspectives lead to improved creativity, productivity, team member engagement, and overall employee happiness. To embrace diversity, we:
 •Implemented and tracked diversity metrics through our recruiting process; and
 •Included diversity statements in all job postings on our Turtle Beach Careers website and social media channels, such as LinkedIn.
 Compensation and Benefits


We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by employee level and by the country where the employees are located) include, among other items, bonuses, equity-based compensation awards, retirement plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, advocacy resources, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
