 Item 1.    Business
 Business 
 The Company
 Trinseo S.A. (NYSE: TSE) is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) formed in 2010 and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. Prior to our formation, our business was wholly owned by Dow. On June 17, 2010, investment funds advised or managed by affiliates of Bain Capital acquired our business and Dow Europe Holding B.V. During 2016, Bain Capital divested its entire ownership in the Company in a series of secondary offerings to the market. 
 We are a leading global materials company engaged in the manufacture and marketing of synthetic rubber, latex binders, and plastics, including various specialty and technologically differentiated products. We have leading market positions in many of the markets in which we compete. Our products are incorporated into a wide range of our customers’ products throughout the world, including tires and other products for automotive applications, carpet and artificial turf backing, coated paper, specialty paper and packaging board, food packaging, appliances, medical devices, consumer electronics and construction applications, among others. We have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of global customers, many of whom are leaders in their markets and rely on us for formulation, technological differentiation, and compounding expertise to find sustainable solutions for their businesses. Many of our products represent only a small portion of a finished product’s production costs, but provide critical functionality to the finished product and are often specifically developed to customer specifications. Therefore, we seek to regularly develop new and improved products and processes, supported by our intellectual property portfolio, designed to enhance our customers’ product offerings. We believe these product traits result in substantial customer loyalty. 
 We have significant manufacturing and production operations around the world, which allow us to serve our global customer base. As of December 31, 2018, our production facilities included 30 manufacturing plants (which included a total of 75 production units) at 23 sites across 12 countries, including the Company’s joint venture. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we operated 10 research and development (“R&D”) facilities globally, including technology and innovation development centers and pilot plants and coaters, which we believe are critical to our global presence and innovation capabilities. Our significant global operations also provide diversity in the end markets for our products.

 Our Strategy
 We believe that there are significant opportunities to improve our business globally and enhance our position as a leading global materials company engaged in the manufacture and marketing of standard, specialty and technologically differentiated emulsion polymers and plastics. The Company’s business strategy is to grow both organically and through the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and joint ventures that have attractive risk-adjusted returns that extend our leadership positions in attractive markets and geographies, while also achieving cost efficiencies across our businesses and making strategic divestures or closures of non-performing businesses and geographies. The Company’s organic growth will be developed through strategic capital investments to extend our leadership position in select market segments and by innovation that provides technological differentiation to our customers who seek our technological and development capabilities to create specialty grades, new and sustainable products, and technologically differentiated formulations.
 In order to support the Company’s strategic growth, we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial position with appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity. The Company employs a disciplined approach to capital allocation and deployment of cash that strives to balance the growth of our business and continued cash generation while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. For 2018, this included increasing our quarterly dividend to shareholders by more than 10% in June 2018, from $0.36 to $0.40 per share, and using $142.9 million in cash to repurchase approximately 2.2 million ordinary shares, about 5% of our ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.
 The priorities for uses of available cash include the servicing of our debt, the continued return of capital to our shareholders via quarterly dividends, the repurchase of our ordinary shares, and the funding of targeted growth initiatives. Management believes that strong cash flow generation, continued profitability, and spending discipline are critical to providing the Company with the ongoing flexibility to pursue our business strategy.
 For more information regarding our strategic highlights see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2018 Highlights.
 Business Segments
 Through December 31, 2017, the Company operated under six reporting segments: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Performance Plastics, Basic Plastics, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company realigned our reporting segments to reflect the new model under which the business is being managed and results are being reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company’s chief operating decision maker. 
 Under this new segmentation, we present operating results for six segments, four of which remain unchanged from the Company’s prior segmentation: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Feedstocks, and Americas Styrenics. The results of our Polystyrene business, which were previously included within the Basic Plastics segment, are now reported as a stand-alone segment. Performance Plastics, which previously consisted of compounds, blends, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (“ABS”) products sold to the automotive market, now includes the remaining portion of our ABS business, as well as the results of our styrene-acrylonitrile (“SAN”) and polycarbonate (“PC”) businesses. This segmentation change provides enhanced clarity to investors by concentrating the Company’s more specialized plastics into a single reporting segment, while also reducing complexity as PC and ABS are the primary inputs into the downstream production of our compounds and blends.
 Prior period financial information included within this Annual Report has been recast from its previous presentation to reflect the Company’s new organizational structure.
 Refer to Note 19 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment, which is the performance metric used by management to evaluate our segments’ performance, as well as sales and long-lived assets by geographic area. 
 Latex Binders Segment 
 Overview 
 We are a global leader in styrene-butadiene latex (“SB latex”), holding a strong market position across the geographies and applications in which we compete, including the #2 position in SB latex capacity in Europe and the #1 position in capacity in North America. In 2018, approximately 43% of our Latex Binders segment’s sales were generated in Europe, 27% were generated in the United States, and the majority of the remaining net sales were generated in Asia.

 Products and End Uses 
 We hold the #1 position for supplying SB latex for the coated paper market globally. SB latex is widely used as a binder for mineral pigments as it allows high coating speeds, improved smoothness, higher gloss level, opacity and water resistance that is valued in the product’s end use in advertising, magazines, and packaging board coatings.
 We are also a leading supplier of latex binders to the carpet and artificial turf industries and offer a diverse range of products for use in residential and commercial broadloom, needlefelt, and woven carpet backings. We produce high solids SB latex, styrene-acrylate latex (“SA latex”), vinylidene chloride, and butadiene-methacrylate latex products for the commercial and niche carpet markets. SB latex is also used in flooring as an adhesive for carpet and artificial turf fibers.
 We also offer a broad range of performance latex products, including SB latex, SA latex, and vinylidene chloride latex primarily for the adhesive, building and construction as well as the technical textile paper market, and have begun to implement the use of starch and associated new chemistries in paper coatings and carpet backing.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Latex Binders segment include BASF Group, Omnova Solutions Inc., and Synthomer plc. In this segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. We also believe our growth prospects could be enhanced if the recent trend of industry capacity reduction and consolidation continues.
 We believe our Latex Binders segment is able to differentiate itself by offering customers value-added formulation and product development expertise. Our R&D team and Technical Services and Development (“TS&D”) team are able to use our two pilot coating facilities in Switzerland and the United States, three paper fabrication and testing labs in China, Switzerland and the United States, three carpet technology centers located near carpet producers in China, the United States and Switzerland, and two product development and process research centers, one each in Germany and the United States, to assist customers in designing new products and enhancing the manufacturing process. Many of our major customers rely on our dedicated R&D and TS&D teams to complement their limited in-house resources for formulation and reformulation tests and trials. We believe that this capability allows us to capture new business, strengthen our existing customer relationships and broaden our technological expertise. 
 Additionally, our global manufacturing capabilities are key in serving customers cost-effectively, as latex binders are costly to ship over long distances due to their high water content. We believe that our global network of service and manufacturing facilities is highly valued by our customers. We seek to capture the value of our R&D and TS&D services and manufacturing capabilities through our pricing strategy. In 2018, we estimate that more than half of net sales in this segment related to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses.
 Seasonality
 Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance in our Latex Binders segment. Synthetic Rubber Segment 
 Overview 
 We are a significant producer of styrene-butadiene and polybutadiene-based rubber products and we have a leading European market position, providing approximately 52% of Western Europe’s solution styrene butadiene rubber (“SSBR”) capacity available for sale. While substantially all of our net sales were generated in Europe in 2018, approximately 21% of these net sales were exported to Asia, 12% to North America, and 5% to Latin America. Products and End Uses 
 Our Synthetic Rubber segment produces synthetic rubber products used in high-performance tires, impact modifiers and technical rubber products, such as conveyor belts, hoses, seals and gaskets. We participate significantly in the European synthetic rubber industry, where tire producers focus on high-performance and ultra high-performance tires 

 
  7

 
and rely heavily on their rubber suppliers. This is in contrast to North America, where tire manufacturers produce most of their required rubber. We have a broad synthetic rubber technology and product portfolio, focusing on specialty products, such as SSBR, while also producing core products, such as emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber (“ESBR”). Our synthetic rubber products are extensively used in tires, with approximately 88% of our net sales from this segment in 2018 attributable to the tire market. We have strong relationships with many of the top global tire manufacturers and believe we have remained a supplier of choice as a result of our broad rubber portfolio and ability to offer technologically differentiated product and product customization capabilities. Other applications for our synthetic rubber products include polymer modification and technical rubber goods.
 SSBR. We sell SSBR products for high-performance and ultra high-performance tire applications. We produce both clear and oil extended SSBR through batch polymerization in our four SSBR production lines. We believe these processes provide leading and technologically differentiated solutions to tire manufacturers.
 During the last several years, we have been working closely with major tire producers around the world to develop multiple new SSBR grades, addressing key marketplace needs for improved tire fuel economy, grip, and abrasion characteristics, which we believe will lead to significant demand growth for our rubber products in Europe and around the world. We expect our synthetic rubber product mix to continue to shift to more advanced SSBR grades (noting approximately 12% of our total Synthetic Rubber segment volume sold in 2012, compared to 34% in 2018) in order to meet this shift in product demand. In 2018, SSBR represented approximately 60% of total segment net sales.
 Performance tires represent an especially attractive market to rubber producers because they provide substantial value to end customers. In fact, the market for performance tires is expected to grow at a rate of 6-8% in 2019, which is approximately two to three times that of the total tire market. Tire manufacturers are expected to continually seek improvements in advanced rubber, which optimizes the combination of fuel economy and wet grip in order to meet EU regulations which set minimum requirements and are being phased in through 2020. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are considering similar legislation and are also beginning to adopt the tire labeling requirements that have become mandatory in Europe. We believe our growth prospects are enhanced by increasing demand for high-performance tires, which as a result of regulatory reforms aimed at improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the EU, Japan, and Korea, are now more commonly used by automakers as original equipment manufacturer specified tires in their vehicles.
 ESBR. Our ESBR products are used in standard tires, technical goods, and footwear. Our ESBR product portfolio offers tire producers a comprehensive suite of synthetic rubber capabilities. For example, ESBR provides enhanced wet grip to tire treads and strength to the inner liner of tires, allowing the tires to be more easily processed. In 2018, ESBR represented approximately 33% of total segment net sales.
 Ni-PBR and Nd-PBR. In November 2015, we completed the conversion of our nickel polybutadiene rubber (“Ni-PBR”) production capacity at our Schkopau, Germany facility to a swing line, allowing for the production of both Ni-PBR and neodymium polybutadiene rubber (“Nd-PBR”). We sell Ni-PBR products for use in standard tires, performance tires, technical goods, and footwear. Nd-PBR is a key material in the latest generation of performance tires, and is also sold for use in industrial rubber goods and polymer modification. In 2018, Ni-PBR and Nd-PBR represented in aggregate approximately 7% of total segment net sales.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Synthetic Rubber segment include Asahi Kasei Corporation, JSR Corporation, ARLANXEO, Zeon Corporation, Kumho Petrochemical Co., Ltd., PetroChina Company Limited, Reliance Rubber Industries, Sinopec Corp., Versalis S.p.A and Synthos S.A. In our Synthetic Rubber segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. We maintain deep and long-standing relationships with a large number of multinational customers, including many of the top global tire manufacturers, as well as fast growing Asian tire manufacturers. Our relationships with our top customers, including with our predecessor business operated by Dow prior to the Acquisition (as defined in Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements), range from 10 to more than 20 years. In 2018, our top three customers in this segment accounted for 56% of segment net sales. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Synthetic Rubber segment.
 We believe that we are a supplier of choice to our customers, given our broad rubber portfolio, including technologically differentiated grades, and our product customization capabilities. Our R&D and TS&D teams use our 

 
  8

 
broad rubber portfolio to develop differentiated specialty products for customers. Once implemented with a customer, these newly-developed specialty products cannot be easily replaced with a competitor’s product. As a result, we believe customers are likely to buy from us throughout the life cycle of specific tire models to avoid high switching costs and prevent repetition of the expensive development process.
 Enhanced SSBR, which includes later generations of SSBR and functionalized SSBR and is used in the new generation of performance tires, is expected to approach 50% of the total SSBR market by 2019. We believe the Company is well-positioned to capture additional market share in the high-growth, high-performance tire application markets. We expect that demand for enhanced SSBR will grow at a rate in excess of supply, resulting in an expected increase in industry utilization rates over the next five years. 
 In order to address this anticipated demand, the Company has added 125 kilotons (“KT”) of SSBR capacity since 2012, including additional SSBR capacity that came online in January 2018 at our Schkopau, Germany facility. In 2018, the Company also opened a new SSBR rubber pilot plant that allows us to expedite the product development process from lab sample to commercialization by delivering sufficient quantities of new formulations without the need to interrupt production in our industrial lines.
 While we export our rubber products worldwide, our production facilities currently are solely in Europe.  Therefore, we may face competitive challenges with customers who would prefer local manufacturers. In 2018, we estimate that approximately three quarters of net sales in this segment related to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses.
 Seasonality 
 Our Synthetic Rubber segment experiences some seasonality with its highest period of demand typically occurring during the first quarter of the year as inventories are built ahead of the summer season. The lowest period of demand normally occurs during the third quarter of the year due to the summer holidays. Performance Plastics Segment 
 Overview
 Our Performance Plastics segment consists of a variety of compounds and blends, and also includes our ABS, SAN, and PC businesses. We are a producer of highly engineered compounds and blends for automotive end markets, as well as consumer electronics, medical, electrical, lighting, building and construction, and appliances. Additionally this segment includes the results of API Applicazioni Plastiche Industriali S.p.A. (“API Plastics”), a manufacturer of soft-touch polymers and bioplastics, such as thermoplastic elastomers (“TPEs”), which we acquired in July 2017. In 2018, approximately 59% of our Performance Plastics segment’s net sales were generated in Europe, approximately 21% were generated in the United States, and approximately 14% were generated in Asia, with the remainder in other geographic areas, including Mexico and Canada. Products and End Uses 
 Our Performance Plastics segment consists of compounds and blends and some specialized ABS grades; SAN; PC; polypropylene; and thermoplastic elastomers. 
 Copolymers. Our copolymers products consist of ABS and SAN. In 2018, copolymers represented approximately 47% of total segment net sales. 
 We are a leading producer of ABS in Europe and are one of the few producers with a presence in North America. We produce mass ABS (“mABS”), a variation of ABS that has lower conversion and capital costs compared to the more common emulsion ABS (“eABS”) process, marketed under our MAGNUM™ brand. mABS has similar properties to eABS but has greater colorability, thermal stability and lower gloss. mABS products can be manufactured to stricter specifications because they are produced in a continuous process as opposed to the batch process used in eABS. mABS also has environmental benefits such as waste reduction and higher yields. In addition to our own mABS production capacity, we have licensed our proprietary mABS technology to other producers. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced the successful start-up of a MAGNUM™ ABS production line at our manufacturing plant at the Zhangjiagang, China site, which added additional regional production capabilities in order to meet customer needs for MAGNUM™ ABS in the Asia Pacific automotive, appliance, electronics, lighting and consumer goods markets.

 Primary end uses for our ABS products include automotive and construction sheet applications. We maintain a significant share of ABS sales into these markets, which we believe is due to the differentiating attributes of our mABS products, our reputation as a knowledgeable supplier, our broad product mix and our customer collaboration and design capabilities. 
 SAN is composed of styrene and acrylonitrile, which together provide clarity, stiffness, enhanced ability to be processed, mechanical strength, barrier properties, chemical resistance and heat resistance. SAN is used mainly in appliances, consumer goods and construction sheets, due to its low-cost, clarity and chemical resistance properties. 
 PC & Compounding. Our PC & Compounding products consist of PC/ABS compounds, PC blends, and PC and polypropylene blends. In 2018, PC & Compounding represented approximately 49% of total segment net sales.
 PC has high levels of clarity, impact resistance and temperature resistance. PC can be used in its neat form (prior to any compounding or blending) for markets such as construction sheet, optical media and LED lighting. Additionally, PC can be compounded or blended with other polymers, such as ABS, which imparts specific performance attributes tailored to the product’s end-use.
 Our products for glazing and construction sheets are marketed under the CALIBRE™ brand name and offer customers a combination of clarity, heat resistance and impact performance. Glazing and construction sheet represents our largest PC application, and is a key growth focus for us. Key end-markets include the construction industry, with additional opportunities for growth with compounded products in the medical device market, consumer electronics and other applications such as smart meter casings that require plastics with enhanced weatherability, ignition resistance and impact performance. 
 We have a significant position in PC/ABS blends, which combine the heat resistance and impact strength of PC with the easy-to-process qualities and resilience of ABS. Our Performance Plastics segment also compounds and blends our PC and ABS plastics into differentiated products for customers, as well as compounds of polypropylene. We have also developed compounds containing post-consumer recycled polymers to respond to what we believe is a growing need for some customers to include recycled content in their products. We believe our ability to offer technologically differentiated products to meet customer needs sets us apart from our competitors, and with our history as a leading innovator in compounds and blends, we have established ourselves as a leading supplier of PC-based products.
 For the automotive industry, we manufacture PC/ABS blends under the PULSE™ brand, and we innovate collaboratively with our customers to develop performance solutions to meet the industry’s needs, such as reducing the weight of vehicles. As a result, we are a key supplier of these products to leading automotive companies in North America and Europe, who tend to specify these products on a per car program platform basis, making it difficult to be displaced as a supplier once selected and providing us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows for several years during the production lifecycle. We are also accelerating our development of similar supply capabilities in additional geographies, like China. 
 For the consumer electronics, electrical and lighting and medical device industries, we manufacture our products under the EMERGE™ brand, among others, and we believe that we have growth opportunities in tablets, notebooks, smart phones and other handheld devices, and electrical and lighting and medical device components. In serving these markets, we leverage our polymer and compound technologies to meet increasingly stringent performance requirements along with the aesthetic and color-matching requirements which are crucial characteristics for the products involved.
 API Plastics. Through our acquisition of API Plastics in 2017, we have added TPEs and other soft polymers to our product offerings for the automotive industry. In 2018, API Plastics represented approximately 4% of total segment net sales.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Performance Plastics segment are Covestro AG, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, Borealis AG, Celanese Corporation, Shanghai Kumho Sunny Plastics Co., Ltd., Shanghai Pret Composites Co. Ltd., INEOS Styrolution, Lotte Chemical Corporation, and LyondellBasell. In our Performance Plastics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our customer relationships.
 We believe potential growth in the Performance Plastic segment will be impacted by a number of factors, including consumer preference for lighter weight and impact-resistant products and the development of new consumer 

 
  10

 
electronics and continuing growth in medical device applications. Additionally, we believe growth prospects are bolstered by sustainability trends, such as the substitution of lighter-weight plastics for metal in automobiles. Therefore, we believe our history of innovation and our focus on differentiated products enhances our growth prospects in this segment. Our innovation has contributed to long-standing relationships with customers who are recognized leaders in their respective end-markets. We also believe our global facilities are a competitive advantage that allows us to provide customers with consistent grades across markets and positions us to strategically serve emerging markets.
 However, for PC, we have a lower competitive position than our peers, which may ultimately impact our ability to implement an effective pricing strategy. Of all the styrene derivative products, ABS has the highest projected growth rate over the next five years, which is expected to outpace supply, resulting in increasing operating rates. 
 Seasonality
  Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance in our Performance Plastics segment. Polystyrene Segment
 Overview 
 We are a leading producer of polystyrene and focus on sales to injection molding and thermoforming customers. We do not anticipate investing in strategic growth initiatives in this segment in the near term. In 2018, approximately 60% of net sales from our Polystyrene segment were generated in Europe and 40% of net sales were generated in Asia. Products and End Uses 
 Our product offerings include a variety of general purpose polystyrenes (“GPPS”) and high impact polystyrene (“HIPS”), which is polystyrene that has been modified with polybutadiene rubber to increase its impact resistant properties. These products provide customers with performance and aesthetics at a low cost across applications, including appliances, packaging, including food packaging and food service disposables, consumer electronics and building and construction materials.
 We believe our STYRON™ brand is one of the longest established brands in the industry and is widely recognized in the global marketplace. We believe our R&D capabilities provide valuable, differentiated solutions for our customers, making us well-positioned to address the sustainability, weight reduction, and safety needs.
 Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Polystyrene segment are INEOS Styrolution, Versalis S.p.A., Total S.p.A., Covestro AG, LG Chem Ltd., Elix Polymers, Sinopec Corp., Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp., and Chi Mei Corporation. In this segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer reliable products as well as the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. 
 Our customer-centric model focuses on understanding customers’ needs and developing tailored relationships that add an additional value over the value of the actual product performance. For durable applications, we focus our TS&D, R&D and marketing teams on product design engineering initiatives for developing and specifying plastics in the next generation of construction applications, and appliances. In non-durable applications, we focus on innovative products that provide clear cost advantages to our customers, serving customers with our cost-advantaged technology and operating excellence. We have leveraged industry-leading product development and technology capabilities in many of our product lines in this segment to develop long-standing customer relationships with many of our customers, including a number who have purchased from us, including our predecessor business operated by Dow for more than 20 years. We believe that our asset footprint is an advantage, allowing us to provide customers with consistent product grades and positioning us to strategically serve growth economies. 
 Seasonality
 Due to the geographic diversity of the Company’s customers and end-markets for our polystyrene products across the globe, our Polystyrene segment does not typically experience material levels of seasonality. However, sales volumes 

 
  11

 
may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as customers may adjust their purchase patterns based on their expectations of polystyrene price changes. 
 Feedstocks Segment
 Overview
 Our Feedstocks segment is primarily focused on the revenue and profitability related to the Company’s production and procurement of styrene monomer outside of North America. The Feedstocks segment supplied 15% of the styrene monomer capacity out of Europe in 2018. In 2019, the Company expects to produce approximately 700 KT of styrene in Western Europe and purchase approximately 60 KT of styrene in Asia on a raw material cost basis.  Products and End Uses
 Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SAN resins, SA latex, SB latex, ABS resins, unsaturated polyethylene resins, and styrene-butadiene rubber.  Competition and Customers 
 Our principal competitors in our Feedstocks segment are: INEOS Styrolution, Versalis S.p.A., Total S.p.A., BASF SE, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, LyondellBasell, Repsol S.A., Sinopec Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell plc. The majority of styrene monomer produced within the Feedstocks segment is consumed by the Company in our own manufacturing activities.
 Global styrene operating rates were approximately 89% in 2018 and we believe operating rates will increase through 2020 due to continued demand growth, an aging industry asset base, and limited new capacity. These relatively high operating rates can result in periods of elevated margins due to planned or unplanned production outages. Additional capacity is expected to come online which could lower operating rates early in the next decade, but there is uncertainty around the quantity and timing of future capacity expansions and the net impact of future potential capacity closures. 
 Seasonality
 Our Feedstocks segment does not generally experience material levels of seasonality affecting sales volumes; however, there may be seasonal fluctuations in margin as planned supply outages generally occur more often in the spring and fall seasons. Americas Styrenics Segment
 Overview 
 This segment consists solely of the operations of our 50%-owned joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, Americas Styrenics LLC (“Americas Styrenics”), which continues to be a leading producer in North America of both styrene and polystyrene. In fact, in 2018 Americas Styrenics was the #1 producer of polystyrene and supplied 18% of the styrene monomer capacity in North America. We received a total of $117.5 million in cash dividends from Americas Styrenics during 2018. We estimate that the contribution to our equity earnings from Americas Styrenics’ polystyrene business was approximately 32% in 2018, 40% in 2017, and 51% in 2016. This translates to a contribution from Americas Styrenics’ polystyrene business to our Adjusted EBITDA of approximately 8% in 2018, 8% in 2017, and 11% in 2016. Products and End Uses
 Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, and in 2018 approximately 58% of the styrene monomer produced by Americas Styrenics was consumed in its own production of polystyrene. The remainder of Americas Styrenics’ product is sold as a key raw material to other manufacturers of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SB latex, ABS resins, unsaturated polyethylene resins, and styrene-butadiene rubber. 

 
  12

 

 Americas Styrenics also produces GPPS, high heat, high impact resin, and STYRON A-TECH™ polystyrene products. Major applications for these polystyrene products include appliances, food packaging, food service disposables, consumer electronics and building and construction materials.
 Competition and Customers
 Americas Styrenics’ principal competitors are INEOS Styrolution, Total S.p.A., and LyondellBasell. In our Americas Styrenics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer reliable products as well as the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships.
 As a leading styrenics producer in North America, this segment is well-positioned to benefit from consolidation dynamics in the styrene and polystyrene industries within the region. With global utilization rates expected to steadily improve as demand grows in end-markets, we believe opportunities will be created for us, given our scale and geographic reach that will benefit the Americas Styrenics segment. However, like many of competitors in the styrenics market, the aged assets associated with this segment may result in unplanned outages that may adversely impact our service levels and competitive position.
 Seasonality
  Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance in our Americas Styrenics segment. Our Relationship with Dow 
 We have entered into certain agreements with Dow, including the Second Amended and Restated Master Outsourcing Services Agreement, which was modified on June 1, 2013 (“SAR MOSA”), the Amended and Restated MOD5 Computerized Process Control Software, Licenses and Services Agreement, with Rofan Services, Inc. which was modified on June 1, 2013 (“AR MOD5 Agreement”), site and operating services agreements (“SAR SSAs”), and supply agreements.
 The SAR MOSA provides for ongoing worldwide services from Dow, in areas such as information technology, enterprise resource planning, finance, environmental health and safety, training, customer service, marketing and sales support, supply chain and certain sourcing and transactional procurement services. This agreement is effective through December 31, 2020, with automatic two-year renewals, barring six-months’ notice of non-renewal provided by either party. The Company has the ability to terminate all or a portion of the services under the SAR MOSA, subject to payment of termination charges, with certain ‘highly integrated’ services following a separate process for evaluation and termination. In addition, either party may terminate for cause, for material breach which is not cured, or by Dow in the event of our failure to pay for the services thereunder. In the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement, Dow has the right to terminate the SAR MOSA.    We use SAP’s Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) software systems to support our operations worldwide and to manage our day-to-day business processes and relationships with customers and suppliers. Under the SAR MOSA, Dow provides us with ERP systems support, global data/voice network and server infrastructure for desktop computing, email, file sharing, intranet and internet website access, and mainframe and midrange computer access.
 During 2018, the Company began efforts to insource, and in some cases outsource to other vendors, certain information technology, procurement, supply chain, and ERP services and systems currently provided by Dow. Before the end of 2019, the Company expects to cease having Dow provide certain customer service and logistics activities, procurement services, and environmental health and safety activities, with certain information security and information technology services and systems to be transitioned thereafter. During 2018, the Company incurred $26.1 million in costs related to our transition of these services away from Dow, of which $5.7 million was capitalized and $20.4 million was recognized as expense. The Company expects to incur further significant costs related to transitioning services away from Dow.
 Under the AR MOD5 Agreement, Dow provides worldwide process control technology, including hardware, software licenses and support services, and related enterprise resource planning services. The AR MOD5 Agreement, with a term through December 2020, may be terminated by either party for cause, which includes a bankruptcy, 

 
  13

 
liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, for material breach which is not cured by us if we no longer wish to receive maintenance and support for any licensed software; or by Dow if we use the licensed software for any purposes other than Company business. Dow may terminate the maintenance and support terms at any time if we fail to make payments when due and the default is not corrected within 30 days from notice, or upon two-years’ written notice to us, if Dow has made the decision not to support the software systems, provided that Dow will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in locating and transitioning to an alternate service provider. While we are not permitted to use this automation technology for new plants or to substantially expand existing plants, we can use other technology solutions for those situations. As of December 31, 2018, we have converted approximately half of our plants from the AR MOD5 process control technology through a strategic external relationship with ABB Ltd. and expect to convert six additional plants in 2019, with the remainder of our plants converted thereafter.
 In addition, we entered into various site services agreements with Dow to provide site services to the Company at Dow owned sites, which were modified as of June 1, 2013 (the “Amendment Date”). Conversely, we entered into similar agreements with Dow in June 2010, where at Company owned sites, we provide such services to Dow. These SAR SSAs cover general services that are provided at specific facilities co-located with Dow, rather than organization-wide services, and include utilities, site administration, environmental health and safety, site maintenance and supply chain. In certain circumstances, the parties may adjust certain prices and volumes. These agreements generally have 25-year terms from the Amendment Date, with options to renew. These agreements may be terminated at any time by agreement of the parties, or, by either party, for cause, including a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding by the other party, or under certain circumstances for a material breach which is not cured. In addition, we may terminate for convenience any services that Dow has agreed to provide to us that are identified in any site services agreement as “terminable” with 12-months’ prior notice to Dow, dependent upon whether the service is highly integrated into Dow operations. Highly integrated services are agreed to be nonterminable. With respect to “nonterminable” services that Dow has agreed to provide to us, such as electricity and steam, we generally cannot terminate such services prior to the termination date unless we experience a production unit shut down for which we provide Dow with 15-months’ prior notice, or upon payment of a shutdown fee. Upon expiration or termination, we would be obligated to pay a monthly fee to Dow, which obligation extends for a period of 45 (in the case of expiration) to 60 months (in the case of termination) following the respective event of each site services agreement. The agreements under which Dow receives services from us may be terminated under the same circumstances and conditions.
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we incurred a total of $265.1 million, $236.4 million, and $224.7 million, respectively, in expenses under the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and site services agreements (which include utilities), including $210.8 million, $183.3 million, and $174.8 million, respectively, for both the variable and fixed cost components of the site services agreements and $54.3 million, $53.1 million, and $49.9 million, respectively, covering all other agreements.
 In addition, at the date of the Acquisition, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement pursuant to which we operate and maintain our SAN facility in Midland, Michigan to produce products for Dow. This agreement has a 25-year term, with automatic renewals for five-year terms unless one party gives notice at least 18 months prior to the end of the period. We may terminate any operational service under the agreement in the event that we experience a production unit shutdown, with 15-months’ prior notice to Dow. Furthermore, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement between the parties, by either party on notice that the other party fails to cure non-performance or if the other party is in material breach of a material obligation under the agreement within certain parameters, or because of either party’s insolvency.
 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, purchases and other charges from Dow and its affiliated companies (excluding the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and site services agreements) were approximately $1,145.5 million, $1,120.8 million, and $865.7 million, respectively. These purchases and other charges primarily relate to the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing of our products, as discussed further below. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, sales to Dow and its affiliated companies were approximately $248.4 million, $235.2 million, and $203.5 million, respectively.
 We continue to leverage Dow’s scale and operational capabilities by procuring certain raw materials, utilities, site services, and other information technology and business services from Dow. In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into several agreements with Dow relating to the provision of certain products and services and other operational arrangements. Dow provides significant operating and other services, and certain raw materials used in the production of our products, under agreements that are important to our business. The failure of Dow to perform their obligations, or the 

 
  14

 
termination of these agreements, could adversely affect our operations. Significant capital expenditures would be required to integrate these capabilities into our own operations. See Item 1A—Risk Factors.
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 The prices of our key raw materials are volatile and can fluctuate significantly over time. While the predominant reason for this volatility is the impact of market imbalances in supply and demand from time to time, energy prices may also impact the volatility of some of our raw materials. The table below shows our key raw materials by reporting segment.
 | Latex | Synthetic | Performance | | | Americas 
 | Binders | Rubber | Plastics | Polystyrene | Feedstocks | Styrenics
Benzene | | | | | X | X 
Bisphenol A | | | X | | | 
Butadiene | X | X | | | | 
Ethylene | | | | | X | X 
Polycarbonate | | | X | | | 
Styrenic resins | | | X | | | 
Styrene | X | X | X | X | X | X 

  We have supply contracts in place to help maintain our supply of raw materials at competitive market prices and seek to implement the most efficient and reliable raw material strategy for each of our segments, including maintaining a balance between contracted and spot purchases of raw materials. We also produce raw materials for use by our businesses, such as styrene monomer. 
 In 2018, we obtained approximately 31% of our raw materials from Dow (based on aggregate purchase price). While Dow provides a significant portion of our raw materials to us pursuant to supply agreements, we have developed a comprehensive strategy for obtaining additional sources of supply where needed. Our 2010 agreements with Dow for ethylene, benzene, and butadiene have 10-year terms with automatic two-year renewal provisions. Minimum and maximum monthly contract quantities were established based on historical consumption rates, and our pricing terms are based on commodity indices in the relevant geography. 
 In 2018, Dow supplied us with approximately 96% of our benzene requirements and 100% of our ethylene requirements through 10-year contracts that commenced in 2010 and include automatic two-year renewal provisions. Dow is our largest supplier for these materials in Europe, where we purchase directly from Dow’s existing butadiene extraction facilities pursuant to the terms of a 10-year contract that commenced in 2010 and includes an automatic two-year renewal term. Other supply sources in Europe include major producers with contract terms of up to five years at competitive market prices. Supply to North America and Asia are exclusively from other major third party producers via supply contracts.
 In addition to purchasing styrene through long-term strategic contracts and spot market purchases, we produce styrene internally from purchased ethylene and benzene at our own manufacturing sites. These sources provided 36%, 17%, and 48%, respectively, of our supply in 2018. With this mix of purchased and produced styrene, we seek to optimize our overall costs of securing styrene through efficient logistics, manufacturing economics and market dynamics.
 Bisphenol A (“BPA”) is the major raw material associated with PC production. This raw material is produced by a subsidiary of Olin Corporation and is supplied via pipeline to us through a supply contract in Europe that has an initial term expiring in December 2019.
 Technology 
 Our R&D and TS&D activities across our segments focus on identifying needs in our customers’ end-markets. As part of our customer-centric model, our R&D/TS&D organization interfaces with our sales and marketing teams and 

 
  15

 
directly with customers to determine their product requirements in light of trends in their industries and market segments. This information is used to select R&D/TS&D projects that are value-enhancing for both our customers and us.
 Our innovation and technology centers support our technological and R&D/TS&D capabilities. In addition, our R&D/TS&D efforts are also supported by our two SB latex pilot coaters and certain “mini-plants” operated by our businesses in Stade and Schkopau, Germany. These mini plants are used to make samples of experimental products for testing, which we believe is a critical step in our new product development process. In addition, in 2017, we opened a new Plastics Research Center, which modernized two existing technical support centers and research lab operations in a single location at our Terneuzen, The Netherlands office location.
 R&D and TS&D costs are included in expenses as incurred. Our R&D and TS&D costs were $56.0 million, $54.3 million, and $50.1 million, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We have a customer-centric business model that has helped us to develop strong relationships with many customers. Our sales and marketing professionals are primarily located at our facilities or at virtual offices within their respective geographies. We have approximately 161 professionals working in sales and marketing around the world, along with approximately 80 customer service professionals and we sell our products to customers in approximately 80 countries. We primarily market our products through our direct sales force. Typically our direct sales are made by our employees in the regions closest to the given customer. Intellectual Property 
 We evaluate on a case-by-case basis how best to utilize patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property in order to protect our products and our critical investments in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. We focus on securing and maintaining patents for certain inventions, while maintaining other inventions as trade secrets, derived from our customer-centric business model, in an effort to maximize the value of our product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities. Our policy is to seek appropriate protection for significant product and process developments in the major markets where the relevant products are manufactured or sold. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product uses. Patents extend for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of subject matter covered by the patent and the scope of the claims of the patent.
 In most industrial countries, patent protection may be available for new substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production processes. However, given the geographical scope of our business and our continued growth strategy, there are regions of the world in which we do business or may do business in the future where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. These information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee awareness training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors’ products and, if circumstances were to dictate that we do so, we would vigorously challenge the actions of others that conflict with our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
 The technologies we utilize in some of our business lines have been in use for many years (e.g., SB latex and ABS) and a number of our patents relating to such technologies have expired or will expire in within the next several years. As patents expire, or are allowed to lapse, the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public. We believe that the expiration of any single patent or family of patents that is scheduled to expire in the next three years would not materially adversely affect our business or financial results. We believe that our trade secrets relating to manufacturing and other processes used in connection with products to which expiring patents relate will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage after the expiration of these patents.
 We use trademarks as a means of differentiating our products. We protect our trademarks against infringement where we deem appropriate. We have successfully registered the TRINSEO™ trademark in over 90 countries and have other trademark applications pending.

 Dow has either transferred to us or granted perpetual, royalty-free licenses to us to use Dow’s intellectual property that was used by Dow to operate the Styron business prior to the Acquisition. This intellectual property includes certain processes, compositions and apparatus used in the manufacture of our products. In addition to our license rights to use Dow’s intellectual property related to the Styron business, we have obtained licenses to use Dow’s intellectual property to the extent necessary to perform our obligations under the contracts transferred to us in the Acquisition and to use such intellectual property (other than patents) for products outside of the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow prior to the Acquisition, subject to certain limitations. While we believe our license rights with respect to Dow’s intellectual property are sufficient to allow us to operate our current business, new growth opportunities in latex binders, and to a lesser extent plastics, involving new products may fall outside of our license rights with Dow. Therefore, our ability to develop new products may be impacted by intellectual property rights that have not been licensed to us by Dow. We have the right, with Dow’s cooperation, to directly enforce the patents that are exclusively licensed to us by Dow where infringement is primarily within the scope of our business; but nothing obligates Dow to enforce against third parties the intellectual property rights of Dow that are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis or where the infringement is primarily outside the scope of our business.
 Since our formation on June 17, 2010, we have focused our product innovation on our product lines within the Company’s Synthetic Rubber, Latex Binders and Performance Plastics segments. The intellectual property that we have created or acquired since the Acquisition is largely in these segments and covers areas such as material formulations, material process technologies and various end-use industrial applications.
 Environmental, Health, Safety and Product Stewardship 
 Obtaining, producing and distributing many of our products involve the use, storage, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. We are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, which address, among other things, the following:
· | emissions to the air;
--+----------------------


· | discharges to soils and surface and subsurface waters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | other releases into the environment;
--+-------------------------------------


· | prevention, remediation or abatement of releases of hazardous materials into the indoor or outdoor environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | climate change impacts;
--+------------------------


· | process and maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | registration and evaluation of chemicals;
--+------------------------------------------


· | production, handling, labeling or use of chemicals used or produced by us; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | stewardship of products after manufacture.
--+-------------------------------------------

  We monitor compliance with applicable state, national, and international environmental, health and safety requirements and maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, which may in some circumstances exceed the requirements imposed by applicable law. We have a strong environmental, health and safety organization with a staff of professionals who are responsible for environmental, health, safety and product regulatory compliance and stewardship in addition to the standards, tools and services purchased from Dow. We supplement our programs and Dow’s services with our participation in trade associations which monitor developments in legislation impacting our businesses. Additionally, our Supplier Code of Conduct includes our expectations for our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and encourages them to adhere to the highest principles of environmental responsibility.
 We follow the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care® Guiding Principles for our global facilities and products and last received third party certification of our Responsible Care® Management System in September 2016. Many of our facilities have been certified to ISO 14001 and other ISO management systems. We have a mature corporate environmental, health and safety audit program for all of our facilities. We focus on emergency preparedness and crisis planning and drills, at both the facility and corporate level. We expect that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and our industry in general.

 Sustainability and Climate Change
 We recognize that climate change has had and will continue to have significant impacts on our environment, particularly as it relates to extreme weather conditions, rising sea levels, and regulations limiting the emission of greenhouse gases. In the countries in which we operate, particularly in the EU, we are required to comply with increasingly extensive regulations to address climate change impacts and resource conservation requirements.
 We track and publicly report our greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and energy consumptions and our facilities work to improve our performance at reducing chemical emissions, water usage and energy consumption. Our Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which is available on our website, provides our most recent sustainability highlights for our products, performance and operations. The report highlights our initiatives to improve our sustainability performance. We do not expect the costs to comply with legislation enacted as a result of climate change and other sustainability efforts will be material to our operations and consolidated financial position in the next 12 months.
 Environmental Remediation
 Environmental laws and regulations require mitigation or remediation of the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances. Under some of these regulations, as the current owner or operator of a property, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on or under the property, without regard to whether we knew of or caused the contamination, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were permitted at the time they occurred. At our Allyn’s Point, Connecticut property we lease a portion of the property to our joint venture, Americas Styrenics, for its operations, which includes a regulated hazardous waste boiler. Potential liabilities resulting from our owner status are addressed through financial assurance mechanisms and other agreements. Many of our production sites have an extended history of industrial use, and it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future. Soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of the sites, and might occur or be discovered at other sites. Subject to certain monetary and temporal limitations, Dow is obligated to indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to releases of hazardous material that existed at our sites prior to our separation from Dow in June 2010. However, we cannot be certain that Dow will fully honor the indemnity or that the indemnity will be sufficient to satisfy all claims that we may incur. In addition, we face the risk that future claims might fall outside of the scope of the indemnity, particularly if we experience a release of hazardous materials that occurs in the future or at any time after our separation from Dow. Except for minor monitoring activities that we are performing in Livorno, Italy pursuant to an agreement with Dow, we do not currently have any material obligations to perform environmental remediation on our properties, or for any Superfund site. Any active remedial projects on our properties are being performed by Dow pursuant to its indemnification obligations or for any Superfund sites. We conduct comprehensive environmental due diligence for potential acquisitions to mitigate the risk of assuming obligations to conduct material levels of environmental remediation. Security 
 We recognize the importance of security and safety to our employees and the community. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of technology) and emergency response preparedness into integrated security plans. We have conducted vulnerability assessments at our operating facilities in the U.S. and high priority sites worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical and cyber-attacks. Effort and resources in assessing security vulnerabilities and taking steps to reinforce security at our manufacturing facilities will continue to be required to comply with U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and other requirements.
 We use Dow’s information security program and systems and have expanded our own information security resources, policies, programs and preparedness to respond to potential information security breaches and to maintain compliance with the increasing amount of data privacy laws and regulation.

 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,500 employees worldwide. Nearly 68% of our personnel are located at the various manufacturing sites, research and development, pilot coating, paper fabrication and testing and technology centers. The remaining employees are located at operating centers, virtual locations or geographically dispersed marketing and sales locations. Our Midland, Michigan site is the only U.S. facility with union representation for its 48 hourly operations personnel, and employees at certain of our locations are represented by work councils. We consider relations with our personnel and the various labor organizations to be good. There have been no labor strikes or work stoppages in these locations in recent history. Available Information
