ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
On May 28, 2020, pursuant to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 19, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among AYRO, Inc., a Delaware corporation previously known as DropCar, Inc. (“DropCar”), ABC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and AYRO Operating Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation previously known as AYRO, Inc. (“AYRO Operating”), Merger Sub was merged with and into AYRO Operating, with AYRO Operating continuing after the merger as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” “AYRO” and “Company” refer to AYRO, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
We design and manufacture compact, sustainable electric vehicles for closed campus mobility, low speed urban and community transport, local on-demand and last mile delivery and government use. Our four-wheeled purpose-built electric vehicles are geared toward commercial customers, including universities, business and medical campuses, last mile delivery services and food service providers. We are currently updating our model year 2023 vehicle lineup in support of the aforementioned markets.
Strategic Review
 
Following the hiring of our current Chief Executive Officer in the third quarter of 2021, we initiated a strategic review of our product development strategy, as we focus on creating value within the electric vehicle, last-mile delivery, smart payload and enabling infrastructure markets. In connection with our strategic review, we have cancelled all material research and development activity and expenditures, associated with our planned next-generation three-wheeled high speed vehicle.
 
For the past several years, our primary supplier has been Cenntro Automotive Group, Ltd. (“Cenntro”), which operates a large electric vehicle factory in the automotive district in Hangzhou, China. As a result of rising shipping costs, quality issues with certain components and persistent delays, we ceased production of the AYRO 411x from Cenntro in September 2022 in order to focus our resources on the development and launch of the new 411 fleet vehicle model year 2023 refresh, the Vanish.
 
Products
 
Our vehicles provide the end user an environmentally friendly alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (cars powered by gasoline or diesel oil), for light duty uses, including low-speed logistics, maintenance services, cargo services, and personal/group transport in a quiet, zero emissions vehicle with a lower total cost of ownership.
AYRO 411x
 
The AYRO 411x is an electric, four-wheel, compact, light-duty utility trucks sold exclusively through our contracted partner, Club Car, as part of a global multi-year sustainability solution development, sales and marketing agreement.
 
AYRO Vanish
 
In December 2021, we began design and development of the Vanish, including updates to our supply chain evolution, the offshoring/onshoring mix, our manufacturing strategy and our annual model year refresh program. We unveiled the first Vanish prototype in the fourth quarter of 2022. Pre-production was completed in December 2022 and we expect to begin accepting pre-orders in the second quarter of 2023.
 
There will be three members of the AYRO Vanish fleet of vehicles (the “AYRO Vanish Fleet”):
 

● | The Vanish Cargo Van Box, a fully enclosed cargo box, which may be internally tailored for use; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Vanish Flatbed truck, which provides users with considerable versatility; and 
● | The Vanish Pickup truck, generally utilized for open air hauling.

Each member of the AYRO Vanish Fleet will be classified as a street legal low speed vehicle (“LSV”) or non-LSV variant, defined as a four wheeled motor vehicle, other than an all-terrain vehicle, that is capable of reaching speeds of at least 20 miles per hour (“mph”) but not greater than 25 mph. The AYRO Vanish Fleet is expected to have a maximum payload capacity of 1,500 pounds. The AYRO Vanish is 13 feet long and can use either a conventional 120V or 240V wall outlet or can be configured for a J1772 charger. The “non-LSV” variant has a higher payload capacity of 1,800 pounds.
 

● | All three platforms will share identical components on common chassis architectures 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Spare and maintenance parts will identical for all three platforms 
● | Communication, application, and web-enabled software 
● | Allows for conversion into an autonomous platform 
● | Cost savings from reduced fleet size, reduced insurance overhang, common logistics, and application-enabled operational efficiencies. 

 
The AYRO Vanish Fleet will have an expected range of over 50 miles and an expected maximum speed of 25 mph. in line with the United States Department of Transportation regulations for LSVs and with most state statutes, which typically limit the speed of LSVs to 25 mph or 35 mph posted roads.
 
The Company estimates that the AYRO Vanish Fleet’s operating costs will be approximately 50% lower per year compared to similarly sized gas-powered trucks and vans. The vehicles are primarily sourced from North America and Europe, with vehicle final assembly and integration occurring in our Round Rock, Texas facility, thus ameliorating concerns regarding rising costs of trans-Pacific shipping, shipping times, import duties and quality.
 
Additional Models, Vehicles, Payloads and Infrastructure
 
We continue to invest in expanding our existing all-electric vehicle technologies, reconfigurable cargo subsystems, onboard and web-based fleet support applications, driver support systems and applications, as well as architectural innovations that maximize subsystem commonality across the AYRO vehicle fleet. Our product line roadmap contemplates growing our fleet of purpose-engineered vehicles and services with every passing model year, with a focus on the low-speed vehicle segment, last mile delivery of a plurality of payloads, and potential line extension into efficient, safe micro-mobility platforms.
 
We are also currently in discussions with a key supply partner on positioning the model year 2023 Vanish for sale on the General Services Administration schedule (“GSA Schedule”). The GSA Schedule is a long-term government-wide contract with commercial companies that provides access to millions of commercial products and services at pre-negotiated prices. This would represent an increase of the total addressable market for the Company and further represent a demand hedge to the cyclicality of markets currently addressed.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain
 
Manufacturing Agreement with Cenntro
 
In 2017, AYRO Operating partnered with Cenntro in a supply chain agreement to provide sub-assembly manufacturing services. Cenntro owns the design of the AYRO Club Car 411 and 411x (“AYRO 411 Fleet”) vehicles and has granted us an exclusive license to purchase the AYRO 411 Fleet vehicles for sale in North America.
 
Under our Manufacturing License Agreement with Cenntro (the “Cenntro MLA”), in order for us to maintain our exclusive territorial rights pursuant to the Cenntro MLA, we must meet certain minimum purchase requirements.
 
We imported semi-knocked-down vehicle kits from Cenntro for the AYRO 411x models comprising our model year 2022 lineup. The vehicle kits were received through shipping containers at the assembly facility of Karma Automotive LLC (“Karma”), our previous manufacturing partner in southern California, as well as at our customization, service and integration facility in Round Rock, Texas. The vehicles were then assembled with tailored customization requirements per order.
 
On May 31, 2022, we received a letter from Cenntro purporting to terminate all agreements and contracts between the Company and Cenntro. Although we do not believe Cenntro’s termination of the Cenntro MLA is valid, we have determined to cease production of the AYRO 411x and focus our resources on the development and launch of the Vanish. We have canceled all purchase orders and future builds with Cenntro and currently intend to only order replacement parts for vehicles from Cenntro in the future. Cenntro inventory remaining on hand as of December 31, 2022 was $244,902. We expect to lose our exclusive license under the Cenntro MLA, in which case Cenntro could sell identical or similar products through other companies or directly to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
We intend for the new Vanish to utilize assemblies and products that will largely eliminate our dependency on Chinese imports and optimize the supply chain to rely primarily upon North American and European sources. Final assembly of the Vanish will occur in our Round Rock, Texas facilities.
 
Manufacturing Agreement with Linamar
 
On July 28, 2022, we partnered with Linamar Corporation (“Linamar”), a Canadian manufacturer, in a manufacturing agreement (the “Linamar MLA”) to provide certain sub assembly and assembly parts, including the cabin frame and skate for the Vanish (collectively, the “Products”). During the term of the Linamar MLA, Linamar has the exclusive right to supply the Products to the Company, subject to certain exceptions. The Linamar MLA has an initial term of three years and will automatically renew for successive two-year terms unless either party has given at least 12 months’ written notice of nonrenewal. Either party may terminate the Linamar MLA at any time upon 12 months’ written notice, and in the event of a change in control of the Company prior to the end of the initial term, we may terminate upon written notice within three days of completion of such change in control.
 
In the event we terminate the Linamar MLA prior to its expiration, whether following a change in control or otherwise, we must purchase any remaining raw material inventory, finished goods inventory and work in progress and any unamortized capital equipment used in production and testing of the Products and pay a termination fee of $750,000, subject to certain adjustments. We are dependent on the Linamar MLA, and in the event of its termination our manufacturing operations and customer deliveries would be materially impacted.
 
Under the Linamar MLA, we must commit to certain minimum purchases, to be determined by AYRO on a quarterly basis.
 
We import the Products from Linamar in Canada, and we manufacture and assemble the Vanish at our customization, service, and integration facility in Round Rock, Texas. Over 98% of the vehicle assemblies, components, and products are from North American and European sources.
 
Assembly and Integration
 
For assembly, tailoring, diagnostics testing and service of the Vanish, we currently occupy 24,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space configured in a “U”-shaped assembly line with multiple stations per vehicle in our Round Rock, Texas facility. The chart below indicates the estimated number of vehicles that can be assembled per month and the assembly time required for each. Assembly time also includes USDOT quality checks and testing as the final step of the assembly process. The number of vehicles indicated below assumes a single shift.

Vehicle | Assembly time (Man-Hours) | | Vehicle Assembly Capacity per month

Supply Agreement with Gallery Carts
 
During 2020, we entered into a supply agreement with Gallery Carts, a leading provider of food and beverage kiosks, carts, and mobile storefront solutions. Joint development efforts have led to the launch of the parties’ first all-electric configurable mobile hospitality vehicle for “on-the-go” venues across the United States. This innovative solution permits food, beverage and merchandising operators to bring goods directly to consumers.
 
The configurable Powered Vendor Box, in the rear of the vehicle, features long-life lithium batteries that power the preconfigured hot/cold beverage and food equipment is directly integrated with the 411x and will be directly integrated with the Vanish. The canopy doors, as well as the full vehicle, can be customized with end-user logos and graphics to enhance the brand experience. Gallery, with 40 years of experience delivering custom food kiosk solutions, has expanded into electric mobile delivery vehicles, as customers increasingly want food, beverages and merchandise delivered to where they are gathering. For example, a recent study conducted by Technomic found that a large majority of students, 77%, desired alternative mobile and to-go food options on campuses.
 
Gallery, a premier distributor of AYRO vehicles, has a diverse clientele throughout mobile food, beverage and merchandise distribution markets for key customer applications such as university, corporate and government campuses, major league and amateur-level stadiums and arenas, resorts, airports and event centers. In addition to finding innovative and safe ways to deliver food and beverages to their patrons, reducing and ultimately eliminating their carbon footprint is a top priority for many of these customers.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to continue to develop and commercialize automotive-grade, sustainable electric transportation solutions for the markets and use cases that we believe can be well served by our purpose-built, street legal low speed electric vehicles. Our business strategy includes the following:

8
-


● | Scale up our operations to achieve growth. We intend to direct resources to scale up our operations, which we believe is needed to increase our revenue, including expanding and optimizing our automotive component supply chain and our flow-based assembly operations in Round Rock, Texas. Further, we plan to expand sales territories and add distribution channels, forming strategic partnerships to build out our whole product offering across multiple segments and to access additional sales channels or to accelerate product adoption for particular vertical markets, building our brand, and increasing manufacturing capacity to produce higher volumes of electric vehicles. Importantly, we are pursuing a strategy to increase our North American content in our vehicle platforms, starting with the AYRO Vanish Fleet. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identify defined markets and use cases which are currently under-served but represent sizable market opportunity sub-sets of the electric vehicle market and focus development efforts on purpose-built electric vehicles to address such markets. We are currently developing a new series of modular, highly reconfigurable payload systems affording operators the maximum flexibility in the use of their fleet for a plurality of payloads. We intend to direct resources to advance the development of such reconfigurable payload solutions which we believe will afford customers the option of sharing transportation assets or configuring those assets differently for differing time of day or time of season use cases. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest in research and development and qualification of sensors, cameras, software and mobility services, seeking to enhance the value of using our electric vehicles and to derive incremental potential revenue streams for us and our partner ecosystem. We intend to offer a web-based application to accompany every vehicle sold or leased beginning with the AYRO Vanish Fleet to enhance the use cases for those vehicles and optimize driver routing, user scheduling, and customer communication. We intend for onboard sensors will collect vehicle health, location data, route data, payload data and environmental data to provide us, the customer and fleet operators the ability to do post-hoc analysis of forecast versus observed delivery efficiency. A subscription service could later be offered even to delivery operators operating vehicles other than ours, creating the potential for an additional revenue stream.

Trends Driving the Need for Electric Vehicles
 
The U.S. electric vehicle market is forecasted to grow substantially in the years ahead, driven by factors such as the country’s increasingly urbanized population, escalating gas prices and increased desirability of non-emissive transportation alternatives.
 
A segment of the electric vehicle market, low speed electric vehicles (“LSEVs”)—which are LSVs but cannot be powered by gas or diesel fuel—are growing increasingly popular as eco-friendly options for consumers and commercial entities. LSEVs run on electric motors fueled by a variety of different batteries, such as lithium ion, molten salt, zinc-air and various nickel-based designs.
 
Trends such as increasingly stringent government regulations aimed toward reducing vehicle emissions, growing urban populations and social pressure to adopt sustainable lifestyles all create a demand for more ecologically and economically sustainable methods of transportation. This demand continues to spur technological advancements and LSEV market growth.
 
Expanding rules and regulations governing vehicle emissions have contributed to growth in the LSEV market. In particular, the U.S., Germany, France, and China have implemented stringent laws and regulations governing vehicular emissions, requiring automobile manufacturers to use advanced technologies to combat high-emission levels in vehicles. To incentivize clean-energy use, many governments are increasingly instituting substantial incentives for consumers to purchase electric vehicles, such as:
 

● | tax credits, rebates, and exemptions; 
--+------------------------------------------
● | reduced utility rates; and 
● | parking incentives. 

 
Further, governments are establishing infrastructure benchmarks to support the growth of the electric vehicle industry.

Competition and Market Opportunities
 
The worldwide automotive market, particularly for economy and alternative fuel vehicles, exhibits a high competitive intensity, especially amongst tier 1 competitors. The relatively modest LSEV market, being smaller in overall size, engenders a more modest competitive intensity. A few notable companies in the global LSEV market include HDK Electric Vehicles, Bradshaw Electric Vehicles, Textron Inc., Polaris Industries, Yamaha Motors Co. Ltd., Ingersoll Rand, Inc., Speedway Electric, AGT Electric Cars, Bintelli Electric Vehicles and Ligier Group.
 
When compared to internal combustion engine vehicle costs, our vehicles are significantly more attractive based on tax, title and license fees. Compared to a standard Ford F150 (gasoline) pickup truck (2.7 liter), the AYRO Vanish Fleet is expected to provide an approximate 49% reduction in operating expenses and an approximate 100% reduction in CO2 emissions (if renewed energy is used to charge the AYRO vehicles, an increasing trend for most higher education campuses and government facilities).
 
Our closest competitor in the LSEV industry is the WAEV, Inc. (formerly Polaris) Gem (“Gem”). WAEV offers multiple passenger vehicle models and multiple utility vehicle models under the WAEV and Taylor-Dunn brands. While the GEM el XD model, which is similar to vehicles in the AYRO 411x Fleet, has a lower starting MSRP than the AYRO 411x, the GEM el XD requires reconfiguration to match the standard AYRO 411x features, raising the final MSRP of each vehicle above that of the AYRO 411x Fleet alternative and above the expected MSRP of the Vanish. The AYRO 411x Fleet has, and the Vanish is expected to have, a greater bed and box capacity, 13% more horsepower and a 48% better turning radius, allowing use of our in tighter spaces than are possible using the GEM el XD.
 
We expect competition in our industry to intensify over time. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in both existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our vehicles or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
 
Factors that are anticipated to boost the demand of LSV markets in North America include: rising elderly population, commuters, students and government fleets seeking mobility solutions beyond automobiles, and projections of lower vehicle mils and greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.
 
Target Markets
 
Our target market segment straddles the range of a converted golf cart to a small pickup truck. This “hybrid” market allows for cannibalization of both adjacent markets by AYRO. The multipurpose applications and clean energy use of LSEVs make them popular across a wide array of industries and customers, including college and university campuses, resorts and hotels, corporate parks, hospitals, warehouses, individual consumers, last mile delivery service providers, municipalities, and the food service industry. A number of these market segments, and our competitive position within them, are discussed in greater detail below.
 
Universities. LSEVs are growing increasingly common on university and college campuses due to a number of factors. LSEVs fulfil the versatile needs of campuses better than golf carts or standard combustion vehicles because not only do LSEVs’ low speed thresholds promote safer driving among pedestrians, but the vehicles are also street legal with on-road safety features, enabling drivers to drive on roads and free up pedestrian space along sidewalks and smaller pathways. Additionally, the significantly reduced carbon imprint of LSEVs compared to internal combustion engine vehicles appeals to environmentally aware students and professors looking to promote environmental sustainability on campus. By transitioning from internal combustion engine vehicles to LSEVs, campuses should be able to reduce significantly the costs spent on fuel, oil, parts, and maintenance. We believe the AYRO Vanish Fleet will provide all of these benefits to university and college campuses. We estimate that in the U.S., there are over 1,800 higher education campuses with over 10,000 students each with over 400 on-campus vehicles that are ideal targets for the AYRO Vanish Fleet as campuses transition from fossil-fueled campus fleet vehicles to LSEVs.
 
Food Delivery Services. As the millennial generation assumes a more substantial portion of the consumer population, customers increasingly favor convenience and timeliness, spurring dramatic growth in online ordering and delivery services across a wide swath of industries, including food delivery and restaurant ordering services. Food delivery sales are anticipated to increase over 20% per year, culminating in an expected $365 billion worldwide by 2030, according to Upserve. Upserve further estimates that approximately 60% of U.S. consumers report that they order delivery or takeout at least once a week. Within the next decade, potentially over 40% of restaurant sales will be attributable to delivery services, according to Morgan Stanley. Every major urban environment having a 35mph or less speed limit is a target market for our current and future LSV fleet.

Last Mile Delivery Service. Retail focus on last mile delivery—the movement of goods from a transportation hub to the final delivery destination—has grown exponentially over the past few years due to the rise in online ordering and e-commerce. Consumers’ ability to pick and choose products based on delivery speed and availability makes last mile delivery a key differentiator among retailers. Last mile delivery provides retailers timelier and more convenient delivery options not offered by the main three shipping services in the U.S. (the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS). Additionally, given the increasing designation of low emission zones in urban centers, retailers will need to continue to deploy eco-friendly vehicles. Retailers will likely expand the use of LSEV fleets to make deliveries in low emission zones due to their zero gas emissions and lower price than competing electric vehicles.
 
Municipalities. As more city governments adopt regulations geared toward reducing pollution from vehicles, cities are increasingly looking to replace their municipal vehicles with zero-emission fleets. Such fleet overhauls, however, can be costly. LSEVs are a cheaper and more practical option for cities daunted by the cost of standard electronic vehicles. Our LSEVs have both on and off-road capabilities, making them particularly versatile for municipalities.
 
On-Road and Personal Transportation. LSEVs offer a feasible and practical method of transportation, especially in urban centers. Because our LSEVs are street-legal, they offer city dwellers a more sustainable, cost-efficient, easily maneuverable, compact and light weight option compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. Our LSEVs also offer a variety of specifications and equipment, meaning that consumers do not have to sacrifice comfort or convenience.
 
We primarily focus on the LSEV North American market, which is highly competitive and constitutes 28% of the global LSEV market according to WiseGuy Reports. We have examined various considerations with regard to our market impact, including cost comparisons to existing vehicles in the market, market validation and target commercial markets.
 
Resources
 
We sourced our semi-knocked-down kits for the model year 2022 AYRO 411 and 411x from Cenntro. While many of their components are commercial off-the-shelf (“COTS”) parts, many are specific to the 411 product and are subject to raw material limitations. However, for AYRO Vanish, we have endeavored to reduce our supply risk by migrating our vehicle supply chain to the North American continent and by embracing parts and sub-assembly standardization, reducing discrete stock keeping units and simplifying logistical complexity.

Intellectual Property
 
As we expand our vehicle and service roadmaps, and integrated technologies, our focus on identifying specific market and customer needs continues to drive purpose-built engineering efforts.
 
Leveraging the all-electric AYRO 411x and Vanish Fleet LSVs, we intend to develop applications or use case solutions optimized for the logistics of storing and delivering food, beverages, merchandise, equipment, tools and related goods. This is accomplished by integrating application-specific appliances, storage facilities, vehicle wraps and related items. We will leverage either integrated traction or a separate battery power system to provide AC power to the various appliances and solution elements. We are filing and have filed a number of provisional utility and/or design patents associated with the aforementioned verticalization development, and we have filed for both domestic and international trademarks to cover the company name, company logo, and certain other key product and service marks. We continue to focus on innovative and applicable electric vehicle optimization designs that serve an expanding customer and application use base.
 
Patents
 
We currently have United States registrations for two design patents. Both were issued on February 11, 2020 and will expire on February 11, 2035. In addition to these issued patents, we have numerous non-public patent applications on file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).
 
We currently have United States applications for two design patents and two utility patents awaiting examination. Reference number 58929.11US01 was filed on March 10, 2022 for Electric Vehicle Structure. Reference number 58929.12US01 was filed on April 12, 2022 for Electric Vehicle Control Systems, Apparatus, and Methods. Reference number 58929.23US01 was filed on May 20, 2022 for Reconfigurable Vehicle Payload Architecture. Reference number 58929.25US01 was filed on June 21, 2022 for Systems and Methods for Residual Tire Track Shaping and Elimination.
 
All patents have been filed under accelerated consideration criteria due to the age (65) of the named inventor.
 
Trademarks
 
We have two granted trademark applications in the United States and abroad. We registered the word “AYRO” as United States Registration No. 88431321 on June 23, 2020. This registration was also filed in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union under the Madrid Protocol as Registration No. 1507096. Our Company logo was registered as United States Registration No. 88859276 on October 13, 2020. This logo was also registered in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union under the Madrid Protocol as Registration No. 1554092. Our application for the color version of our Company logo was filed in the United States on October 9, 2020 as Serial No. 90245135 and is currently in prosecution with the USPTO.
 
Currently, we have eight trademarks pending, including a logo refresh and the AYRO Valet, Vapor, and Vanish trademarks.
 
Government Regulations
 
Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The most significant standards and regulations affecting AYRO are discussed below.

12
--

Mobile Source Emissions Control
 
The federal Clean Air Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that may be lawfully emitted by new vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United States. The current (“Tier 2”) emissions regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) set standards for motorcycles. Tier 2 emissions standards also establish durability requirements for emissions components up to 5 years or 30,000 kilometers.
 
California has received a waiver from the EPA to establish its own unique emissions control standards for certain regulated pollutants. New vehicles and engines sold in California must be certified by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). CARB’s emissions standards for motorcycles are in line with those of the EPA. We currently expect that our vehicles will meet and exceed both the EPA’s and CARB’s standards.
 
Motor Vehicle Safety
 
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, or “Safety Act,” regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). Meeting or exceeding NHTSA safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. If we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Certification
 
Our product programs are built on plug-in electric, zero emissions platforms. We report federal and state emissions data consistent with 10 CFR 474 and CARB requirements for Zero-Emission Vehicle certification.
Electromagnetic Compatibility
 
The Federal Communications Commission is the federal agency responsible for implementing and enforcing communications law and regulations, including Part 15 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations which regulates unlicensed radio-frequency transmissions, both intentional and unintentional. With very few exceptions, all electronic devices must be reviewed to comply with Part 15 before they can be advertised or sold in the U.S. market.
Motor Vehicle Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
 
As with helmet laws and driver’s license requirements, state laws that regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of motor vehicles are a patchwork. For our electric vehicles, outside of our collaboration with a third-party sales/distribution white label partner, we plan on a multi-faceted approach to sales, including exploring the following: (i) developing an expanded network of channel partners; (ii) entering into direct sales via a national leasing company that will in turn consummate sales with end users in a variety of states; and/or (iii) opening facilities in high growth states and delivering the vehicle to the end user via a common carrier. On December 20, 2022, we completed pre-production on our Model Year 2023 refresh vehicle, the AYRO Vanish. The Vanish will share no commonality with the legacy 411 platform and will be the product of a supply chain evolution from Asian suppliers to North America.
 
We are registered as a manufacturer in Texas, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida and Arizona.
 
Pollution Control Costs
 
We are required to comply with stationary source air pollution, water pollution, and hazardous waste control standards that are now in effect or are scheduled to come into effect with respect to our manufacturing operations.
Research and Development
 
Our product development and engineering efforts align with the Society of Automotive Engineering (“SAE”) J2258_201611 standards for Light Utility Vehicles. The J2258 standard provides key compliance criteria for Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (“GVWR”), occupant protection and safety restraint systems, lateral and longitudinal stability, center of gravity and operating controls, among others. Our test validation and inspection standards follow Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) 49 CFR 571.500 for LSVs with the additions of SAE J585 and FMVSS 111 for rear visibility, lighting, signaling, reflectors, changes in direction of movement, back-up camera response timing and field of view.
 
Our development standards and test compliance validation processes are supported by a variety of test documentation, including supplier self-reporting, third party laboratory test reports and regional compliance validation with CARB for speed, range and environmental performance.

Our production system follows a lean, cell-based manufacturing model. The process involves the following five sequential cells: (1) cab preparation, (2) chassis preparation, (3) system integration and testing, (4) final assembly and integration test, and (5) quality assurance and FMVSS Compliance. Assembly quality and shift efficiency metrics are measured daily by our production staff at the end of every shift.
 
We maintain a certification and compliance checklist for each vehicle. Our vehicles use an automotive style steering wheel, turn signal stalk, headlight, running light and reverse light controls, a multi-speed windshield wiper and washer, and an accelerator and brake pedal consistent with controls employed in standard passenger cars.
 
Segment Information
 
We operate as one reportable segment, which is the design, development, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 44 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we maintain good relations with our employees. We have not furloughed employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
