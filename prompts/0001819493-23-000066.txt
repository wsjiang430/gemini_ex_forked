Technology Supporting Our Products & Services 
Xos Vehicles & Powered by Xos™
Our proprietary battery pack systems (the “X-Pack”) and the X-Platform were engineered to be modular. Such modular design for the X-Pack and X-Platform enables fleet operators to upfit our chassis with their preferred vehicle body and tailor battery range to satisfy their specific commercial application (e.g., upfitting with a specific vehicle body and/or tailoring battery range).
X-Pack 
Xos maintains the ability to design and engineer battery systems in house and integrate battery systems from third-party partners. We have developed proprietary battery pack technology purpose-built for last-mile commercial use cases. Our Xos battery packs (“X-Packs”) feature “cut-to-length” modular architecture to provide flexibility and satisfy customers’ preferred range and payload capacity needs. We strive to continuously improve our in-house designs while also utilizing partner battery packs to provide innovative solutions for our customers and improve vehicle TCO. 
 X-Platform 
The X-Platform is the foundation of Xos vehicle products. Our modular proprietary chassis accommodates a wide range of commercial use applications and vehicle body upfits. Such modularity provides us with a competitive advantage in the commercial transportation sector in which commercial fleet operators deploy vehicles across an array of applications and environments.
 Each X-Platform is able to accommodate a sufficient number of X-Packs to provide up to 270 miles of range across our current vehicle product variants. Our vehicle range capability allows Xos vehicles to meet the demands of rigorous last-mile routes. Each X-Platform is constructed with high-strength steel, which is designed to provide enhanced durability relative to other options on the market.

Sales & Marketing 
Direct Sales
Our sales efforts consist of both inside sales representatives and field-based personnel who work to educate fleets on the wide-ranging benefits of our zero-tailpipe emission trucks and efficient methods to transition to electric fleets. 
Dealer Sales
To supplement our direct sales organization we partner with various distributors and dealers with long-established fleet relationships in key markets. Such partnerships add sales expertise and deep industry knowledge, as well as access to hundreds of technicians to support customers with best-in-class parts and service support. 
Energy & Infrastructure
In order to accelerate the adoption of electric trucks across all sectors, Xos has a dedicated sales force with specialized expertise in charging and infrastructure installations to facilitate fleet transition to electric vehicles. Our energy sales representatives are able to assist customers throughout the entire construction process, including managing projects, permitting, and securing available funding when applicable. 
Powered by Xos
With our deep level of battery and powertrain technology, Xos actively pursues opportunities to supply OEM’s with powertrain kits as first-fit solutions to electrify industrial and off-highway equipment such as cranes, forklifts, and related equipment. 
Customers 
In addition to large-scale national accounts with major commercial fleet operators, we deliver vehicles directly to small -and medium-sized fleets via our in-house sales representatives and established distribution and channel partners. Such accounts include independent service providers (ISPs), which fulfill last-mile routes for enterprise partners. We have also entered into robust partnerships with established distributors such as Thompson Truck Centers to facilitate sales to commercial fleets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for 42% of the Company’s revenues. 
Competition 
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from a number of companies, particularly as the commercial transportation sector increasingly shifts towards low-emission, zero-tailpipe emission and carbon neutral solutions. Existing commercial diesel vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner, Ford, General Motors, Navistar, Paccar, and Volvo/Mack, are shifting their focus to developing zero-tailpipe emissions solutions for the customers. 
In addition to competition from traditional diesel OEMs, we face competition from disruptive vehicle manufacturers that are developing alternative fuel and electric commercial vehicles, such as Nikola, Rivian, Workhorse, BYD Motors, Harbinger, Lightning e-Motors, The Lion Electric Company, SEA Electric, Motiv Power Systems, Blue Arc, and Proterra.
We believe the primary competitive factors in the commercial vehicle market for medium- and heavy-duty last-mile and return-to-base segments include, but are not limited to:
•total cost of ownership;
•emissions profile;
•effectiveness within target applications and use cases;
•ease of integration into existing operations;
•product performance and uptime;
•vehicle quality, reliability and safety;
• service and support;
•technological innovation specifically around battery, software and data analytics; and
•fleet management.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors; however, our competitors may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their alternative fuel and electric vehicle programs. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research and development, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
Service & Maintenance 
We continue to grow our service network with added Xos field service technicians, third party service partners, including W.W. Williams and Hwy 7 & 50, and full line dealer partnerships with the addition of Foley Equipment and Ventura Truck Sales (Gabrielli). This growth continues to support our ability to provide customers with comprehensive after-sales services to ensure maximum uptime and minimal operational disruption.
Manufacturing & Supply Chain 
Manufacturing 
We utilize a flexible manufacturing approach that leverages manufacturing partnerships to develop smaller and adaptable facilities relative to the large-scale greenfield manufacturing plants popular amongst traditional automotive manufacturers. Our flex manufacturing approach is structured such that the manufacturing partner provides real property facilities and vehicle assembly services while we coordinate other aspects of the manufacturing process, including supply chain logistics, battery assembly and manufacturing engineering. The smaller footprint of a flex facility and our utilization of existing facilities and labor allows us to establish each flex facility in under one year. We are able to upstart our facilities in lockstep 
with our order book and address market demand in real-time ahead of competitors with longer lead-time manufacturing strategies. Our nimble flex facilities can also be strategically positioned in geographies near customers and suppliers — both domestic and international — and reduce logistics complexity and shipping costs.
Our current flex facility is located in Byrdstown, Tennessee and utilizes the facilities of Fitzgerald Manufacturing Partners, LLC. The flex facility is designed to manufacture up to 5,000 vehicles per year once fully tooled. 
In addition to our flex manufacturing facility in Tennessee, we maintain a battery production line in Los Angeles to produce batteries for specific use cases and research and development. 
Supply Chain 
Our suppliers include CATL (providing battery packs from China), BEL Power (providing power electronics from Europe) and Dana (providing motors & inverters from India and China), among others. As is the case for some automotive companies, certain of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. We work to qualify multiple suppliers for key components where feasible in order to minimize potential production risks. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety inventory for certain key components. Our products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We are currently securing all raw materials and components that are either available or becoming available in the global supply chain to support our operations. 
Governmental Programs, Incentives & Regulations 
Our business is impacted by various government programs, credits, incentives and policies. Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions. Electric vehicle demand has been spurred by government incentives and regulations at federal, state and local levels. Government agencies around the world are expected to continue providing incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles, and regulations may be introduced to reduce emissions and encourage the use of clean energy vehicles.
Governmental regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to ours are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have on our business.
 Programs & Incentives 
EV Tax Credits (Inflation Reduction Act)
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Xos customers may receive up to $40,000 per vehicle in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.
State Vehicle Incentives 
Numerous states, as well as certain private enterprises, offer incentive programs to encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, including tax exemptions, tax credits, exemptions, and special privileges. Most of these programs have eligibility requirements such as a certain fleet size, required diesel truck trade-in, and environmental regulation compliance. For some state rebate and incentive programs, only a finite amount of funding is available. 
Notable for Xos customers is the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”), which provides point-of-sale vouchers for certain qualifying ZEVs. Under HVIP, dealers and fleet operators may request vouchers from HVIP on a first-come first-served basis, up to the funding amount available for that year, to reduce the cost of purchasing hybrid and zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses. Voucher amounts vary depending on a range of factors, such as the type of vehicle, the location where the vehicle is operated, and the number of vehicles sold. To qualify for HVIP, dealers are required to complete extensive training, initiate and complete applications for each sales order, and complete the voucher redemption process upon delivery to the end-user. HVIP represents the most utilized of the subsidy programs due to its ease of access and amount of funding per vehicle.
 Infrastructure Incentives 
 A number of states and municipalities also offer incentive programs to encourage the installation of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. The magnitude of incentives varies based on individual charging capabilities. 
Emissions Credit Programs 
California has greenhouse gas emissions standards that closely follow the standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The registration and sale of zero-emission vehicles (“ZEV”) in California could earn us ZEV credits that we could in turn sell to traditional original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) looking to offset emissions from their traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in order to meet California’s emissions regulations. Other U.S. states have adopted similar standards including Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. We may take advantage of these regimes by registering and selling ZEVs in these other U.S. states.
ZEV credits in California are calculated under the ZEV regulation and are paid in relation to ZEVs sold and registered in California including battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”) and fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEVs”). The ZEV program assigns ZEV credits to each vehicle manufacturer. Vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain ZEV credits equal to a set percentage of non-electric vehicles sold and registered in California. Each vehicle sold and registered in California earns a number of credits based on the drivetrain type and the all-electric range (“AER”) of the vehicle under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule Test Cycle. 
Regulations in the United States 
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, vehicle emissions and the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, state and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses issued to us. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and what we anticipate will be increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial administrative, civil, or even criminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders to cease any violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses.
EPA Emissions and Certificate of Conformity 
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA for vehicles sold in all states, and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) is required for vehicles sold in California. Additionally, certain states, known as “CARB opt-in states” have adopted the California standards that are either already effective or take effect in the next few years. CARB sets more stringent standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California and must obtain a waiver of preemption from the EPA before implementing and enforcing such standards. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by the EPA also recognize the CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles. 
Although our vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions, we are required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards or a CARB Executive Order for vehicles sold in California or any of the other states that have adopted the stricter California standards. We have received our Certificate of Conformity from the EPA and have submitted our documentation for the CARB executive order. We expect to receive approval from CARB in the second half of 2023. 
Vehicle Safety & Testing
Our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”). Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles specifying design, construction, and performance requirements. Xos vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS standards in effect at the date of manufacture. While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S. 
We are also required to comply with other federal laws and regulations administered by NHTSA, as well as Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (“FMCSR”), Federal Highway Administration (“FHA”) requirements, and standards set forth by the EPA. 
Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. 
Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation 
State laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale, and service (including delivery) of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to customers in the state. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles. To sell vehicles to customers in states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state or via our authorized dealer partner in that state. However, certain states permit us, as a manufacturer of motor vehicles, to apply for and receive a dealer license to conduct vehicle sales, provided we meet certain requirements. Once licensed in one of these states, we may sell our vehicles to any consumer in the United States as a matter of interstate commerce. As of the date of this filing, we sell all vehicles using our California dealer license. 
Battery Safety & Testing 
Our battery packs are required to conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck or air. We use lithium-ion cells in the high voltage battery packs in our vehicles. The use, storage, and disposal of our battery packs is regulated under U.S. federal law. Our battery packs conform to such “dangerous goods” shipping standards at a cell level. 
Regulations in Canada 
Our vehicles available for sale in the Canadian market are subject to environmental and safety certifications administered by the appropriate Canadian regulatory authorities, including, but not limited to the Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“CMVSS”), which is administered by Transport Canada. Air quality standards are administered by Environment Canada, which accepts US EPA certification. Unlike the United States, there are no impediments to a manufacturer applying for and receiving a dealer license to perform sales and services, however, we must obtain the necessary provincial licenses to enable sales and services in each location. We have completed the Registration of Imported Vehicles (RIV) process for vehicles originally manufactured for distribution in the U.S. market that are being permanently imported into Canada. We are currently in the process of seeking approval under the Appendix G Pre-Clearance Program.
Seasonality 
Historically, the automotive industry has experienced higher revenue in the spring and summer months. Additionally, we expect volumes of commercial vehicle sales to be less in the winter months as many customers shift focus to executing high-volume holiday deliveries. An estimated 40% of our customers operate in the parcel and delivery segment which has a “peak season” between the Thanksgiving and Christmas season, resulting in preparatory fleet expansions leading into such period followed by declined new vehicle purchases thereafter. Additionally, due to the recent introduction of our 2023 Stepvan, we expect deliveries to be weighted towards the second half of fiscal 2022.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our material intellectual property is important to our business. We rely upon a combination of protections afforded to owners of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks, along with employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unpatented trade secrets in the fields of research, development and engineering are an important aspect of our business by ensuring that our technology remains confidential. We also pursue patent protection when we believe we have developed a patentable invention and the benefits of obtaining a patent outweigh the risks of making the invention public through patent filings.
As of December 31, 2022, we had five awarded U.S. patents. We pursue the registration of our domain names and material trademarks and service marks in the United States. In an effort to protect our brand, as of December 31, 2022, we had 26 pending or approved U.S. trademark applications.
We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new inventions, and we are prepared to file additional patent applications when we determine it would benefit our business to do so.
Facilities
Our headquarters are located in an 85,142 square foot facility in Los Angeles, California, where we design, engineer and develop our vehicles and battery packs. We entered a new lease agreement for the facility with the landlord in August 2021. The new lease commenced on January 1, 2022 and will terminate pursuant to its terms on January 31, 2027, unless amended and/or extended.
We also have a flex facility located in Byrdstown, Tennessee that utilizes the facilities of Fitzgerald Manufacturing Partners, LLC, the largest manufacturer of glider kits in the United States. 
Human Capital
People Strategy and Governance
We firmly believe an integral part of our growth story is through elevating the most important asset we have: our people. By focusing on the fundamentals of our people strategy, leadership, culture and talent, we remain strong, adaptive, innovative, and well-equipped to respond to the ever-changing commercial vehicle landscape. Our Employee Experience Team and Sustainability and Innovation Committee are and will be responsible for our human capital policies and strategies and their collective recommendations to our CEO and key leadership members allow us to proactively manage our human capital and care for our employees in a manner that is consistent with our values.
Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At Xos, we believe that creating an inclusive environment for all our employees is foundational to our success and, more importantly, morally the right thing to do. One of our organizational values is “One team: Be actively inclusive. Embrace diversity. Support and celebrate others.” We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace in which all employees have an opportunity to participate and contribute to the success of our business and are valued for their skills, experience, and unique perspectives.
We administer Employee Resource Groups that represent various dimensions of our employee population, including racial, ethnic, gender, religious, and generational communities, as well as provide training materials to team leaders on inclusive leadership. These groups provide a place for employees of diverse backgrounds to find belonging at Xos in addition to helping all employees learn about experiences that differ from their own.
Talent Attraction, Growth, and Capability Assessment
We leverage best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen and expand our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging, empowerment, and innovation. We also create targeted learning experiences, democratizing learning and career development opportunities across the organization, and empowering employees to design their own career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future.
The extent to which our leaders are equipped to care for, inspire, and empower our people plays a vital role in our strategy. Our set of leadership standards outlines clear expectations for our leaders: that they regularly connect with team members, spend time teaching and coaching, and champion their team’s career development. We are committed to helping our leaders strengthen these capabilities with dedicated learning paths and non-traditional learning opportunities.
Employee Well-Being Initiatives
Our holistic approach to well-being encompasses the financial, social, mental/emotional, physical, and professional needs of our employees. Foundational to our well-being philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees and build capability and support for meeting individual well-being needs and goals. These initiatives include financial seminars, weekly mindfulness sessions, an on-site gym, and healthy food in our kitchens.
We employ programs to understand employee sentiment on their mental and emotional well-being, health & safety, employee experience, culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, leadership and strategic alignment. Weekly check-ins gather pulse scores and employee feedback on those topics. Suggestion boxes and focus groups collect additional information on employee sentiment and needs, and we communicate the resulting actions taken with our employee population.
Our well-being programs are an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations with choices to meet their specific needs.
Employment Data
As of December 31, 2022, we had 272 full-time employees, 25 contractors and 3 interns. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationships with our employees to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
