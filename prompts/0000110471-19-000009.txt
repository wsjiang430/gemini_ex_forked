General
Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (the “Company”) is a leading designer, marketer and licensor of a broad range of quality casual footwear and apparel, performance outdoor and athletic footwear and apparel, kids' footwear, industrial work boots and apparel, and uniform shoes and boots. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor of a Michigan corporation of the same name, originally organized in 1906, which, in turn, was the successor of a footwear business established in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1883. The Company’s products are marketed worldwide in approximately 200 countries and territories through owned operations in the United States ("U.S."), Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in continental Europe and Asia Pacific. In other regions (Latin America, portions of Europe and Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa), the Company relies on a network of third-party distributors, licensees and joint ventures.
Today, the Company sources and markets a broad range of footwear styles, including shoes, boots and sandals under many recognizable brand names, including Bates®, Cat®, Chaco®, Harley-Davidson®, Hush Puppies®, HyTest®, Keds®, Merrell®, Saucony®, Sperry® and Wolverine®. The Company licenses its Stride Rite® brand under a global license arrangement. The Company also markets Merrell® and Wolverine® brand apparel and accessories and licenses some of its brands for use on non-footwear products, including Hush Puppies® apparel, eyewear, watches, socks, handbags and plush toys; Wolverine® eyewear and gloves; Keds® apparel; Saucony® apparel and Sperry® apparel. Cat® is a registered trademark of Caterpillar Inc. and Harley-Davidson® is a registered trademark of H-D U.S.A., LLC. 
The Company’s products generally feature contemporary styling with proprietary technologies designed to provide maximum comfort and performance. The Company believes that its primary competitive advantages are its well-recognized brand names, patented proprietary designs, diverse product offerings and comfort technologies, wide range of distribution channels and diversified manufacturing and sourcing base. The Company combines quality materials and skilled workmanship to produce footwear according to its specifications at both Company-owned and third-party manufacturing facilities. The Company’s products are sold at various price points targeting a wide range of consumers of casual, work, outdoor and athletic footwear and apparel. 
The Company’s portfolio of brands is organized into the following three operating segments, which the Company has determined to be reportable operating segments. During the first quarter of 2018, the Kids footwear business was realigned into the Wolverine Boston Group and the multi-brand consumer-direct component is now reported within the other category. All prior period disclosures have been restated to reflect these new reportable operating segments.

• | Wolverine Outdoor & Lifestyle Group, consisting of Merrell® footwear and apparel, Cat® footwear, Hush Puppies® footwear and apparel and Chaco® footwear;


• | Wolverine Boston Group, consisting of Sperry® footwear and apparel, Saucony® footwear and apparel, Keds® footwear and apparel, and the Kids footwear business, which includes the Stride Rite® licensed business, as well as kids' footwear offerings from Saucony®, Sperry®, Keds®, Merrell® and Hush Puppies®; and

The reportable segments are engaged in designing, manufacturing, sourcing, marketing, licensing and distributing branded footwear, apparel and accessories. Revenue for the reportable operating segments includes revenue from the sale of branded footwear, apparel and accessories to third-party customers; revenue from third-party licensees and distributors; and revenue from the Company’s consumer-direct businesses. 
The Company also reports “Other” and “Corporate” categories. The Other category consists of the Company’s multi-branded consumer-direct retail stores, leather marketing operations and sourcing operations that include third-party commission revenues. The Corporate category consists of unallocated corporate expenses, including restructuring and other related costs, impairment of intangible assets, organizational transformation costs and environmental and other related costs. The Company’s operating segments are determined based on how the Company internally reports and evaluates financial information used to make operating decisions. The operating segment managers all report directly to the chief operating decision maker. The Company’s Global Operations Group is responsible for sourcing, distribution, logistics and customer support. 
For financial information regarding the Company, see the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

7

over cowhide leather. The Company’s waterproof and stain resistant leathers are featured in some of the Company’s footwear lines and also sold to external footwear brands.
Multi-brand Consumer-Direct - The multi-brand consumer-direct division includes retail stores that sell footwear and apparel from the Company's brand portfolio and other brands.
Marketing
The Company’s marketing strategy is to develop brand-specific plans and related promotional materials that foster a consistent message for each of the Company’s core brands across the globe. Each operating segment has dedicated marketing personnel who develop the marketing strategies for specific brands. Marketing campaigns and strategies vary by brand, but are generally designed to target consumers in order to increase awareness of, and affinity for, the Company’s brands. The Company’s advertisements typically emphasize fashion, comfort, quality, durability, functionality and other performance and lifestyle attributes of the Company’s brands and products. Components of brand-specific marketing plans vary and may include print and radio advertising, search engine optimization, social networking sites, event sponsorships, in-store point-of-purchase displays, promotional materials and sales and technical assistance.
In addition to the Company’s internal marketing efforts, each brand provides its third-party licensees and distributors with creative direction, brand images and other materials to convey globally consistent brand messaging, including (i) direction on the categories of footwear and apparel to be promoted; (ii) photography and layouts; (iii) broadcast advertising, including commercials and film footage; (iv) point-of-purchase specifications, blueprints and packaging; (v) sales materials; and (vi) consulting services regarding retail store layout and design. The Company believes its brand names represent a competitive advantage, and the Company, along with its licensees and distributors, make significant marketing investments to promote and enhance the market position of its products and drive brand awareness.
Domestic Sales and Distribution
The Company uses a variety of means to support sales to a variety of domestic distribution channels:

• | The Company uses a dedicated sales force and customer service team, third party sales representatives and point-of-purchase materials to support domestic sales.


• | The Company maintains core in-stock inventories to service department stores, national chains, specialty retailers, catalog retailers, independent retailers, uniform outlets and its own consumer-direct business.


• | The Company uses volume direct programs to ship products to the retail customer and to provide products at competitive prices to service major retail, catalog, mass merchant and government customers.


• | The Company also operates brick and mortar retail stores and eCommerce sites.

A broad distribution base insulates the Company from dependence on any one customer. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Seasonality
The Company experiences moderate fluctuations in sales volume during the year, as reflected in quarterly revenue. The Company expects current seasonal sales patterns to continue in future years. The Company also experiences some fluctuation in its levels of working capital, typically including an increase in net working capital requirements near the end of the first and third fiscal quarters. The Company meets its working capital requirements through internal operating cash flows and, as needed, the Revolving Credit Facility, as discussed in more detail under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7: "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
International Operations and Global Licensing
The Company’s foreign-sourced revenue is generated from a combination of (i) sales of branded footwear and apparel through the Company’s owned operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in continental Europe and Asia-Pacific; (ii) revenue from third-party distributors for certain markets and businesses; (iii) revenue from a network of third-party licensees; and (iv) revenue and income from joint ventures that market the Company’s branded products in certain countries in South America and Mexico. The Company’s international owned operations are located in markets where the Company believes it can gain a strategic advantage by directly controlling the sale of its products into retail accounts. License and distribution arrangements enable the Company to generate sales in other markets without the capital commitment required to maintain related foreign operations, employees, inventories or localized marketing programs. The Company believes that joint ventures will provide it with a more meaningful ownership stake and near-term brand impact in fast-growing markets than its traditional licensee and distributor arrangements.
8

The Company continues to develop its international network of third-party licensees and distributors to market its branded products. The Company assists its licensees in designing products that are appropriate to each foreign market, yet consistent with global brand positioning. Pursuant to license or distribution agreements, third-party licensees and distributors either purchase goods directly from the Company and authorized third-party manufacturers or manufacture branded products themselves, consistent with Company standards. Distributors and licensees are responsible for independently marketing and distributing the Company’s branded products in their respective territories, with product and marketing support from the Company.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
The Company directly controls the majority of the units of footwear and apparel sourced under the Company’s brand names. The Company’s licensees directly control the balance. Substantially all of the units sourced by the Company are procured from numerous third-party manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region. The Company maintains offices in the Asia Pacific region to develop and facilitate sourcing strategies. The Company has established guidelines for each of its third-party manufacturers in order to monitor product quality, labor practices and financial viability. The Company has adopted “Engagement Criteria for Partners and Sources,” a policy that requires the Company’s domestic and foreign manufacturers, licensees and distributors to use ethical business standards, comply with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations, commit to use environmentally safe practices, treat employees fairly with respect to wages, benefits and working conditions and not use child or prison labor. The Company’s third-party sourcing strategy allows the Company to (i) benefit from lower manufacturing costs and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities; (ii) source high quality raw materials from around the world; and (iii) avoid capital expenditures necessary for additional owned factories. The Company believes that its overall global manufacturing strategy provides the flexibility to properly balance the need for timely shipments, high quality products and competitive pricing.
The Company’s principal raw material is quality leather, which it purchases from a select group of domestic and foreign suppliers. The widespread availability of common upper materials and specialty leathers eliminates reliance by the Company on a single supplier.
The Company currently purchases all of the raw pigskins used for its Wolverine Leathers Division from one domestic source, which has been a reliable and consistent supplier to the Company for over 50 years. Alternative sources of raw pigskin are available, but the Company believes these sources offer less advantageous pricing, quality and compatibility with the Company’s processing method. The Company purchases all of its other raw materials and component parts from a variety of sources and does not believe that any of these sources are a dominant supplier.
Trademarks, Licenses and Patents
The Company holds a significant portfolio of registered and common law trademarks that identify its branded products and technologies. The Company’s owned trademarks include Hush Puppies®, Dog Likeness (registered design trademark), Wolverine®, Bates®, Chaco®, Soft Style®, Wolverine Fusion®, DuraShocks®, MultiShox®, Wolverine Compressor®, Wolverine ICS®, Hidden Tracks®, iTechnology™, Bounce®, Comfort Curve®, HyTest®, Merrell®, M Circle Design (registered design trademark), Continuum®, Q Form®, Sperry®, Saucony®, Stride Rite® and Keds®. The Company’s Wolverine Leathers Division markets its pigskin leathers under the trademarks Wolverine Warrior Leather®, Weather Tight® and All Season Weather Leathers™. The Company has footwear marketing and distribution rights under the Cat® and Harley-Davidson® trademarks pursuant to license arrangements with the respective trademark owners. The Cat® license has a term through December 31, 2024 and the Harley-Davidson® license has a term through December 31, 2022. Both licenses are subject to early termination for breach.
The Company believes that consumers identify its products by the Company’s trademarks and that its trademarks are valuable assets. The Company has a policy of registering its primary trademarks and vigorously defending its trademarks against infringement or other threats whenever practicable. The Company also holds many design and utility patents, copyrights and various other proprietary rights. The Company protects its proprietary rights under applicable laws.
Order Backlog
At February 17, 2019, the Company had an order backlog of approximately $971 million, compared to an order backlog of approximately $913 million at February 18, 2018. Substantially all of the backlog relates to orders for products expected to ship in fiscal 2019. Orders in the backlog are subject to cancellation by customers and to changes in planned customer demand or at-once orders. The backlog at any particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, retail conditions, expected customer demand, product availability and the schedule for the manufacture and shipment of products. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be predictive of eventual actual shipments. 
Competition
The Company markets its footwear and apparel lines in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. The Company competes with numerous domestic and international footwear marketers, some of whom are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Product performance and quality, including technological improvements, product identity, competitive pricing and 
9

ability to control costs and the ability to adapt to style changes are all important elements of competition in the footwear and apparel markets served by the Company. The footwear and apparel industries are subject to changes in consumer preferences. The Company strives to maintain its competitive position through promotions designed to increase brand awareness, manufacturing and sourcing efficiencies, and the style, comfort and value of its products. Future sales by the Company will be affected by its continued ability to sell its products at competitive prices and to meet shifts in consumer preferences.
Because of the lack of reliable published statistics, the Company is unable to state with certainty its competitive position in the overall footwear and apparel industries. The non-athletic footwear and apparel markets are highly fragmented and no one company has a dominant market position.
Environmental Matters
The Company uses and generates certain substances and wastes that are regulated or may be deemed hazardous to the environment under certain federal, state and local regulations. The Company works with foreign and domestic federal, state and local agencies from time to time to resolve cleanup issues at various sites and other regulatory issues. Financial information regarding the Company’s environmental remediation activities is found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
Employees
As of December 29, 2018, the Company had approximately 3,700 domestic and foreign production, office and sales employees. The Company presently considers its employee relations to be good.
