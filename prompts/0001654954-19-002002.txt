 BUSINESS.

 
  General
  
 Atrion Corporation and its subsidiaries (”we,” “our,” “us,” “Atrion,” or the “Company”) develop and manufacture products, primarily for medical applications. Our medical products are used in a number of fields including fluid delivery, cardiovascular and ophthalmic applications.
 
 Our fluid delivery products accounted for 46 percent of net revenues for 2018, 44 percent of net revenues for 2017 and 42 percent of net revenues for 2016. We have developed a wide variety of proprietary valves designed to precisely fill, hold and release controlled amounts of fluids or gasses on demand for use in various intubation, intravenous, catheter and other applications in fields such as anesthesia and oncology. We make products that deliver fluids as well as promote infection control in hospital and home healthcare environments.
 
  Our cardiovascular products accounted for 33 percent of net revenues for each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. At the core of our cardiovascular products is the MPS2® Myocardial Protection System, or MPS2, a proprietary technology that is the only system used in open-heart surgery that delivers to the heart essential fluids and medications, mixes critical drugs and controls temperature, pressure and other variables. This system indicates improved outcomes offering an integrated, flexible set of choices during surgery without diluting the blood. We also develop and manufacture other cardiovascular products such as cardiac surgery vacuum relief valves; silicone vessel loops for retracting and occluding vessels in minimally invasive surgical procedures; inflation devices for balloon catheter dilation, stent deployment and fluid dispensing; as well as products used in heart bypass surgery to make a precision opening in the heart for attachment of the bypass vessels.
 
  Our ophthalmic products accounted for 7 percent, 9 percent and 11 percent of our net revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are a leading manufacturer of specialized medical devices that disinfect contact lenses. We also manufacture a proprietary line of balloon catheters used in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children and adults.
 
  Our other medical and non-medical products accounted for 14 percent of our net revenues for each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. One of these product lines consists of instrumentation and associated disposables used to measure the activated clotting time of blood. In addition, we manufacture and sell a line of products designed for safe needle and scalpel blade containment. We are also the leading manufacturer of inflation systems and valves used in marine and aviation safety products. We manufacture components used in inflatable survival products and structures. We also produce one-way and two-way pressure relief valves that protect sensitive electronics and other products during transport in other medical and non-medical applications.

  Marketing and Major Customers
 
 We market components to other equipment manufacturers for incorporation in their products and sell finished devices to physicians, hospitals, clinics and other treatment centers. We sell our products through a sales force which consists of direct sales personnel, independent sales representatives and distributors. Our sales managers also work closely with major customers in designing and developing products to meet customer requirements.
  
 We offer customer service, training and education, and technical support such as field service, spare parts, maintenance and repair for certain of our products. We periodically advertise our products in trade journals, routinely attend and participate in industry trade shows throughout the United States and internationally, and sponsor scientific symposia as a means of disseminating product information. We also have supportive literature on the benefits of our products.
  
  Manufacturing
  
 Our medical and non-medical products are manufactured at facilities in Florida, Alabama and Texas. The facilities in Alabama and Florida both utilize plastic injection molding and specialized assembly as their primary manufacturing processes. Our other manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of standard and custom component parts, including the assembly of electronic components, and the testing of completed products.
  
 We are subject to the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, of the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which requires manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain design testing, quality control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. We devote significant attention to quality assurance. Our quality assurance measures begin with the suppliers which participate in our supplier quality assurance program. These measures continue at the manufacturing level where many components are assembled in a clean room environment designed and maintained to reduce product exposure to particulate matter. Products are tested throughout the manufacturing process for adherence to specifications. Most finished products are then shipped to outside processors for sterilization by radiation or ethylene oxide gas. After sterilization, the products are quarantined and tested before they are shipped to customers.
  
 Skilled workers are required for the manufacturing of our products, and we believe that additional workers with these skills are readily available in the areas where our plants are located.
  
 Our medical device operations are EN ISO13485:2016 certified and are subject to FDA jurisdiction. Our non-medical device operations are ISO9001-2008 certified.
  
  Research and Development
  
 A well-targeted research and development, or R&D, program is an essential part of our activities, and we are currently engaged in a number of R&D projects. The objective of this program is to develop new products in our current product lines, improve current products and develop new product lines. The Company expects to continue additional R&D in 2019 in all these fields.
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
  
 The principal raw materials that we use in our products are resins. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in part, on the availability and pricing of these resins. The resins we use are derived from petroleum and natural gas, and the prices fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in petroleum and natural gas prices, demand and the capacity of the companies that produce these resins to meet market needs. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas could adversely affect the availability and pricing of these resins.

 We contract with various suppliers to provide the component parts necessary to assemble our products. Substantially all of these components are available from a number of different suppliers, although certain components are purchased from single sources that manufacture these components using our tooling. We believe that we have satisfactory alternative sources for single-sourced components, although a sudden disruption in supply from one or more of these suppliers could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished products on time. We own the molds used for production of substantially all our components. Consequently, in the event of supply disruption, we should be able to fabricate our own components or contract with another supplier, albeit after a possible delay in the production process.
  
  Patents and License Agreements
  
 Our commercial success is dependent, in part, on our ability to continue developing patentable products, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing or violating the proprietary rights of third parties. We currently have 530 active patents and patent applications pending on products that are either being sold or are in development. We pay royalties to an outside party for one patent. All of these patents and patents pending relate to products currently being sold by us or to products in evaluation stages. Our patents expire at various times over the next 20 years.
  
 We have developed technical knowledge which, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. However, the proprietary nature of such knowledge may be difficult to protect. We have entered into agreements with key employees prohibiting them from disclosing any of our confidential information or trade secrets. In addition, generally these agreements also provide that inventions or discoveries relating to our business by these individuals will be assigned to us and become our sole property.
  
 The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation, and companies in this industry sometimes use intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is often complex and expensive, and the outcome of this litigation is generally difficult to predict.
  
  Competition
  
 Depending on the product and the nature of the project, we compete on the basis of our ability to provide engineering and design expertise, quality, service, product and price. As such, successful competitors must have technical strength, responsiveness and scale. We believe that our expertise and reputation for quality medical products have allowed us to compete favorably with respect to each such factor and to maintain long-term relationships with our customers.
  
 In many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies in the sale of healthcare products. These markets are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially greater capital resources and larger marketing, R&D staffs and facilities than ours. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralization of purchasing functions. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques, product design or functions, or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.

 We design products for a customer or potential customer prior to entering into long-term development and manufacturing agreements with that customer. Because these products are somewhat limited in number and normally are only a component of the ultimate product sold by our customers, we are dependent on our ability to meet the quality requirements of our customers and must continually be attentive to the need to manufacture such products at competitive prices and in compliance with strict manufacturing standards. Additionally, we are dependent on our customers’ success in the marketing of the ultimate products sold. We also compete in the market for inflation devices used in marine and aviation equipment.
  
 Government Regulation
  
  Products
  
 The manufacture and sale of medical products are subject to comprehensive regulation by numerous United States and foreign regulatory agencies, principally the FDA in the United States. The R&D, manufacturing, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical products in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All manufacturers of medical devices must register with the FDA and list all medical devices manufactured by them. The list must be updated annually. Our medical products subsidiaries and certain of our customers are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such regulations and procedures and our medical products manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA. In order for our products to be marketed in countries outside the United States, regulatory approvals must be obtained, and extensive product and quality system regulations must be complied with, in those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary significantly from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than similar processes in the United States. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we would like for our products to be marketed could prevent our products from being marketed in those countries.
  
 The FDA has traditionally pursued a rigorous enforcement program to ensure that regulated entities comply with the FDCA. A company not in compliance may face a variety of regulatory actions, including warning letters, product detentions, device alerts, mandatory recalls or field corrections, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, injunctive actions or civil penalties and criminal prosecutions of the company or responsible employees, officers and directors.
  
 The FDA promulgates rules, which are available to the public, for the approval of medical devices. The process of obtaining FDA approval for new devices can take several months to several years depending on the type of application required for a particular device. Furthermore, the process of obtaining FDA approval can be expensive and uncertain. Even if granted, FDA approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. FDA enforcement policy strictly regulates the promotion of approved medical devices. Product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing. In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations requiring that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations requiring that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that scientific data substantiates the claims and that our advertising is not false or misleading. Generally, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses outside the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many jurisdictions outside the United States have similar regulations.

 Certain aviation and marine safety products are subject to regulation by the United States Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration and similar organizations in foreign countries which regulate the safety of marine and aviation equipment.
  
  Healthcare Regulations
  
 In the United States, healthcare providers, including hospitals and physicians, that purchase medical products for treatment of their patients generally rely on third-party payors, principally Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to reimburse all or a part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed using these products.
  
 Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. In most markets, there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. Market acceptance of our products in international markets depends, in part, on the availability and level of reimbursement.
  
 Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals is generally based on a fixed amount for a patient based upon that patient’s specific diagnosis. Because of this fixed reimbursement method, hospitals may seek to reduce the costs they incur in treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. Frequently, reimbursement is reduced to reflect the availability of a new procedure or technique, and as a result hospitals are generally willing to implement new cost saving technologies before these downward adjustments take effect. Likewise, because the rate of reimbursement for physicians who perform certain procedures has been and may in the future be reduced, physicians may seek greater cost efficiency in treatment to minimize any negative impact of reduced reimbursement. Third-party payors may challenge the prices charged for medical products and services and may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payor, was experimental or was used for an unapproved application.
  
  In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively known as the “Affordable Care Act”) were enacted. The Affordable Care Act made changes that have had a significant impact on healthcare providers, medical device and pharmaceutical companies and insurers.  To generate revenues to fund the expansion of healthcare coverage, the Affordable Care Act has a number of provisions, including a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale in the United States of certain medical devices by the manufacturer, producer or importer effective after December 31, 2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015 included a two-year moratorium on collection of the medical device tax, beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017.  As part of stopgap spending legislation signed into law by President Trump on January 22, 2018, the imposition of the medical device excise tax was delayed for an additional two years until January 1, 2020. The Affordable Care Act also established  a payment transparency program, sometimes referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that requires medical device and drug manufacturers, including the Company, to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. The program is intended to provide patients with enhanced transparency as to the financial relationships that physicians and teaching hospitals have with medical device and drug manufacturers. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to exercise all authority and discretion available to them under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. There have also been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the Trump Administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through such marketplaces. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduced the Affordable Care Act's shared-responsibility payment to zero, effective January 1, 2019.  Following the enactment of the Tax Act, on December 14, 2018 in a case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, a federal judge ruled that the individual mandate imposed by the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional and inseverable from the other provisions of the Affordable Care Act and, therefore, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid.  Although the Trump Administration and CMS have indicated that this ruling will have no immediate effect, we cannot presently determine how this case, as well as other actions to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act, will affect our business. Even while the impact of that case is unclear, the Trump Administration is likely to continue shaping the law significantly through regulations that may impact the health insurance marketplaces, essential health benefits requirements, and Medicaid/marketplace waivers for state flexibilities. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, we anticipate that state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess healthcare reform, including alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. We cannot predict with certainty what impact the adoption or modification of any such reform measures or market forces may have on our business.

  We are, directly or indirectly, subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
  
 The Federal False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the United States government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the government, has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of medical device and drug manufacturers that included the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the FCA resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward.
  
  Product Liability and Insurance
  
 The design, manufacture and marketing of products of the types we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. A problem with one of our products could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert or advisory notice relating to, the product. We have product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate.
 Advisory Board
  
 Several physicians and other healthcare professionals serve as our clinical advisors. These clinical advisors have assisted in the identification of the market need for some of our products. Members of our management and scientific and technical staff from time to time consult with these clinical advisors to better understand the technical and clinical requirements of current and future products. We anticipate that these clinical advisors will continue to play a role in our development activities.
  
 Certain of the clinical advisors are employed by academic institutions and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory agreements with, other entities that may limit their availability to advise us. The clinical advisors may also serve as consultants to other medical device companies. Our clinical advisors are not expected to devote more than a small portion of their time in providing services to us.
