--------+---------

Overview
 We were originally incorporated in California in January 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in May 1996. We are a company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing innovative and life-changing pharmaceuticals, in diseases with high unmet medical needs, through our novel research and development (R&D) platform, focused on neurological and endocrine related diseases and disorders. Utilizing a portfolio approach to drug discovery, we have multiple small molecule drug candidates at various stages of pharmaceutical development. We develop proprietary pharmaceuticals for our pipeline, as well as collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies on our products and product candidates. 
 On April 11, 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved INGREZZA® (valbenazine) capsules for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia (TD). We market INGREZZA for TD in the United States (U.S.) through our specialty sales force focused primarily on physicians who treat TD patients, including psychiatrists and neurologists. The commercial launch of INGREZZA occurred on May 1, 2017.
 On July 24, 2018, we were notified by AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) that FDA approval was granted for ORILISSA® (elagolix) for the management of moderate to severe endometriosis pain in women. Discovered and developed through Phase II clinical trials by us, ORILISSA, the first FDA-approved oral medication for the management of endometriosis with associated moderate to severe pain in over a decade, began to be marketed by AbbVie in August 2018 as part of a collaboration to develop and commercialize elagolix for women’s health.
 Our clinical development programs include opicapone as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult Parkinson's disease patients, elagolix for uterine fibroids partnered with AbbVie, NBI-74788 for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor and a first-in-class central nervous system (CNS) compound each with potential use in the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders.
 AbbVie initiated Phase III studies of elagolix in patients with uterine fibroids in early 2016. The Phase III program included two replicate, pivotal, six-month efficacy and safety studies followed by a six-month safety and efficacy extension study. AbbVie provided positive topline efficacy data from the Phase III studies in women with uterine fibroids in the first quarter of 2018 and additional data from the six-month safety extension study in the third quarter of 2018. We believe the results from these studies will form the basis for an anticipated new drug application (NDA) submission to the FDA in the middle of 2019 for the approval of elagolix in the treatment of uterine fibroids.

We currently have three major collaborations. Two of these collaborations involve out-licensing of our proprietary technology to pharmaceutical partners. In June 2010, we announced an exclusive worldwide collaboration with AbbVie to develop and commercialize elagolix and all next-generation gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (collectively, GnRH compounds). In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (Mitsubishi Tanabe) for the development and commercialization of INGREZZA for movement disorders in Japan and other select Asian markets. The third collaboration agreement, which was entered into in February 2017, is one in which we in-licensed technology from BIAL – Portela & Ca, S.A. (BIAL) for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, in the U.S. and Canada.
 On January 28, 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with a clinical-stage gene therapy company, Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., or Voyager. The collaboration is focused on the development and commercialization of four programs using Voyager’s proprietary gene therapy platforms. The four programs consist of Voyager’s VY-AADC program for Parkinson’s disease and VY-FXN01 program for Friedreich’s ataxia, as well as rights to two programs to be determined by the parties in the future. The effectiveness of the agreement is subject to certain conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions. Refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the agreement.

 INGREZZA (valbenazine) – VMAT2 Inhibitor
 VMAT2 is a protein concentrated in the human brain that is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. VMAT2 is primarily responsible for packaging and transporting monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine) in neurons. Specifically, dopamine enables neurotransmission among nerve cells that are involved in voluntary and involuntary motor control. Disease states such as TD, Tourette syndrome, Huntington’s chorea, schizophrenia, and tardive dystonia are characterized in part by a hyperdopaminergic state in the brain, and modulation of neuronal dopamine levels may provide symptomatic benefits for patients with these conditions, among others.
 INGREZZA as a Treatment for TD. TD is defined by hyperkinetic involuntary movements which arise after months or years of treatment with dopamine receptor blocking agents, e.g. antipsychotics used for treating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, and Reglan® (metoclopramide) for nausea and vomiting and gastric emptying in patients with gastroparesis. Features of

TD may include grimacing, tongue protrusion, lip smacking, puckering and pursing of the lips, and rapid eye blinking. Rapid movements of the extremities may also occur. The impact on daily function and the quality of life for individuals suffering from TD can be substantial. While the prevalence rates of TD can vary greatly in accordance with the population being studied, it is estimated that approximately 500,000 individuals are affected by TD in the U.S. alone (Kantar Health).
 On April 11, 2017, INGREZZA became the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of TD. INGREZZA provides a once-daily dosing treatment option for TD causing reversible reduction of dopamine release at the nerve terminal by selectively inhibiting the pre-synaptic VMAT2. In vitro, INGREZZA is a highly selective inhibitor of human VMAT2 showing little or no affinity for VMAT1, other receptors, such as dopamine D2 receptors, other transporters or ion channels. INGREZZA for TD has two dosing options (40 mg and 80 mg) with 40 mg taken for the first seven days of treatment with an option of 40 mg or 80 mg thereafter depending on a patient’s dosing needs. INGREZZA was generally well tolerated during our clinical trials with no apparent drug-drug interactions with the most common emergent adverse event being mild and transient somnolence.
 In connection with the FDA approval of INGREZZA for TD, we committed to conduct certain post-marketing studies including Phase 1 (e.g., pharmacokinetics in volunteers with renal impairment) and Phase 4 (e.g., randomized placebo-controlled withdrawal in TD patients) studies. We expect to conduct these studies over the next four years.
 Valbenazine as a Treatment for Tourette Syndrome. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated T-Force GOLD, a Phase IIb study of valbenazine in pediatric patients with Tourette syndrome, a neurological disorder that consists of rapid, non-rhythmic stereotyped motor and vocal tics. T-Force GOLD was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy, with optimized dosing of once-daily valbenazine in approximately 120 pediatric patients with moderate to severe Tourette syndrome over 12 weeks of treatment. In the second quarter of 2018, we started T-Force PLATINUM, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of valbenazine in pediatric patients with Tourette syndrome. This study is designed to evaluate longer term efficacy and safety in patients who initial responded to open-label therapy with optimized doses of valbenazine. On December 12, 2018, we announced that topline data from the T-Force GOLD study failed to meet the primary endpoint as assessed by the placebo adjusted change from baseline in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale assessed at week 12. We continue to analyze the complete dataset from the study to determine the next steps for valbenazine in Tourette syndrome.
 elagolix – GnRH Antagonist
 GnRH is the endogenous peptide that binds to the GnRH receptor and stimulates the secretion of the pituitary hormones that are responsible for sex steroid production and normal reproductive function. Researchers have found that chronic administration of GnRH agonists, after initial stimulation, reversibly shuts down this transmitter pathway and is clinically useful in treating hormone-dependent diseases such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Several companies have developed peptide GnRH agonists on this principle, such as Lupron® and Zoladex®. However, since these molecules are peptides, they must be injected via a depot formulation rather than the preferred oral route of administration. In addition, GnRH agonists can take up to several weeks to exert their desired effect once the initial stimulation has occurred, a factor not seen with the use of GnRH antagonists. Upon administration, GnRH agonists have shown a tendency to exacerbate the condition via a hormonal flare. More importantly the profound suppression effect observed with GnRH agonists is similar to that seen after menopause and can be associated with hot flushes and the loss of bone mineral density.
 Orally active, nonpeptide GnRH antagonists potentially offer several advantages over injectable GnRH peptide drugs, including rapid onset of hormone suppression without hormonal flare. Also, injection site reactions commonly observed in peptide depots are avoided and dosing can be rapidly discontinued if necessary – a clinical management option not available with long-acting depot injections. Additionally, by using GnRH antagonists, it may be possible to alter the level of pituitary GnRH suppression thereby titrating circulating hormone levels.
 In June 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration with AbbVie to develop and commercialize GnRH compounds for women’s and men’s health indications. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie is responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs and has responsibility for all regulatory interactions with the FDA related to elagolix and other GnRH compounds covered by the collaboration. Following our entry into the collaboration, AbbVie undertook the development of elagolix in uterine fibroids.
 Endometriosis. Endometriosis is associated with a multitude of symptoms, some of the most common of which include pain related both to menstruation (dysmenorrhea) and sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) as well as chronic pelvic pain throughout the menstrual cycle, infertility, and menorrhagia, among many others. The wide range of symptoms associated with endometriosis serves to complicate and delay diagnosis due to the significant overlap of symptoms with the disease profiles of other conditions. The World Endometriosis Research Foundation estimates that there are over 170 million women worldwide who suffer from endometriosis, including approximately 7.5 million women in the U.S. alone. We believe that the availability of an oral treatment, lacking the side effect profile of the currently available peptide GnRH agonists, may be a desirable alternative to current pharmaceutical therapies and ultimately encourage a significantly higher treatment rate.
 5

During the third quarter of 2017, AbbVie submitted an NDA for elagolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA. The NDA was accepted for priority review by the FDA. In July and October 2018, respectively, AbbVie announced FDA and Health Canada approval for ORILISSA, for the management of endometriosis with associated moderate to severe pain in women. AbbVie began commercialization of ORILISSA in the U.S. in August 2018.
 Uterine Fibroids. Uterine fibroids are benign hormonally responsive tumors that form in the wall of the uterus. They are the most common solid tumor in women with a prevalence rate of at least 25% (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). While many women do not have symptoms, depending on the size, location and number, uterine fibroids can cause symptoms such as: longer, more frequent, or heavy menstrual bleeding, menstrual pain, vaginal bleeding at time other than menstruation, pain in the abdomen or lower back, pain during sex, difficulty urinating, frequent urination, constipation or rectal pain. Due to the severity of symptoms, treatment sometimes requires surgery, including the removal of the uterus. In fact, uterine fibroids is a leading indication for hysterectomy in the U.S., with approximately 250,000 hysterectomies performed each year related to uterine fibroids (Whiteman et al AJOG 2008, 198, e1). We believe that a safe and effective oral therapy would be a preferred treatment regimen rather than surgical intervention.
 AbbVie initiated Phase III studies of elagolix in patients with uterine fibroids in early 2016. The Phase III program included two replicate, pivotal, six-month efficacy and safety studies followed by a six-month safety and efficacy extension study. AbbVie evaluated 300mg of elagolix dosed twice daily both alone and in combination with hormonal add-back therapy (estradiol/norethindrone acetate). The primary endpoint in these Phase III studies was the same as that employed in the Phase IIb study: percent of subjects with reduction in uterine blood flow as measured by the alkaline hematin method.
 AbbVie provided positive top-line efficacy data from the two Phase III studies in women with uterine fibroids in the first quarter of 2018 and additional data from the six-month safety extension study in the third quarter of 2018. The ELARIS UF-I and UF-II studies of elagolix met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at month six. These replicate Phase III studies were randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating elagolix alone or in combination with low-dose hormone (add-back) therapy in women with heavy uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. The studies enrolled approximately 400 patients each for an initial six-month placebo-controlled dosing period. At the end of the six months of placebo-controlled evaluation, patients were eligible to enter an additional six-month safety extension study. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was an assessment of the change in menstrual blood loss utilizing the alkaline hematin method comparing baseline to month six. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated including the change in fibroid volume and hemoglobin. Bone mineral density was assessed via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan at baseline, at the conclusion of dosing, and at six months post-dosing. We believe the results from these studies will form the basis for an anticipated NDA submission to the FDA in the middle of 2019 for the approval of elagolix in the treatment of uterine fibroids.
 opicapone – Catechol-O-methyltransferase Inhibitor
 Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are utilized to prolong the duration of effect of levodopa, the primary treatment option for Parkinson’s disease patients. Administration of levodopa often results in adequate control of Parkinson’s symptoms, also referred to as “on-time,” however, there are periods of the day where the effects of levodopa wear off and motor symptoms worsen. These periods are considered “off-time.” Opicapone is a novel, once-daily, peripherally-acting, highly-selective COMT inhibitor utilized as adjunct therapy to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing motor fluctuations. Opicapone works through decreasing the conversion rate of levodopa into 3-O-methyldopa, thereby reducing the off-time period in patients with Parkinson’s and extending the on-time period.
 In February 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, in the U.S. and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for the development and commercialization of opicapone in the U.S. and Canada.
 Parkinson’s Disease. Parkinson’s disease is a chronic and progressive movement disorder that affects approximately 1 million people in the United States. The disease is characterized by a loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, the area of the brain where dopamine is produced. Dopamine production and synthesis is necessary for coordination and movement. As Parkinson’s progresses, dopamine production steadily decreases resulting in tremor, slowed movement (bradykinesia), impaired posture and balance, and speech and writing problems. There is no present cure for Parkinson’s and management consists of controlling the motor symptoms primarily through administration of levodopa therapies. While this improves the control of Parkinson’s symptoms, as the disease progresses the beneficial effects of levodopa begin to wear off, symptoms worsen, and patients experience motor fluctuations. These motor fluctuations are improved with the addition of a COMT inhibitor to levodopa.
 In June 2016, the European Medicines Agency authorized ONGENTYS® (opicapone) as an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilized on those combinations. This approval was based on data from a clinical development program that included 28 clinical studies of more than 900 patients treated with opicapone in 30 countries worldwide.
 6

The two pivotal Phase III studies utilized for approval with the European Medicines Agency, BIPARK-I and BIPARK-II, demonstrated that opicapone once-daily achieved a statistically significant decrease in off-time periods for Parkinson’s patients compared to placebo. The BIPARK-I study was a placebo-controlled study of approximately 600 patients that also included entacapone as an active comparator. The results of this study also showed that once-daily opicapone was non-inferior to entacapone which is dosed multiple times per day. The BIPARK-II study was a placebo-controlled study of approximately 400 patients that also showed a significant decrease in off-time periods for Parkinson’s patients. In both studies, opicapone was associated with significant improvements in both patient and clinician global assessments of change. The data from these two Phase III trials also demonstrated that opicapone improved motor fluctuations in levodopa-treated patients regardless of concomitant dopamine agonist or monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors used. Opicapone was generally well tolerated and was not associated with relevant electrocardiographic or hepatic adverse events.
 Both of the BIPARK Phase III trials included a one-year open-label extension where opicapone sustained the decrease in off-time and increase in on-time periods that was demonstrated during the double-blind placebo-controlled portion of the studies.
 We held a meeting with the FDA in January 2018 to discuss a potential NDA submission for opicapone. Based upon the BIPARK-I and BIPARK-II pivotal Phase III studies conducted by BIAL, the FDA did not require additional Phase III trials in connection with an NDA submission for opicapone. We anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for opicapone in the second quarter of 2019.
 NBI-74788 – Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor1 Antagonist
 Corticotropin-releasing factor1 (CRF1) is a hypothalamic hormone released directly into the hypophyseal portal vasculature which acts on the CRF1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), in the anterior pituitary to stimulate the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). The primary role of ACTH is the stimulation of the synthesis and release of adrenal steroids including cortisol. Cortisol from the adrenals have a negative feedback role at the level of the hypothalamus that decreases CRF1 release as well as at the level of the pituitary to inhibit the release of ACTH. This tight control loop is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Blockade of CRF1 receptors at the pituitary has been shown to decrease the release of ACTH and subsequently attenuate the production and release of adrenal steroids.
 Classic CAH. Classic CAH is a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders that affects approximately 20,000-30,000 people in the U.S. and results in an enzyme deficiency altering the production of adrenal steroids. Because of this deficiency, the adrenal glands have little to no cortisol biosynthesis resulting in a potentially life-threatening condition. If left untreated, classic CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and eventually death. Even with cortisol replacement, persistent elevation of ACTH from the pituitary gland results in excessive androgen levels leading to virilization of females including precocious puberty, menstrual irregularity, short stature, hirsutism, acne and fertility problems.
 Corticosteroids are the current standard of care for classic CAH and are used chronically to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency and to reduce the excessive ACTH levels and androgen excess. However, the dose and duration of steroid use required to suppress ACTH is well above the normal physiological level of cortisol; resulting in metabolic syndrome, bone loss, growth impairment, and Cushing’s syndrome as common and serious side effects.
 NBI-74788 is a potent, selective, orally-active, CRF1 receptor antagonist as demonstrated in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays. Blockade of CRF1 receptors at the pituitary has been shown to decrease the release of ACTH, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal steroids including androgens, and potentially the symptoms associated with classic CAH. Lower ACTH levels would also reduce the amount of exogenous corticosteroid necessary for classic CAH patients to thrive avoiding the side-effects currently associated with excessive steroid therapy.
 We conducted a Phase I single ascending dose study of NBI-74788 in healthy volunteers in 2017. Based on the positive results of this Phase I study, we initiated a Phase II clinical trial of NBI-74788 in adult patients with classic CAH. This clinical study is designed to be an open-label, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study assessing two ascending dose levels of 14 days dosing of NBI-74788 in up to 20 study participants. Key pharmacodynamic biomarker measurements include ACTH, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androgen, and cortisol levels collected the morning following bedtime dosing on Day 1 and Day 14. We recently expanded this study to include up to 10 additional patients to further optimize dosing flexibility and convenience. Initial results from this study are expected in the first quarter of 2019.
 We intend to apply for orphan drug designation for NBI-74788 in the treatment of classic CAH. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA to medicines intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. and provides sponsors with development and commercial incentives for such designated compounds and medicines.

New VMAT2 Inhibitor
 We have filed an investigational new drug application (IND) and completed dosing in the single ascending dose portion of a Phase I study designed to assess initial safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a novel, internally discovered VMAT2 inhibitor. This compound has the potential to be used in the treatment of several neurology and/or psychiatry disorders. The multiple dosing portion of this Phase 1 study is ongoing and expected to be completed during the first half of 2019.
New CNS Compound
 We have filed an IND and completed dosing in a Phase I single ascending dose study for an internally discovered first-in-class CNS compound with potential use in the treatment of several neurology and/or psychiatry disorders. This study is a randomized, double-blind, single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of the compound in healthy participants. We are currently analyzing the data from this study to inform the design of future clinical studies for the program.
Research Programs
 Our R&D focus is on addressing diseases and disorders of the central nervous and endocrine systems, which include therapeutic categories ranging from hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal disorders to stress-related disorders and neurological/neuropsychiatric diseases. CNS and endocrinology drug therapies are among the largest therapeutic categories, accounting for over $110 billion in drug sales in the U.S. alone according to IQVIA (2018).
CNS and Neuroendocrine Disorders (Targeted by GPCRs, Solute Carrier Proteins, and Ion Channels)
 GPCRs are the largest known gene superfamily of the human genome. Greater than 30% of all marketed prescription drugs act on GPCRs; which makes this class of proteins historically the most successful therapeutic target family. However, only a small fraction of the GPCR gene superfamily has been exploited. Ion channels appear to be represented by approximately 400 genes in the human genome and are currently the targets for approximately 7% of the current marketed drugs. We believe that next-generation therapies derived from targeting GPCRs and ion channels will be discovered through the understanding of the complex relationships of drug/receptor interactions and their subsequent impact on efficacy, downstream signaling networks and regulation.
 Our GPCR research platform has met this requirement by integrating drug discovery research efforts with a suite of assays and assay systems and automated analytical techniques. This process, now also applied to solute carrier proteins and ion channels, provides an unbiased profile of pharmacological protein/ligand interactions coupled with in vivo efficacy using discrete animal models allowing for rapid discovery of initial leads and advancement into preclinical and clinical development. Importantly, this design cycle is not limited to GPCRs, solute carrier proteins, or ion channel targets, but can be utilized for other recently identified proteins that play a role in human disease where current treatments or therapies are either inadequate or nonexistent.
Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on neurological and endocrine-related diseases and disorders. The following are the key elements of our business strategy:
 Maintaining Certain Commercial Rights to Our Product Portfolio to Evolve into a Fully-Integrated Pharmaceutical Company. In April 2017, we received approval from the FDA for INGREZZA for the treatment of TD. We market INGREZZA for TD in the U.S. The commercial launch of INGREZZA occurred on May 1, 2017. We have built a specialty sales force in the U.S. of approximately 250 experienced sales professionals. This specialty sales force focuses on promotion to physicians who treat TD patients, primarily neurologists and psychiatrists. Our commercial team is comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, market research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, medical affairs, quality control, and compliance. We intend to retain commercial rights to certain products, including INGREZZA, that we can effectively and efficiently develop, secure regulatory approval and commercialize, which includes products with a concentrated prescriber base and well-defined patient population that can be accessed with an efficient patient and prescriber outreach program.
 Advancing Life-Changing Discoveries in Neurology, Neuro-Endocrinology, and Psychiatry. We believe that by continuing to advance and extend our product pipeline, we can mitigate some of the clinical development risks associated with drug development. We currently have multiple programs in various stages of research and development. Our two lead late-stage clinical programs are elagolix, a GnRH antagonist in Phase III development for uterine fibroids that is partnered with AbbVie, and opicapone, a highly-selective COMT inhibitor that is an adjunct therapy to preparations of levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors for adult patients with Parkinson’s disease and was in-licensed from BIAL. In addition, we are conducting a Phase II study of NBI-74788 in adult patients with classic CAH, a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders. We take a portfolio approach to managing our pipeline that balances the size of the market opportunities with clear and defined clinical and regulatory paths to approval. By doing so, we focus our internal development resources on innovative therapies with improved probabilities of technical and commercial success.

Selectively Establishing Corporate Collaborations with Global Pharmaceutical Companies to Assist in the Development of Our Products and Mitigate Financial Risk while Retaining Significant Commercial Upside. We leverage the development, regulatory, and commercialization expertise of our corporate collaborators to accelerate the development of certain of our product candidates, while typically retaining co-promotional rights, and at times commercial rights, in North America. For example, we have collaborated with AbbVie for the development and commercialization of ORILISSA, which has received FDA and Health Canada approval for the management of endometriosis, and with respect to our collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (Mitsubishi Tanabe) for the development and commercialization of INGREZZA for movement disorders in Japan and other select Asian markets. We intend to further leverage our resources by selectively entering into additional strategic alliances to enhance our internal development and commercialization capabilities by licensing our technology.
 Identifying Novel Drugs to Address Unmet Market Opportunities. We seek to identify and validate novel drugs on characterized targets for internal development or collaboration. For example, in 2018, we initiated Phase I studies for a new VMAT2 inhibitor and a new CNS compound. In 2017, based on the positive results of a Phase I study we conducted of NBI-74788 in healthy volunteers, we initiated a Phase II study of NBI-74788 in adult patients with classic CAH. We believe the creativity and productivity of our discovery research group will continue to be a critical component for our continued success.
 Acquiring Rights to Complementary Drug Candidates and Technologies. We plan to continue to selectively acquire rights to products in various stages of development to take advantage of our drug development capabilities. For example, in October 2018, we entered into a research collaboration with Jnana Therapeutics, Inc. aimed at discovering novel small molecule therapeutics for multiple targets for CNS disorders. Under the terms of the agreement, we will work jointly to identify novel compounds, after which time we will be responsible for further lead optimization, and the development and commercialization of any potential therapies arising from the collaboration. In February 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, in the U.S. and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for the development and commercialization of opicapone in the U.S. and Canada.
Our Corporate Collaborations and Strategic Alliances
 One of our business strategies is to utilize strategic alliances to enhance our development and commercialization capabilities. The following is a summary of our significant collaborations/alliances:
 AbbVie. In June 2010, we announced an exclusive worldwide collaboration with AbbVie to develop and commercialize GnRH Compounds for women’s and men’s health. AbbVie made an upfront payment of $75 million and has agreed to make additional development and regulatory event-based payments of up to $480 million and up to an additional $50 million in commercial event-based payments. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie is responsible for all development, marketing and commercialization costs. We received funding for certain internal collaboration expenses which included reimbursement from AbbVie for internal and external expenses related to the GnRH Compounds and personnel funding through the end of 2012. We are entitled to a percentage of worldwide sales of GnRH Compounds for the longer of ten years or the life of the related patent rights. AbbVie may terminate the collaboration at its discretion upon 180 days written notice to us. In such event, we would be entitled to specified payments for ongoing clinical development and related activities and all GnRH Compound product rights would revert to us. Since the inception of the agreement, we have recorded revenues of $75 million related to the amortization of up-front license fees, $115 million in milestone revenue, $37 million in sponsored development revenue, and approximately $1.6 million in sales-based royalty revenue on AbbVie net sales of ORILISSA.
 Mitsubishi Tanabe. In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe for the development and commercialization of INGREZZA for movement disorders in Japan and other select Asian markets. Mitsubishi Tanabe made an up-front license fee payment of $30 million and has agreed to make additional development and commercialization event-based payments totaling up to $85 million, payments for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, and royalties on product sales in select territories in Asia. Under the terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi Tanabe is responsible for all development, marketing, and commercialization costs in Japan and other select Asian markets, with the exception of a single Huntington’s chorea trial to be performed by us, at an estimated cost of approximately $12 million, should Mitsubishi Tanabe request the clinical trial. We will be entitled to a percentage of sales of INGREZZA in Japan and other select Asian markets for the longer of ten years or the life of the related patent rights. Mitsubishi Tanabe may terminate the agreement at its discretion upon 180 days written notice to us. In such event, all INGREZZA product rights for Japan and other select Asian markets would revert to us. Since the inception of the agreement, we have recorded revenues of $19.8 million related to the up-front license fee, and $15 million in milestone revenue.
 BIAL. In February 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, in the U.S. and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for the management and cost of all opicapone development and commercialization activities in the U.S. and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid BIAL an upfront license fee of $30 million. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, the FDA provided guidance on the regulatory path forward to support an NDA for opicapone for Parkinson’s disease, in which the FDA did not request that we conduct an additional Phase III study in connection with the submission of an NDA to the FDA, resulting in a $10 million event-based milestone payment to BIAL. We may also be required to pay up to an additional $105 million in milestone payments associated with the regulatory approval and net sales of products containing opicapone. In addition, we will pay BIAL a percentage of net sales (with a floor minimum) in exchange for the manufacture and supply of

opicapone drug product. Either party may terminate the agreement earlier if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified notice period, or upon the other party’s insolvency. BIAL may terminate the agreement if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts or fail to file an NDA for a licensed product by a specified date or under certain circumstances involving a change of control.
 Intellectual Property
 We seek to protect our lead compounds, compound libraries, expressed proteins, synthetic organic processes, formulations, assays, cloned targets, screening technology and other technologies by filing, or by causing to be filed on our behalf, patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. Additionally, we have licensed from institutions the rights to issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications, and issued and pending foreign filings. We face the risk that one or more of the above patent applications may be denied. We also face the risk that issued patents that we own, or license, may be challenged or circumvented or may otherwise not provide protection for any commercially viable products we develop.
 The technologies we use in our research, as well as the drug targets we select, may infringe the patents or violate the proprietary rights of third parties. If this occurs, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue with the commercialization of our products.
 In addition to the granted and potential patent protection, the U.S., the European Union (EU), and Japan all provide data and marketing exclusivity for new medicinal compounds. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the original applicant’s data as the basis of a generic marketing application during the period of data and marketing exclusivity. This period of exclusivity is generally five years in the U.S., six years in Japan and ten years in the EU, measured from the date of FDA, or corresponding foreign regulatory authority, approval.
 INGREZZA, our highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor is covered by U.S. Patent No. 8,039,627, which expires in 2029 (not including a potential patent term extension of up to two years) and U.S. Patent No. 8,357,697, which expires in 2027.
 Elagolix, our small molecule GnRH antagonist currently in clinical trials for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids, is covered by six issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,872,728, 7,179,815 and 7,462,625 are due to expire in 2021 (not including potential patent term extensions of up to five years) while U.S. Patent Nos. 7,056,927, 7,176,211 and 7,419,983 are due to expire in 2024 (not including potential patent term extensions of up to five years).
 Opicapone, a highly selective COMT inhibitor for Parkinson’s disease is covered by U.S. Patent No. 8,168,793, among others, which expires in 2029 (not including a potential patent term extension of up to five years).
 Manufacturing and Distribution
 We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, contract manufacturers to produce INGREZZA, as well as for our existing and future product candidates. We believe this outsourcing manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to our commercialization efforts without devoting the resources and capital required to build manufacturing facilities. 
 We have established an internal pharmaceutical development group to develop manufacturing methods for our product candidates, to optimize manufacturing processes, and to select and transfer these manufacturing technologies to our suppliers. We have also established an internal commercial supply team to manage all aspects related to the INGREZZA commercial supply chain. We have entered into long-term contracts with multiple manufacturers to ensure adequate product supply and to mitigate risk, and we expect to continue to expand and diversify our third-party manufacturing relationships during 2019.
 There currently are a limited number of these manufacturers. Furthermore, some of the contract manufacturers that we have identified to date only have limited experience at manufacturing, formulating, analyzing and packaging our products and product candidates in quantities sufficient for conducting clinical trials or for commercialization. We attempt to acquire adequate inventory of materials and/or finished product to avoid significant supply disruption. 
 Additionally, we have retained third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the distribution of INGREZZA, including shipping, warehousing, customer service, order-taking and processing, invoicing, collections, and other distribution-related activities. 
 We have entered into distribution agreements for INGREZZA with a limited number of specialty pharmacies (SPs) and a specialty distributor (SD) (collectively, customers), and all of our product sales are to these customers. SPs subsequently dispense INGREZZA to patients based on the fulfillment of a prescription and the SD sells INGREZZA primarily to closed-door pharmacies and government facilities. Our agreements with SPs and the SD provide for transfer of title to the product at the time the product is delivered to the SPs or SD. Our three largest customers represented approximately 93% of our product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

INGREZZA Manufacturers
 We entered into a commercial supply agreement with Fabbrica Italiana Sintetici S.p.A. (F.I.S.) in March 2017, for F.I.S.’s manufacture of commercial supplies of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for INGREZZA at F.I.S.’s manufacturing site in Italy. Under the terms of the agreement, F.I.S. is responsible for manufacturing the INGREZZA API, conducting quality control, quality assurance, validation activities, stability testing, packaging, and other services related to the manufacture of the INGREZZA API. In the second quarter of 2018, we received our first order of INGREZZA API under this agreement.
 The agreement requires two years’ notice prior to a termination without cause, provided that no such notice may be given prior to March 2022.
 We entered into a master manufacturing services agreement with Patheon UK Limited (Patheon) in November 2016, and two associated product agreements in 2017 and 2018, for Patheon’s manufacture of commercial supplies of INGREZZA at its manufacturing sites. Under the terms of the agreements, we are responsible for supplying the API for INGREZZA to Patheon. Patheon is responsible for manufacturing the INGREZZA capsules, conducting quality control, quality assurance, validation activities, stability testing, packaging and providing related services for the manufacture of the INGREZZA capsules.
 Pursuant to the agreements, we have agreed to order from Patheon certain annual binding minimum amounts of INGREZZA capsules based on an agreed upon pricing schedule. The agreements have an initial term ending in December 2021 and will automatically renew after the initial term for successive terms of two years, unless either party gives notice of its intention to terminate the agreements within at least 18 months prior to the end of the then current term.
 Commercial Packaging Agreements
 We entered into two commercial packaging agreements with third-party vendors that provide, among other things, services related to the packaging of INGREZZA, tooling purchases and repairs, analytical work, auditing of suppliers, and storage. One such vendor is located in Illinois and the other is located in Pennsylvania. We do not believe that these commercial packaging related agreements are material because our business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement.
Marketing and Sales
 During 2017, we built a specialty sales force in the U.S of experienced sales professionals. This specialty sales force focuses on educating physicians who treat TD patients, primarily neurologists and psychiatrists. Our commercial team is comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, market research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. During 2018, we expanded our sales force by approximately 50% to approximately 250 experienced sales professionals to enhance our ability to develop the TD market. In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, medical affairs, quality control, and compliance.
Government Regulation
 Our business activities, which include the manufacture and marketing of INGREZZA as well as our other potential products currently in research and development, are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. and other countries. Regulation by government authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. All of our products in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In the U.S., various federal and state statutes and regulation also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, and record-keeping of human therapeutic products and their marketing. Recent federal legislation imposes additional obligations on pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding product tracking and tracing.
 In addition, federal and state healthcare laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, federal and state fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. We have a comprehensive compliance program to ensure our business practices remain compliant.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.
 11

Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and the federal civil monetary penalties law, which prohibit among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, requires certain types of individuals and entities to abide by standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
 Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Development and Marketing Approval for Products
 Preclinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an IND application before clinical trials can begin in humans. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three-phase process.

Phase I | Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetic properties of the product in human volunteers. It is rare to evidence pharmacology in these early studies.
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase II | Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety.
---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase III | Large-scale, multi-center, comparative clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine safety and efficacy as primary support for regulatory approval by the FDA to market a product candidate for a specific disease.
----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the U.S. and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Institutional Review Boards, Institutional Ethics Committees, and Data Safety Monitoring Boards may also place holds on our clinical trials or recommend that we voluntarily do so. To date, we have also conducted some of our clinical trials in Europe, Canada, Oceania, and South Africa. Clinical trials conducted in foreign countries are also subject to oversight by regulatory authorities in those countries.
 Once Phase III trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of an NDA or a biologics license application for approval to commence commercial sales. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently 
 12

in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 We will also have to complete an approval process similar to that in the U.S. in virtually every foreign target market for our products in order to commercialize our product candidates in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S. The resulting prices may not be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our corporate collaborators.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no 
 13

reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the U.S. will be sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, or that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan drug designation, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, 
 14

advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
 In the U.S., third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our products or product candidates, including INGREZZA, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 15

The marketability of any product or product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports, specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private third-party payor.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, the current presidential administration has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the newly enacted federal income tax law, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, the current presidential administration signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to

determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the current presidential administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which will be fully implemented in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. 
 Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the current presidential administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the current presidential administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective Congress and the current presidential administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, government agencies and academic institutions. Competition may also arise from, among other things:

• | other drug development technologies;
--+-------------------------------------


• | methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Developments by others may render our products, product candidates, or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.

In April 2017, INGREZZA, was approved by the FDA for TD. There are currently two FDA approved drug therapies for TD; INGREZZA and AUSTEDO® (deutetrabenazine), a deuterium labeled version of XENAZINE® (tetrabenazine) and VMAT2 inhibitor that was developed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva). In addition, off-label treatment regimens for TD consist of utilizing various atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), benzodiazepines (off-label) or botulinum toxin injections to treat the movements associated with TD.
 Other potential indications for our VMAT2 inhibitors include the chorea associated with Huntington’s disease, tardive dystonia, and other potential diseases and disorders. Currently, AUSTEDO, XENAZINE, which is marketed by Lundbeck, and generic alternatives to XENAZINE are approved for the chorea associated with Huntington’s disease.
 On July 24, 2018, AbbVie, in collaboration with us, announced FDA approval for ORILISSA for the management of endometriosis with associated moderate to severe pain in women. In addition, in conjunction with our partner AbbVie, we are developing elagolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. AbbVie initiated Phase III studies of elagolix in patients with uterine fibroids in early 2016. The Phase III program included two replicate, pivotal, six-month efficacy and safety studies followed by a six-month safety and efficacy extension study. AbbVie provided positive top-line efficacy data from the two Phase III studies in women with uterine fibroids in the first quarter of 2018 and additional data from the six-month safety extension study in the third quarter of 2018. We believe the results from these studies will form the basis for an anticipated NDA submission to the FDA in 2019 for the approval of elagolix in the treatment of uterine fibroids. There are no current pharmaceutical therapies approved in the U.S. for the chronic treatment of uterine fibroids. ObsEva SA has initiated a Phase IIb endometriosis study with its GnRH receptor antagonist, OBE2109, and has initiated Phase III studies of uterine fibroids patients with the same molecule. Myovant Sciences, Inc. is investigating its GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix, in Phase III trials of endometriosis, uterine fibroids and prostate cancer patients. LUPRON DEPOT® (leuprolide), marketed by AbbVie, is approved for short-term use to improve the outcome of uterine fibroid surgery. However, approximately 250,000 hysterectomies are performed annually in the U.S. as a direct result of uterine fibroids, as well as myomectomies (surgery) to remove the fibroids. Our oral small molecule pharmaceutical agent, elagolix, would compete directly with these current invasive standards of care.
 LUPRON DEPOT, SYNAREL® (nafarelin), and depo-subQ provera104® (medroxyprogesterone), which are marketed by Pfizer, are products that have been approved for the treatment of endometriosis, infertility, and central precocious puberty. These drugs, and any generic alternatives, may compete with any small molecule non-peptide GnRH antagonists we, in conjunction with our collaborative partner AbbVie, develop for these indications. Approximately 130,000 hysterectomies are performed annually in the U.S. as a direct result of endometriosis, as well as a significant number of laparoscopic procedures to ablate endometrial explants. Our oral small molecule pharmaceutical agent, elagolix, would also compete directly with these current invasive standards of care.
 Opicapone is a COMT inhibitor to be utilized as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. COMT inhibitors prolong the duration of effect of levodopa which is the primary treatment option for Parkinson’s disease patients. There are currently two FDA approved COMT inhibitors, COMTAN® (entacapone) originally developed by Orion Pharma and TASMAR® (tolcapone) originally developed by Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. Opicapone would compete directly with these two drugs and their generic equivalents.
 NBI-74788 is currently being investigated for the treatment of classic CAH, for which there are limited therapies. High doses of corticosteroids are the current standard of care to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency as well as reduce the excessive ACTH levels. However, the level of dose as well as the duration of steroid use required to suppress ACTH is well above the normal physiological level of cortisol; resulting in metabolic syndrome, bone loss, growth impairment, and Cushing’s syndrome as common and serious side effects. Both Millendo Therapeutics, with its acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 inhibitor ATR-101, and Spruce Biosciences, with its CRF1 antagonist SPR001, are in clinical development for the treatment of classic CAH.
 If one or more of these competitive products or programs are successful, it may reduce or eliminate the market for our products.
 Compared to us, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater:
  
• | capital resources;
