ITEM 1. Business. 
General Development of Business 
 Hexcel Corporation, founded in 1946, was incorporated in California in 1948, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1983. Hexcel Corporation and its subsidiaries (herein referred to as “Hexcel”, “the Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), is a leading advanced composites company. We develop, manufacture, and market lightweight, high-performance structural materials, including carbon fibers, specialty reinforcements, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, honeycomb, adhesives, engineered honeycomb and composite structures, for use in Commercial Aerospace, Space & Defense and Industrial markets. Our products are used in a wide variety of end applications, such as commercial and military aircraft, space launch vehicles and satellites, wind turbine blades, automotive, recreational products and other industrial applications. Our composite solutions enable our customers to improve the performance of their products by reducing weight while enhancing strength and durability.  
 We serve international markets through manufacturing facilities, sales offices and representatives located in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Russia, India and Africa. We also have a presence in Malaysia where we are a partner in a joint venture which manufactures composite structures for Commercial Aerospace applications.
 On January 3, 2019, we acquired ARC Technologies, LLC, a leading supplier of custom RF/EMI and microwave absorbing composite materials for military, aerospace and industrial applications. The acquisition strengthens our existing advanced materials portfolio in structural composites and thermoplastics.
 We are a manufacturer of products within a single industry: Advanced Composites. Hexcel has two reportable segments: Composite Materials and Engineered Products. The Composite Materials segment is comprised of our carbon fiber, specialty reinforcements, resins, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, and honeycomb core product lines and pultruded profiles. The Engineered Products segment is comprised of lightweight high strength composite structures, engineered core and honeycomb products with added functionality, and additive manufacturing. 
 The following summaries describe the ongoing activities related to the Composite Materials and Engineered Products segments as of December 31, 2018. 
 Composite Materials 
 The Composite Materials segment manufactures and markets carbon fibers, fabrics and specialty reinforcements, prepregs and other fiber-reinforced matrix materials, structural adhesives, honeycomb, molding compounds, tooling materials, polyurethane systems and laminates that are incorporated into many applications, including military and commercial aircraft, wind turbine blades, recreational products, transport (cars, boats, trains) and other industrial applications.

 Carbon Fibers: HexTow® carbon fibers are manufactured for sale to third-party customers as well as for our own use in manufacturing certain reinforcements and composite materials. Carbon fibers are also woven into carbon fabrics, used as reinforcement in conjunction with a resin matrix to produce pre-impregnated composite materials (referred to as “prepregs”). Carbon fiber is also used in filament winding to produce finished composite components. Key product applications include structural components for commercial and military aircraft, space launch vehicles, and certain other applications such as recreational and industrial equipment.
 Fabrics, Multi-axials and Specialty Reinforcements: HexForce® fabrics, multi-axials and specialty reinforcements are made from a variety of fibers, including carbon, glass, aramid and other high strength polymers, quartz, ceramic and other specialty fibers. These reinforcements are used in the production of prepregs and other matrix materials for third-party customers as well as for our own use. They are also used in the manufacture of a variety of industrial and recreational products such as wind energy blades, automotive components, oil exploration and production equipment, boats, surfboards, skis and other sporting goods equipment. 
 Prepregs: HexPly® prepregs are manufactured for sale to third-party customers and for internal use by our Engineered Products segment in manufacturing composite laminates and monolithic structures. Prepregs are used in primary and secondary structural aerospace applications such as wing components, horizontal and vertical stabilizer components, fairings, radomes and engine fan blades and cases, engine nacelles as well as overhead storage bins and other interior components. They are also used in many of the industrial and recreational products noted above.  Prepregs are manufactured by combining high-performance reinforcement fabrics or unidirectional fibers with a resin matrix to form a composite material that, when cured, has exceptional structural properties not present in either of the constituent materials. Prepregs are applied via hand layup, automatic tape layup and advanced fiber placement to produce finished composite components.  Prepreg reinforcements include glass, carbon, aramid, quartz, ceramic and other specialty fibers. Resin matrices include bismaleimide, cyanate ester, epoxy, phenolic, polyimide and other specialty resins.

Other Fiber-Reinforced Matrix Materials: Fiber reinforced matrix developments include HexMC®, a form of quasi-isotropic carbon fiber prepreg that enables small to medium sized, complex-shaped, composite components to be mass produced. HexTool® is a specialized form of HexMC® for use in the cost-effective construction of high temperature resistant composite tooling. HexFIT® film infusion material is a product that combines resin films and dry fiber reinforcements to save lay-up time in production and enables the manufacture of large contoured composite structures, such as wind turbine blades. 
 Resins: HexFlow® polymer matrix materials are sold in liquid and film form for use in direct process manufacturing of composite parts. Resins can be combined with fiber reinforcements in manufacturing processes such as resin transfer molding (“RTM”), resin film infusion (“RFI”) or vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (“VARTM”) to produce high quality composite components for both aerospace and industrial applications, without the need for customer investment in autoclaves. 
 Structural Adhesives: We manufacture and market a comprehensive range of Redux® and HexBondTM film and paste adhesives. These structural adhesives, which bond metal to metal and composites and honeycomb structures, are used in the aerospace industry and for many industrial applications. 
 Honeycomb: HexWeb® honeycomb is a lightweight, cellular structure generally composed of a sheet of nested hexagonal cells. It can also be manufactured in over-expanded and asymmetric cell configurations to meet special design requirements such as contours or complex curvatures. Honeycomb is primarily used as a lightweight core material and acts as a highly efficient energy absorber. When sandwiched between composite or metallic facing skins, honeycomb significantly increases the stiffness of the structure, while adding very little weight. 
 We produce honeycomb from a number of metallic and non-metallic materials. Most metallic honeycomb is made from aluminum and is available in a selection of alloys, cell sizes and dimensions. Non-metallic materials used in the manufacture of honeycomb include fiberglass, carbon fiber, thermoplastics, non-flammable aramid papers, aramid fiber and other specialty materials. 
 We sell honeycomb as standard blocks and in slices cut from a block. Honeycomb is also used in Acousti-Cap® where a non-metallic, permeable cap material is embedded into honeycomb core that is used in aircraft engine nacelles to dramatically reduce noise during takeoff and landing without adding a structural weight penalty. Aerospace is the largest market for honeycomb products. In addition, we produce honeycomb for our Engineered Products segment for use in manufacturing finished parts for airframe Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). 
 Polyspeed® Pultruded profiles:  Hexcel manufactures a wide range of pultruded sections including rods, flat sections, tubes and specific profiles that are usually made from carbon fiber but can also be made from glass, quartz, basalt or other fibers.  The profile matrix is a Hexcel formulation of thermoset resin (epoxy or polyurethane).  Hexcel pultruded profiles are used in a wide range of industrial applications.

Commercial Aerospace 
 The Commercial Aerospace industry is our largest user of advanced composites. Commercial Aerospace represented 70% of our 2018 net sales. Approximately 87% of these revenues can be identified as sales to Airbus, Boeing and their subcontractors for the production of commercial aircraft. The remaining 13% of these revenues were for regional, and business and other commercial aircraft. The economic benefits airlines can obtain from weight savings in both fuel economy and aircraft range, combined with the

design enhancement that comes from the advantages of advanced composites over traditional materials, has resulted in the aerospace industry becoming the leader in the adoption and use of these materials. While military aircraft and spacecraft have championed the development of these materials, Commercial Aerospace has had the greater production volumes and has commercialized the use of these products. Accordingly, the demand for advanced structural material products is closely correlated to the demand for new commercial aircraft. 
 The use of advanced composites in Commercial Aerospace is primarily in the manufacture of new commercial aircraft. The aftermarket for these products is very small as many of these materials are designed to last for the life of the aircraft. The demand for new commercial aircraft is driven by two principal factors, the first of which is airline passenger traffic (the number of revenue passenger miles flown by the airlines) which affects the required size of airline fleets. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates 2018 (as of November 2018) revenue passenger miles were 6.2% higher than 2017. Growth in passenger traffic requires growth in the size of the fleet of commercial aircraft operated by airlines worldwide. 
 A second factor, which is less sensitive to the general economy, is the replacement rates for existing aircraft. The rates of retirement of passenger and freight aircraft, resulting mainly from obsolescence, are determined in part by the regulatory requirements established by various civil aviation authorities worldwide as well as public concern regarding aircraft age, safety and noise. These rates may also be affected by the desire of the various airlines to improve operating costs with higher payloads and more fuel-efficient aircraft (which in turn is influenced by the price of fuel) and by reducing maintenance expense. In addition, there is expected to be increasing pressure on airlines to replace their aging fleet with more fuel efficient and quieter aircraft to be more environmentally responsible. When aircraft are retired from commercial airline fleets, they may be converted to cargo freight aircraft, used for parts or scrapped. 
 An additional factor that may cause airlines to defer or cancel orders is their ability to obtain financing, including leasing, for new aircraft orders. This will be dependent both upon the financial health of the airline operators, as well as the overall availability of financing in the marketplace. 
 Each new generation of commercial aircraft has used increasing quantities of advanced composites, replacing metals. This follows the trend previously seen in military fighter aircraft where advanced composites may now exceed 50% of the weight of the airframe. Early versions of commercial jet aircraft, such as the Boeing 707, which was developed in the early 1950’s, contained almost no composite materials. One of the first commercial aircraft to use a meaningful amount of composite materials, the Boeing 767 entered into service in 1983, and was built with an airframe containing approximately 6% composite materials. The airframe of Boeing’s 777 aircraft, which entered service in 1995, is approximately 11% composite. The Airbus A380, which was first delivered in 2007, has approximately 23% composite content by weight. Boeing’s B787, which entered into service in 2011, has a content of more than 50% composite materials by weight. The Airbus A350 XWB (“A350”) which has a composite content of 53% by weight was first delivered in December 2014.  Both Airbus and Boeing have introduced new versions of their narrow body aircraft which have new engines. Airbus’s A320neo had its first customer delivery in 2016 and Boeing’s B737 MAX entered into service in 2017. In 2014, Airbus announced a new version of its A330, the A330neo, which have new engines, and Boeing announced the B777X, a new version of the B777 with composite wings and new engines.  It is expected that new aircraft will offer more opportunities for composite materials than their predecessors, as the Commercial Aerospace industry continues to utilize a greater proportion of advanced composite materials with each new generation of aircraft. We refer to this steady expansion of the use of composites in aircraft as the “secular penetration of composites” as it increases our average sales per airplane over time. 
 The impact on Hexcel of Airbus and Boeing’s production rate changes is typically influenced by two factors: the mix of aircraft produced and the inventory supply chain effects of increases or reductions in aircraft production. We have products on all Airbus and Boeing planes. The dollar value of our materials varies by aircraft type — twin aisle aircraft use more of our materials than narrow body aircraft and newer designed aircraft use more of our materials than older generations. On average, for established programs, we deliver products into the supply chain about six months prior to aircraft delivery, with a range between one and eighteen months depending on the product. For aircraft that are in the development or ramp-up stage, such as the A330neo and the B777X, we will have sales as much as several years in advance of the delivery. Increased aircraft deliveries combined with the secular penetration of composites resulted in our Commercial Aerospace revenues increasing, year over year, by approximately 8.2% in 2018 and 11% in 2016. The slight decline in Commercial Aerospace revenues in 2017 was as a result of older wide body aircraft models being phased out as the new narrow body programs ramped up.

Approximately 87% of our Commercial Aerospace revenues can be identified as sales to Airbus, Boeing and their subcontractors for the production of commercial aircraft. Airbus and Boeing combined deliveries in 2018 were 1,606 aircraft, surpassing the previous high of 1,493 in 2017. In 2018, the combined net orders reported by Airbus and Boeing were for 1,640 planes, bringing their backlog at December 31, 2018 to 13,528 planes or over eight years based on 2018 deliveries. The balance of our Commercial Aerospace sales is related to regional and business aircraft manufacture, and other commercial aircraft applications. These applications also exhibit increasing utilization of composite materials with each new generation of aircraft. 
 Space & Defense 
 The Space & Defense market has historically been an innovator in the use of, and source of significant demand for, advanced composites. The aggregate demand by Space & Defense customers is primarily a function of procurement of military aircraft that utilize advanced composites by the United States and certain European governments, including both commercial and military helicopters. We are qualified to supply materials to a broad range of helicopter, military aircraft and space programs, including the Lockheed Martin F-35 (joint strike fighter or JSF), Boeing V-22 (Osprey) tilt rotor aircraft, Black Hawk and Airbus A400M military transport. No one program accounts for more than 12% of our revenues in this market. The sales that we obtain from these programs will depend upon which are funded and the extent of such funding. Space applications for advanced composites include solid rocket booster cases, fairings and payload doors for launch vehicles, and satellite buss and solar arrays for military and commercial satellites. 
 Another trend providing positive growth for Hexcel is the further penetration of composites in helicopter blades. Numerous new helicopter programs in development, as well as upgrade or retrofit programs, have an increased utilization of Composite Materials products such as carbon fiber, prepregs, and honeycomb core to improve blade performance. In addition, our Engineered Products segment provides specialty value added services such as machining, sub-assembly, and even full blade manufacturing for rotocraft.
 Contracts for military and some commercial programs may contain provisions applicable to both U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. For example, a prime contractor may flow down a “termination for convenience” clause to materials suppliers such as Hexcel. According to the terms of a contract, we may be subject to U.S. government Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement, and associated procurement regulations. 
 Industrial  
 The revenue from this market includes wind turbine blades, automotive, a wide variety of recreational products and other industrial applications. A number of these applications represent emerging opportunities for our products. In developing new applications, we seek those opportunities where advanced composites technology offers significant benefits to the end user, often applications that demand high engineering performance. Within the Industrial markets, wind energy comprises the largest submarket and our primary customer is Vestas Wind Systems A/S (“Vestas”).  The Industrial markets also include sales to major end user sub-markets, in order of size based on our 2018 sales: general industrial applications (including those sold through distributors), transportation (e.g., automobiles, mass transit and high-speed rail, and marine applications) and recreational equipment (e.g., skis and snowboards, bicycles and hockey sticks). Our participation in Industrial applications complements our commercial and military aerospace businesses, and in many instances, technology or products now used in aerospace were started in Industrial. We are committed to pursuing the utilization of advanced structural material technology where it can generate significant value and we can maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. 
 Further discussion of our markets, including certain risks, uncertainties and other factors with respect to “forward-looking statements” about those markets, is contained under the captions “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Forward Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”.

Backlog 
 In recent years, our customers have demanded shorter order lead times and “just-in-time” delivery performance. While we have many multi-year contracts with our major aerospace customers and our largest Industrial customer, most of these contracts specify the proportion of the customers’ requirements that will be supplied by us and the terms under which the sales will occur, not the specific quantities to be procured or the specific dates for delivery. Our Industrial customers have always desired to order their requirements on as short a lead-time as possible. As a result, twelve-month order backlog is not a meaningful trend indicator for us. As noted above, our Commercial Aerospace sales to Airbus and Boeing and their subcontractors accounted for 61% of our total 2018 sales, and their airplane backlog is over eight years based on 2018 deliveries. 
Raw Materials and Production Activities 
 Our manufacturing operations are in many cases vertically integrated. We produce and internally use carbon fibers, industrial fabrics, composite materials and composite structures as well as sell these materials to third-party customers for their use in the manufacture of their products. 
 We manufacture high performance carbon fiber from polyacrylonitrile precursor (“PAN”). The primary raw material for PAN is acrylonitrile. All of the PAN we produce is for internal carbon fiber production. We consume more than 75% by value of the carbon fiber we produce and sell the remainder of our output to third-party customers. However, as one of the world’s largest consumers of high performance carbon fiber, we also purchase significant quantities of carbon fiber from external sources for our own use. The sources of carbon fiber we can use in any product or application are generally dictated by customer qualifications or certifications. Otherwise, we select a carbon fiber based on performance, price and availability. With the increasing demand for carbon fiber, particularly in aerospace applications, in recent years we have significantly increased our PAN and carbon fiber capacity to serve the growing needs of our customers and our own downstream products. After a new production line starts operating, it can take up to a year to be certified for aerospace qualifications. However, these lines can start supplying carbon fiber for many industrial applications within a shorter time period. 
 We purchase glass yarn from a number of suppliers in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also purchase aramid and high strength fibers which are produced by only a few companies, and during periods of high demand, can be in short supply. In addition, epoxy and other specialty resins, aramid paper and aluminum specialty foils are used in the manufacture of composite products. A number of these products have only one or two sources qualified for use, so an interruption in their supply could disrupt our ability to meet our customer requirements. When entering into multi-year contracts with aerospace customers, we attempt to get back-to-back commitments from key raw material suppliers. 
 Our manufacturing activities are primarily based on “make-to-order”, or “demand pull” based on customer schedules, and to a lesser extent, “make-to-forecast” production requirements. We coordinate closely with key suppliers in an effort to avoid raw material shortages and excess inventories. However, many of the key raw materials we consume are available from relatively few sources, and in many cases the cost of product qualification makes it impractical to develop multiple sources of supply. The lack of availability of these materials could under certain circumstances have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. 
 Research and Technology; Patents and Know-How 
 Research and Technology (“R&T”) departments support our businesses worldwide. Through R&T activities, we maintain expertise in precursor and carbon fiber, chemical and polymer formulation and curatives, fabric forming and textile architectures, advanced composite structures, process engineering, application development, analysis and testing of composite materials, computational design, and other scientific disciplines related to our worldwide business base. 
 Our products rely primarily on our expertise in materials science, textiles, process engineering and polymer chemistry. Consistent with market demand, we have been placing more emphasis on higher performing products and cost effective production processes while seeking to improve the consistency of our products and our capital efficiency. Towards this end, we have entered into formal and informal alliances, as well as licensing and teaming arrangements, with several customers, suppliers, external agencies and laboratories. We believe that we possess unique capabilities to design, develop, manufacture and qualify composite materials and structures, including trade secrets and extensive internal knowledge gained from decades of experience. We have more than 1,615 patents and pending applications worldwide, and have granted technology licenses and patent rights to several third parties primarily in connection with joint ventures and joint development programs. It is our policy to actively enforce our proprietary rights. We believe that the patents and know-how rights currently owned or licensed by Hexcel are adequate for the conduct of our business. We do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any single patent or series of related patents, or by the termination of any single license agreement or series of related license agreements.

We spent $55.9 million, $49.4 million and $46.9 million for R&T in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our spending, on a constant currency basis, in 2018 was more than 11% higher than 2017 and in 2017 was more than 6% higher than 2016. Our spending on a quarter to quarter basis fluctuates depending upon the amount of new product development and qualification activities, particularly in relation to commercial aircraft applications, that are in progress. These expenditures are expensed as incurred. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various U.S. and international federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We are also subject to liabilities arising under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and similar state local and international laws and regulations that impose responsibility for the control, remediation and abatement of air, water and soil pollutants and the manufacturing, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations.
 Our aggregate environmental related accruals at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $2.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, were included in “Other current accrued liabilities”, with the remainder included in “Other non-current liabilities”. As related to certain of our environmental matters, our accruals were estimated at the low end of a range of possible outcomes since there was no better point within the range. If we had accrued, for those sites where we are able to estimate our liability, at the high end of the range of possible outcomes, our accruals would have been $16 million higher at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Environmental remediation spending charged directly to our reserve balance for 2018, 2017 and 2016, was $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively. In addition, our operating costs relating to environmental compliance were $15.6 million, $9.9 million and $10.1 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and were charged directly to expense. Capital expenditures for environmental matters approximated $6.9 million, $8.4 million and $13.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. 
 These accruals can change significantly from period to period due to such factors as additional information on the nature or extent of contamination, the methods of remediation required, changes in the apportionment of costs among responsible parties and other actions by governmental agencies or private parties, as well as the impact, if any, of Hexcel being named in a new matter. A discussion of environmental matters is contained in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” and in Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 A staff of salaried marketing managers, product managers and sales personnel, sell and market our products directly to customers worldwide. We also use independent distributors and manufacturer representatives for certain products, markets and regions. In addition, we operate various sales representation offices in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Russia and Africa. 
Competition 
 In the production and sale of advanced composites, we compete with a number of U.S. and international companies on a worldwide basis. The broad markets for composites are highly competitive, and we have focused on both specific submarkets and specialty products within markets. In addition to competing directly with companies offering similar products, we compete with producers of substitute composites such as structural foam, infusion technology, wood and metal. Depending upon the material and markets, relevant competitive factors include approvals, database of usage, technology, product performance, delivery, service, price, customer preference for sole sourcing and customer preferred processes. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 6,626 full-time employees and contract workers, 3,567 in the United States and 3,059 in other countries. We employ a minimal number of contract workers. Of the 6,626 full-time employees, approximately 17% were represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with employees and unions are good. The number of full-time employees and contract workers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 6,259 and 6,155, respectively.
