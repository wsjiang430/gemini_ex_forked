We have a vision to create transformative products and experiences that build meaningful connections, unlocking greater possibility and wellbeing for all. Since our inception, we have fostered a distinctive corporate culture; we promote a set of core values in our business which include taking personal responsibility, acting with courage, valuing connection and inclusion, and choosing to have fun.

(together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as "lululemon," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our."

Our Products
We offer a comprehensive line of performance apparel, footwear, and accessories marketed under the lululemon brand. Our apparel assortment includes items such as pants, shorts, tops, and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle including 
athletic activities such as yoga, running, training, and most other activities. We also offer apparel designed for being on the move and fitness-inspired accessories. We expect to continue to broaden our merchandise offerings through expansion across these product areas. 
Our design and development team continues to source technically advanced fabrics, with new feel and fit, and craft innovative functional features for our products. Through our vertical retail strategy and direct connection with our customers, whom we refer to as guests, we are able to collect feedback and incorporate unique performance and fashion needs into our design process. In this way, we believe we are better positioned to address the needs of our guests, helping us advance our product lines and differentiate us from the competition.
To help build our community of guests, and as part of our membership program, we offer in-home connected fitness and associated content subscriptions through lululemon Studio.
Our Market
Our guests seek a combination of performance, style, and sensation in their athletic apparel, choosing products that allow them to feel great however they exercise. Since consumer purchase decisions are driven by both an actual need for functional products and a desire to live a particular lifestyle, we believe the credibility of our brand and the authentic community experiences we offer expand our potential market beyond just athletes to those who pursue an active, mindful, and balanced life.
Although our largest customer group is made up of guests who shop our women's range, representing 65% of our 2022 net revenue, we also design a comprehensive men's line and have a targeted strategy in place. Revenue from our men's range is growing as more guests discover the technical rigor and premium quality of our men's products, and are attracted by our distinctive brand.
North America is our largest market by geographical split, representing 84% of our 2022 net revenue. We are expanding internationally across the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), the rest of Asia Pacific, and Europe. We are expanding in these regions via a decentralized model, allowing for local community insight and consumer preference to inform our strategic expansion.
Our Segments
We primarily conduct our business through two channels: company-operated stores and direct to consumer. 
We also operate outlets, serve certain wholesale accounts, have license and supply arrangements, sell repurchased product through our "Like New" recommerce program, have temporary locations, and sell connected hardware and associated subscriptions through lululemon Studio. The financial results of these operations are disclosed in Other.
Company-Operated Stores
At the end of 2022, we operated 655 stores in 18 countries across the globe. In addition to being a venue to sell our products, our stores give us a direct connection to our guest, which we view as a valuable tool in helping us build our brand and product line. Our retail stores are located primarily on street locations, in lifestyle centers, and in malls.

__________
(1)PRC included 99 stores in China Mainland, nine stores in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, seven stores in Taiwan, and two stores in Macao Special Administration Region, as of January 29, 2023. As of January 30, 2022, there were 70 stores in China Mainland, nine stores in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, five stores in Taiwan, and two stores in Macao Special Administration Region.
Retail locations operated by third parties under license and supply arrangements are not included in the above table. As of January 29, 2023, there were 26 licensed locations, including 12 in Mexico, seven in the United Arab Emirates, three in Qatar, three in Saudi Arabia, and one in Kuwait. 
We opened 81 net new company-operated stores in 2022, including 49 net new stores outside of North America.
We perform ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of company-operated store locations. During 2022, we closed six of our lululemon branded company-operated stores. As we continue our evaluations we may, in the future, close or relocate additional company-operated stores.
In 2023, we believe our new store growth will come primarily from company-operated store openings in the United States and the PRC. We expect our real estate strategy over the next several years to not only consist of opening new company-operated stores, but also to include overall square footage growth through store expansions and relocations.
We believe that our innovative retail concept and guest experience contribute to the success of our stores. We use sales per square foot to assess the performance of our company-operated stores relative to their square footage. We believe that sales per square foot is useful in evaluating the performance of our company-operated stores. Our sales per square foot was $1,580 and $1,443 for 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Sales per square foot is calculated using total net revenue from all company-operated stores divided by the average square footage of the stores during the year. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of sales per square foot. The square footage of our company-operated stores includes all retail related space, storage areas, and administrative space used by the store employees. It excludes any space used for non-retail related 
activities. The sales per square foot metric we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled metrics reported by other companies.
Direct to Consumer
We believe e-commerce is convenient for our core guest and enhances the image of our brand. Our direct to consumer channel also allows us to reach and serve guests in markets beyond where our physical retail locations are based. We believe this channel is effective in building brand awareness, especially in new markets.
We serve our guests via our e-commerce website www.lululemon.com, other country and region-specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers or other retail locations.
We continue to evolve and integrate our digital and physical channels in order to enrich our interactions with our guests, and to provide an enhanced omni-channel experience.
Other
Our other operations primarily include:
•Outlets - We utilize outlets to sell slow moving inventory and inventory from prior seasons at discounted prices. As of January 29, 2023, we operated 39 outlets, with the majority in North America.
•Wholesale - We sell to premium wholesale locations that offer an alternative distribution channel that is convenient for our core guest and enhances the image of our brand, including yoga and fitness studios, university campus retailers, and other select partners. We do not intend wholesale to be a significant contributor to overall sales. Instead, we use the channel to build brand awareness, including outside of North America.
•License and supply arrangements - We enter into license and supply arrangements from time to time when we believe it will be to our advantage to partner with companies and individuals with significant experience and proven success in certain target markets.
We have license and supply arrangements with partners in the Middle East and Mexico which grant them the right to operate lululemon branded retail locations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Mexico. Under these arrangements we supply the partners with lululemon products, training and other support. An extension to the initial term of the agreement for the Middle East was signed in 2020 and it extends the arrangement to December 2024. The initial term of the agreement for Mexico expires in November 2026. As of January 29, 2023, there was also an e-commerce website operated through the license and supply arrangements. 
•Recommerce - Our recommerce is the sale of repurchased product via our "Like New" program. This program allows guests to exchange their gently used lululemon products for credit, and then those products are verified and quality checked before being resold online at likenew.lululemon.com. We believe this program is a step towards a circular eco-system and achieving our Impact Agenda goals to reduce our environmental footprint. 
•Temporary locations - Our temporary locations, including pop ups, are typically opened for a short period of time. We believe these retail locations enable us to serve guests during peak shopping periods in markets where we do not ordinarily have a physical location, or enable us to better serve our guest in markets where we see high demand at our existing locations.
•lululemon Studio - We offer in-home fitness through an interactive workout platform that allows our guests to subscribe for live and on-demand classes. 
Integrated Marketing
We have a multi-faceted strategy to build brand awareness, affinity and guest loyalty. This strategy leverages owned and paid channels, our ambassador network, brand partners, events, and content – to drive awareness, consideration, engagement, conversion, and ultimately loyalty and engagement at the global, regional, and local levels.
Product Design and Development
Our product design and development efforts are led by a team of researchers, scientists, engineers, and designers. Our team is comprised of athletes and users of our products who embody our design philosophy and dedication to premium 
quality. Our design and development team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our guests and our ambassadors, and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of function, style, and technical superiority.
As we strive to continue to provide our guests with technically advanced fabrics, our team works closely with our suppliers to incorporate the latest in technical innovation, bringing particular specifications to our products. We partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including pilling, shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and colorfastness. We develop proprietary fabrics and collaborate with leading fabric and trims suppliers to manufacture fabrics and trims that we generally seek to protect through agreements, trademarks, and as trade-secrets.
Sourcing and Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide fabrics for, and to produce, our products. The following statistics are based on cost.
We work with a group of approximately 45 vendors that manufacture our products, five of which produced 56% of our products in 2022, with the largest manufacturer producing 15%. During 2022, 39% of our products were manufactured in Vietnam, 14% in Cambodia, 12% in Sri Lanka, 8% in Bangladesh, and 7% in Indonesia, and the remainder in other regions.
We work with a group of approximately 60 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. In 2022, 56% of our fabrics were produced by our top five fabric suppliers, with the largest manufacturer producing 21%. During 2022, 43% of our fabrics originated from Taiwan, 19% from China Mainland, 16% from Sri Lanka, and the remainder from other regions. 
We also source other raw materials which are used in our products, including items such as content labels, elastics, buttons, clasps, and drawcords from suppliers located predominantly in the Asia Pacific region.
We have developed long-standing relationships with a number of our vendors and take great care to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term contracts with the majority of our suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of our fabrics and garments, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, and production. We require that all of our manufacturers adhere to our Vendor Code of Ethics regarding social and environmental sustainability practices. Our product quality and sustainability teams closely assess and monitor each supplier's compliance with applicable laws and our Vendor Code of Ethics, including by partnering with leading inspection and verification firms.
Distribution Facilities
We operate and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. We own our distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, and lease our other distribution facilities. We also utilize third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from their warehouse locations in the United States, the PRC, and the Netherlands. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and consolidate or expand our distribution capacity as we believe appropriate for our operations and to meet anticipated needs.
Competition
Competition in the athletic apparel industry is based principally on brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe we successfully compete on the basis of our premium brand image and our technical product innovation. We also believe our ability to introduce new product innovations, combine function and fashion, and connect through in-store, online, and community experiences sets us apart from our competition. In addition, we believe our vertical retail distribution strategy and community-based marketing differentiates us further, allowing us to more effectively control our brand image and connect with our guest.
The market for athletic apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. We are in direct competition with wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel and footwear, such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, PUMA, Under Armour, Inc, and Columbia Sportswear Company. We also compete with retailers who have expanded to include women's athletic apparel including The Gap, Inc. (including the Athleta brand), Victoria's Secret with its sport and lounge offering, and Urban Outfitters, Inc.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season, while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating profits are typically generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 44% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarter of 2021. Our operating profits in 2022 were not weighted towards our fourth quarter primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other assets recognized in relation to our lululemon Studio business unit during that quarter. We generated approximately 24% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impairment of goodwill and other assets recognized in relation to lululemon Studio (formerly MIRROR), we generated approximately 44% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
Human Capital
Our Impact Agenda sets out our social and environmental goals, commitments, and strategy across three pillars - Be Well, Be Planet, and Be Human. Details of our Impact Agenda and corresponding Impact Report can be found on our website (https://corporate.lululemon.com/our-impact). 
The Be Human pillar of our Impact Agenda sets out our focus areas with respect to our human capital, including our employees and broader community:
•advancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action (“IDEA”);
•empowering our employees through whole-person opportunities; and
•supporting the well-being of the people who make our products in our supply chain. 
Advancing a culture of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Action
We continually endeavor to create an environment that is equitable, inclusive, and fosters personal growth.
Diversity and inclusion are key components of our culture and are fundamental to achieving our strategic priorities and future vision. The diversity of our teams and working in an inclusive culture enables increased employee engagement, better decision making, greater adaptability, creativity, and a deeper understanding of the communities we serve. We are proud that as of January 29, 2023, approximately 55% of our board of directors, 65% of our senior executive leadership team, and 45% of our vice presidents and above are women, while approximately 75% of our overall workforce are women.(1)
We measure the current state of diverse representation and organizational inclusion health through an annual voluntary survey.(2) In 2022, the participation rate was approximately 70%. Our overall goal is to reflect the racial diversity(3) of the communities we serve and operate in.

(1) While we track male and female genders, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities. 
(2) The voluntary demographic survey results presented above relate to all of our employees in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. 
(3) "Racial diversity" is used to measure the non-white population.
We seek to maintain 100% gender pay equity within our entire global employee population, meaning equal pay for equal work across genders, by geography. We have achieved full pay equity, including gender and race, in the United States. We follow local laws and regulations and where we are able to collect the data necessary to confirm complete pay equity, we do so.
We offer all employees IDEA education, training, and guided conversations on a variety of topics, including anti-racism, anti-discrimination, and inclusive leadership behaviors. We have established People Networks, which are employee resource groups that represent employees who have marginalized and historically underrepresented identities. We see significant engagement in IDEA education and training across our global employee base. We aim to foster a culture of inclusion by making IDEA part of our everyday conversation, and frequently review our policies, programs, and practices to identify ways to be more inclusive and equitable. 
Inclusive in our Impact Agenda is a goal to invest a total of $75.0 million to advance equity in well-being by 2025. As of January 29, 2023, we have invested a total of $29.4 million(4) towards this goal. 
Empowering our employees through whole-person opportunities
We believe each of our approximately 34,000 people is key to the success of our business. We strive to foster a distinctive culture rooted in our core values that attracts and retains passionate and motivated employees who are driven to achieve personal and professional goals. We believe our people succeed because we create an environment that fosters growth and is diverse and equitable.
We assess our performance and identify opportunities for improvement through an annual employee engagement survey. In 2022, the participation rate was approximately 83% and our employee engagement score exceeded the retail industry average.(5) Our engagement score suggests our people are proud to work for lululemon, they are motivated to contribute to work that aligns with their purpose, and they recommend lululemon as a great place to work.
We understand that health and wealth programs need to offer choice at all stages of life. Our current offerings support our goal of becoming the number one place where people come to develop and grow as inclusive leaders. These offerings include, among other things: 
•Competitive compensation which rewards exceptional performance;
•A Fund your Future program for eligible employees which offers partial contribution matches to a pension plan and employee share purchase plan;
•An annual paid VALUES (Volunteer, Awareness, Life, Unity, Empowerment, Support) Day, competitive paid time off, and sick leave;
(4) We have contributed $29.4 million to lululemon's Centre for Social Impact, $21.2 million of which has been contributed directly to social impact organizations. The remaining $8.2 million includes $6.0 million toward a Donor-Advised-Fund to be advised for future grantmaking as well as operational costs.
(5) Based on an industry benchmark provided by the third party that administers this survey to our employees. 
•An employee discount program, which includes a lifetime discount to celebrate the contribution of our long-tenured employees to keep them within our collective, even when they have moved on to pursue goals outside of lululemon; 
•Reimbursement programs which reward physical activity;
•A parenthood program which is a gender-neutral benefit that provides all eligible employees up to six months of paid leave; 
•An employee assistance program which provides free confidential support to all our employees and their families in a variety of areas from mental well-being to financial services to advice for new parents; and
•Training and development of all of our employees including, but not limited to, mentorship programs, IDEA internships, leadership development, vision and goals, and coaching.
Supporting the well-being of the people who make our products in our supply chain 
We work with suppliers who share our values and collaborate as partners to uphold robust standards, address systemic challenges, and improve the well-being of people who make our products.
Our Vendor Code of Ethics outlines our commitment to respect human and labor rights, and to promote safe and fair working conditions for people in our supply chain. The code is based on international standards for workers' rights with regard to their employment, wages and working hours, occupational health and safety, access to confidential grievance mechanisms without retaliation, and environmental protection. Our finished goods and mill suppliers are assessed against the Vendor Code of Ethics prior to forming a business relationship, and regularly thereafter; we work with factories that can uphold our strict requirements.
Our Foreign Migrant Worker Standard outlines our expectations with respect to foreign migrant workers. This program helps to raise standards and build shared approaches that benefit garment workers.
Intellectual Property
We have trademark rights on many of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in building our brand image and in distinguishing our products from the products of others. We consider our lululemon and wave design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. In addition, we own many other trademarks for the names of several of our brands, slogans, fabrics and products. We own registered and pending U.S. and foreign utility and design patents, industrial designs in Canada, and registered community designs in Europe that protect our product innovations, distinctive apparel, and accessory designs.
