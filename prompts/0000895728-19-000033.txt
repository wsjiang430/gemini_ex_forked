ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Enbridge is one of North America's largest energy infrastructure companies with strategic business platforms that include an extensive network of crude oil, liquids and natural gas pipelines, regulated natural gas distribution utilities and renewable power generation. We safely deliver in excess of three million barrels of crude oil each day in North America through our Mainline and Express pipeline, and account for approximately 62% of United States-bound Canadian crude oil exports. We also move approximately 18% of all natural gas consumed in the United States, serving key supply basins and demand markets. Our regulated utilities serve approximately 3.7 million retail customers in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. We also have interests in more than 1,700 megawatts (MW) of net renewable power generation capacity in North America and Europe. Our common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ENB. We were incorporated on April 13, 1970 under the Companies Ordinance of the Northwest Territories and were continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on December 15, 1987.
A more detailed description of each of our businesses and underlying assets is provided below under Business Segments.
CORPORATE VISION AND STRATEGY
VISION
Our vision is to be the leading energy infrastructure company in North America. In pursuing this vision, we play a critical role in enabling the economic well-being and quality of life of North Americans, who depend on access to plentiful energy. We transport, distribute and generate energy, and our primary purpose is to deliver the energy North Americans need and want, in the safest, most reliable and most responsible way possible.
Among our peers, we strive to be a leader in several key areas that create sustainable comparative advantage and value for shareholders including: worker and public safety, environmental protection, stakeholder relations, customer service, community investment and employee satisfaction.
STRATEGY
Last year we announced a three year plan (the Strategic Plan) focused on growing our three core business lines - Liquids Pipelines, Natural Gas Pipelines and Gas Distribution within a regulated pipeline and utility model, while improving our competitive position through streamlining our businesses and strengthening our financial position. Within each of these business lines, our assets are well positioned to provide us with the scale and diversity to compete, grow and provide the energy people need and want. Our core assets generate highly predictable cash flows and are expected to create sustainable organic growth opportunities through the expansion and extension of our existing assets.
As discussed in further detail in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in 2018 we made significant progress on a number of the objectives set out in the Strategic Plan. Notably:

• | we monetized approximately $7.8 billion of non-core assets, some of which were less aligned with our regulated pipelines and utilities business model;


• | we strengthened our balance sheet, achieving long-term leverage targets ahead of schedule;


• | we streamlined and simplified our corporate structure through buying in four publicly-traded sponsored vehicles; and

7


• | we continued to execute on our industry-leading capital program, bringing $7 billion of new projects into service during the year and advancing our Line 3 Replacement Program (L3R Program) and other secured projects currently in progress through key regulatory milestones.

As a result of the actions we took in 2018, we are entering 2019 with a streamlined business model and organizational structure, a strong balance sheet and a renewed focus on securing additional growth.
While the relative degree of emphasis has shifted with the progress we made last year, our strategic priorities remain essentially unchanged as we seek to continue to grow the business and add value in pursuit of our longer term vision. The key priorities are summarized below.
Commitment to Safety and Operational Reliability
Safety and operational reliability remain the foundation of our Strategic Plan. Our commitment to safety and operational reliability means achieving and maintaining industry leadership in safety (process, public and personal) and ensuring the reliability and integrity of the systems we operate in order to generate, transport and deliver energy while protecting people and the environment.
Maintain a Strong Financial Position
The maintenance of our financial strength is critical to our strategy. Over the last year, execution of our funding plans together with selected asset divestitures have reduced consolidated leverage and strengthened our balance sheet. 
Our financing strategies are designed to achieve strong, investment grade credit ratings to ensure that we have the financial capacity to meet our capital funding needs, and the flexibility to manage capital market disruptions and respond to opportunities as they arise. Our current secured capital program, which extends beyond 2020, can be readily financed through internally generated cash flow and available balance sheet capacity without issuance of additional common equity, and we will seek to drive attractive growth post 2020 using this “self-funded” model. For further discussion on our financing strategies, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.
To reinforce our low-risk regulated pipeline and utility-like profile, we continue to closely monitor and manage controllable risks. This includes a comprehensive long-term economic hedging program to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity price on our earnings and cash flow as well as ongoing monitoring and management of credit exposures to customers, suppliers and counterparties. For further details, refer to Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Execute Capital Program
Successful project execution is integral to our financial performance but also to the strategic positioning of our business over the long term. Our ongoing objective is to deliver projects on time, on budget and at the lowest practical cost while maintaining the highest standards for safety, quality, customer satisfaction and environmental and regulatory compliance. For a discussion of our current portfolio of capital projects, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.
Complete Integration and Transformation
A heightened focus on efficiency and effectiveness continues to be a key priority. Given the increasingly competitive nature of our business, in 2016 we established a goal to reach top quartile cost performance while seeking opportunities to drive enhanced revenue from our operating businesses. To achieve this, we launched several projects to transform various processes, organizational capabilities and information systems infrastructure in order to improve how we do business. Several of these initiatives have been successfully completed, while others will continue into 2019 and 2020. 
8

A related priority for our gas distribution business is the effective integration of the operations and management of Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. (EGD) and Union Gas Limited (Union Gas) following the amalgamation of these two large natural gas distribution utilities effective January 1, 2019. The establishment of a new five-year incentive rate making model for the combined entity provides an opportunity to increase efficiencies and enhance returns while lowering customer energy costs.
Extend Growth Post 2020 
Our core assets are strategically positioned between key supply basins with strong demand pull, and are underpinned by low risk commercial structures: long-term contracts, regulated cost of service tolling frameworks, established customer bases and strong risk-adjusted returns. We will remain focused on growing post 2020 through investments in these types of assets, placing an even greater emphasis on capturing the very best of a large suite of potential organic growth opportunities with an emphasis on energy export opportunities. Opportunities will be screened, analyzed and assessed using a disciplined investment framework with the objective of ensuring effective deployment of capital to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.
In seeking to extend growth post 2020, we will continue to focus on maintaining our low risk, regulated pipeline and utility business model, utilizing the self-funding model described above to grow our core business, while taking a rigorous approach to capital allocation. Starting in 2020, we expect to generate $5 to $6 billion of available capital to reinvest in the business without raising external equity and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We currently see many promising organic growth opportunities in which to deploy available capital in the post 2020 period but will actively monitor the business landscape and assess these opportunities against other alternative uses for our capital on an ongoing basis in order to ensure value maximization. 
MAINTAIN THE FOUNDATION
Our success in executing on our strategic priorities is very much dependent on the way in which we conduct our business and the quality and capabilities of our people. These elements provide the “foundation” required to achieve our objectives and longer term vision. 
Uphold Enbridge Values
We adhere to a strong set of core values that govern how we conduct our business and pursue strategic priorities, as articulated in our value statement: “Enbridge employees demonstrate safety, integrity and respect in support of our communities, the environment and each other”. Employees are expected to uphold these values in their interactions with each other, customers, suppliers, landowners, community members and all others with whom we deal and ensure our business decisions are consistent with these values. Employees and contractors are required, on an annual basis, to certify their compliance with our Statement on Business Conduct, which encapsulates these values.
Build and Maintain the Confidence of Stakeholders and Decisions Makers
Earning and sustaining the trust of our key stakeholders and decision makers is critical to our ability to execute on our growth plans and ensure that our business strategy, as well as our corporate policies and management systems, are continuously informed by the social and environmental context surrounding our projects and operations. A key priority is to establish and maintain constructive relationships with local communities and other groups directly impacted by our activities over the life-cycle of our assets. The linear nature of our energy infrastructure puts us in contact with a large number of diverse communities, landowners and regulatory bodies across North America. Because Indigenous communities have distinct rights, we have dedicated accountabilities and resources focused on Indigenous consultation and inclusion. Early identification of local concerns enables us to respond quickly and take a proactive approach to problem solving. Early engagement also enables us to provide expanded opportunities for socio-economic participation through employment, training, and procurement, as well as through the development of joint initiatives on safety, environmental and cultural protection. More broadly, our goal is to build awareness and balanced dialogue on the role and value of the energy we deliver to our society and economy. We communicate with different stakeholders, decision makers, customers and other 
9

interested groups, including investors, employees and the public, about the access we provide to safe, reliable, and affordable energy.
We provide annual progress updates related to the above initiatives in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report which can be found at http://csr.enbridge.com. Unless otherwise specifically stated, none of the information contained on, or connected to, the Enbridge website is incorporated by reference in, or otherwise part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Attract, Retain and Develop Highly Capable People
Investing in the attraction, retention and development of employees and future leaders is fundamental to executing our growth strategy and creating sustainability for future success. We focus on enhancing the capability of our people to maximize the potential of our organization and undertake various activities such as accelerated leadership programs, rigorous succession planning of critical roles, and facilitating career development and mobility throughout the enterprise. We also value diversity and have embedded inclusive practices throughout our programs and approach to people management. Furthermore, we strive to maintain industry competitive compensation and retention programs that provide both short-term and long-term performance incentives to our employees.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Our activities are carried out through five business segments: Liquids Pipelines; Gas Transmission and Midstream; Gas Distribution; Green Power and Transmission; and Energy Services, as discussed below.
LIQUIDS PIPELINES
Liquids Pipelines consists of pipelines and related terminals in Canada and the United States that transport various grades of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons.
10

11

MAINLINE SYSTEM
The mainline system is comprised of the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The Canadian Mainline is a common carrier pipeline system which transports various grades of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons within western Canada and from western Canada to the Canada/United States border near Gretna, Manitoba and Neche, North Dakota and from the United States/Canada border near Port Huron, Michigan and Sarnia, Ontario to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. The Canadian Mainline includes six adjacent pipelines with a combined capacity of approximately 2.85 million barrels per day (bpd) that connect with the Lakehead System at the Canada/United States border, as well as five pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products into eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. We have operated, and frequently expanded, the Canadian Mainline since 1949. The Lakehead System is the portion of the mainline system in the United States. It is an interstate common carrier pipeline system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and is the primary transporter of crude oil and liquid petroleum from Western Canada to the United States. 
Competitive Toll Settlement
The Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS) is the current framework governing tolls paid for products shipped on the Canadian Mainline, with the exception of Lines 8 and 9 which are tolled on a separate basis. The 10-year settlement was negotiated by representatives of Enbridge, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and shippers on the Canadian Mainline. It was approved by the National Energy Board (NEB) on June 24, 2011 and took effect on July 1, 2011. The CTS provides for a Canadian Local Toll (CLT) for deliveries within western Canada, which is based on the 2011 Incentive Tolling Settlement toll, as well as an International Joint Tariff (IJT) for crude oil shipments originating in western Canada on the Canadian Mainline and delivered into the United States, via the Lakehead System, and into eastern Canada. These tolls are denominated in United States dollars. The IJT is designed to provide shippers on the mainline system with a stable and competitive long-term toll, thereby preserving and enhancing throughput on both the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System. The CLT and the IJT were both established at the time of implementation of the CTS and are adjusted annually, on July 1 of each year, at a rate equal to 75% of the Canadian Gross Domestic Product at Market Price Index published by Statistics Canada.
Although the CTS has a 10-year term, it does not require shippers to commit to certain volumes. Shippers nominate volumes on a monthly basis and we allocate capacity to maximize the efficiency of the Canadian Mainline.
Local tolls for service on the Lakehead System are not affected by the CTS and continue to be established pursuant to the Lakehead System’s existing toll agreements, as described below. Under the terms of the IJT agreement, the Canadian Mainline’s share of the IJT relating to pipeline transportation of a batch from any western Canada receipt point to the United States border is equal to the IJT applicable to that batch’s United States delivery point less the Lakehead System’s local toll to that delivery point. This amount is referred to as the Canadian Mainline IJT Residual Benchmark Toll and is denominated in United States dollars.
12

Lakehead System Local Tolls
Transportation rates are governed by the FERC for deliveries from the Canada/United States border near Neche, North Dakota and from Clearbrook, Minnesota to certain principal delivery points. The Lakehead System periodically adjusts these transportation rates as allowed under the FERC’s index methodology and tariff agreements, the main components of which are index rates and the Facilities Surcharge Mechanism. Index rates, the base portion of the transportation rates for the Lakehead System, are subject to an annual adjustment which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the FERC. The Facilities Surcharge Mechanism allows the Lakehead System to recover costs associated with certain shipper-requested projects through an incremental surcharge in addition to the existing index rates, and is subject to annual adjustment on April 1.
REGIONAL OIL SANDS SYSTEM 
The Regional Oil Sands System includes five intra-Alberta long haul pipelines, the Athabasca Pipeline, Waupisoo Pipeline, Woodland Pipeline, Wood Buffalo Extension/Athabasca Twin pipeline system and the Norlite Pipeline System (Norlite), as well as two large terminals: the Athabasca Terminal located north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Cheecham Terminal, located south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System also includes numerous laterals and related facilities which provide access for oil sands production to the system, and a long-haul intra-Alberta pipeline that transports diluent from the Edmonton, Alberta region into the oil sands producing regions located north and south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Regional Oil Sands System currently serves twelve producing oil sands projects. 
The combined capacity of the intra-Alberta long haul pipelines is approximately 930,000 bpd to Edmonton and 1,370,000 bpd into Hardisty, with Norlite providing approximately 218,000 bpd of diluent capacity into the Fort McMurray region. The Woodland Pipeline and Norlite Pipeline System are joint ventures, 50/50 between us and Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties, and 70/30 with Keyera Corp. respectively. The Regional Oil Sands System is anchored by long-term agreements with multiple oil sands producers that include provisions for the recovery of some of the operating costs of this system.
GULF COAST AND MID-CONTINENT
Gulf Coast includes Seaway Crude Pipeline System (Seaway Pipeline), Flanagan South Pipeline (Flanagan South) and Spearhead Pipeline, as well as the Mid-Continent System comprised of the Cushing Terminal. 
Seaway Pipeline
In 2011, we acquired a 50% interest in the 1,078-kilometer (670-mile) Seaway Pipeline, including the 805-kilometer (500-mile), 30-inch diameter long-haul system between Cushing, Oklahoma and Freeport, Texas, as well as the Texas City Terminal and Distribution System which serve refineries in the Houston and Texas City areas. Seaway Pipeline also includes 8.8 million barrels of crude oil storage tank capacity on the Texas Gulf Coast. 
The flow direction of Seaway Pipeline was reversed in 2012, enabling it to transport crude from the oversupplied hub in Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. Further pump station additions and modifications were completed in early 2013, increasing capacity available to shippers from an initial 150,000 bpd to approximately 400,000 bpd, depending on crude slate. In late 2014, a second line, the Seaway Pipeline Twin, was placed into service to more than double the existing capacity to 850,000 bpd. Seaway Pipeline also includes a 161-kilometer (100-mile) pipeline from the Enterprise Crude Houston crude oil terminal in Houston, Texas to the Port Arthur/Beaumont, Texas refining center. 
Flanagan South Pipeline
Flanagan South is a 950-kilometer (590-mile), 36-inch diameter interstate crude oil pipeline that originates at our terminal at Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, and terminates in Cushing, Oklahoma. Flanagan South and associated pumping stations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Flanagan South has an initial design capacity of approximately 600,000 bpd.
13

Spearhead Pipeline
Spearhead Pipeline is a long-haul pipeline that delivers crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, a delivery point on the Lakehead System, to Cushing, Oklahoma. The Spearhead pipeline was originally placed into service in 2006 and has a capacity of 193,000 bpd.
Mid-Continent System 
The Mid-Continent System is comprised of storage terminals at Cushing, Oklahoma (Cushing Terminal), consisting of over 80 individual storage tanks ranging in size from 78,000 to 570,000 barrels. Total storage shell capacity of Cushing Terminal is approximately 20 million barrels. A portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes, while the remainder is contracted to various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements. Contract fees include fixed monthly storage fees, throughput fees for receiving and delivering crude to and from connecting pipelines and terminals, and blending fees.
SOUTHERN LIGHTS PIPELINE
Southern Lights Pipeline is a single stream pipeline that ships diluent from the Manhattan Terminal near Chicago, Illinois to three western Canadian delivery facilities, located at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals in Alberta and the Kerrobert terminal in Saskatchewan. This 180,000 bpd 16/18/20-inch diameter pipeline was placed into service in 2010. Both the Canadian portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights Canada) and the United States portion of Southern Lights Pipeline (Southern Lights US) receive tariff revenues under long-term contracts with committed shippers. Southern Lights Pipeline capacity is 90% contracted with the remaining 10% of the capacity (18,000 bpd) assigned for shippers to ship uncommitted volumes.
EXPRESS-PLATTE SYSTEM
The Express-Platte system is comprised of both the Express pipeline and the Platte pipeline, and crude oil storage of approximately 5.6 million barrels. It is an approximate 2,736-kilometer (1,700-mile) crude oil transportation system, which begins in Hardisty, Alberta, and terminates in Wood River, Illinois. The Express pipeline carries crude oil to United States refining markets in the Rocky Mountains area, including Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. The Platte pipeline, which interconnects with the Express pipeline in Casper, Wyoming, transports crude oil predominantly from the Bakken shale and western Canada to refineries in the Midwest. Express pipeline capacity is typically committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers. A small portion of Express pipeline capacity and all of the Platte pipeline capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who pay only for the pipeline capacity they actually use in a given month.
BAKKEN SYSTEM
The Bakken System consists of the North Dakota System and the Bakken Pipeline System. The North Dakota System services the Bakken in North Dakota, and is comprised of a crude oil gathering and interstate pipeline transportation system. The gathering system provides delivery to Clearbrook for service on the Lakehead system or a variety of interconnecting pipeline and rail export facilities. The interstate portion of the system has both U.S. and Canadian components that extend from Berthold, North Dakota into Cromer, Manitoba.
Tariffs on the United States portion of the North Dakota System are governed by the FERC and include a local tariff. The Canadian portion is categorized as a Group 2 pipeline, and as such, its tolls are regulated by the NEB on a complaint basis. Tolls on the interstate pipeline system are based on long-term take-or-pay agreements with anchor shippers.
In February 2017, we closed a transaction to acquire an effective 27.6% interest in the Bakken Pipeline System, which connects the Bakken formation in North Dakota to markets in eastern PADD II and the United States Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline System consists of the Dakota Access Pipeline from the Bakken area in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka, 
14

Illinois to Nederland, Texas. Initial capacity is in excess of 500,000 bpd of crude oil with the potential to be expanded through additional pumping horsepower. The Bakken Pipeline System is anchored by long-term throughput commitments from a number of producers.
FEEDER PIPELINES AND OTHER
Feeder Pipelines and Other includes a number of liquids storage assets and pipeline systems in Canada and the United States. 
Key assets included in Feeder Pipelines and Other are the Hardisty Contract Terminal and Hardisty Storage Caverns located near Hardisty, Alberta, a key crude oil pipeline hub in western Canada and the Southern Access Extension (SAX) pipeline which originates out of Flanagan, Illinois and delivers to Patoka, Illinois. On July 1, 2014, Marathon executed an agreement with us to become an owner (35%) in SAX, thereby forming the Illinois Extension Pipeline Company (IEPC). We have a 65% ownership in IEPC. SAX was placed into service in December 2015 with the majority of its capacity commercially secured under long-term take-or-pay contracts with shippers.
Feeder Pipelines and Other also includes Patoka Storage, the Toledo pipeline system and the Norman Wells (NW) System. Patoka Storage is comprised of four storage tanks with 480,000 barrels of shell capacity located in Patoka, Illinois. The Toledo pipeline system connects with the Lakehead System and delivers to Ohio and Michigan. The NW System transports crude oil from Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta and has a cost of service rate structure based on established terms with shippers.
COMPETITION
Other competing carriers available to ship western Canadian liquid hydrocarbons to markets in Canada, the United States and internationally represent competition to our liquids pipelines network. Competition amongst existing pipelines is based primarily on the cost of transportation, access to supply, the quality and reliability of service, contract carrier alternatives and proximity to markets.

Competition also arises from proposed pipelines that seek to access markets currently served by our liquids pipelines, such as proposed projects to the Gulf Coast and from proposed projects enhancing infrastructure in the Alberta regional oil sands market. The Mid-Continent and Bakken systems also face competition from existing pipelines, proposed future pipelines and existing and alternative gathering facilities. Competition for storage facilities in the United States includes large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships. Additionally, volatile crude price differentials and insufficient pipeline capacity on either our or competitors' pipelines can make transportation of crude oil by rail competitive, particularly to markets not currently serviced by pipelines.

We believe that our liquids pipelines continue to provide attractive options to producers in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) and North Dakota due to our competitive tolls and flexibility through our multiple delivery and storage points. We also employ long-term agreements with shippers, which mitigates competition risk by ensuring consistent supply to our liquids pipelines network. Our current complement of growth projects to expand market access and to enhance capacity on our pipeline system are expected to provide shippers reliable and long-term competitive solutions for liquids transportation. We have a proven track record of successfully executing projects to meet the needs of our customers and our existing right-of-way for the mainline system also provides a competitive advantage as it can be difficult and costly to obtain rights-of-way for new pipelines traversing new areas.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
We have an established and successful history of being the largest transporter of crude oil to the United States, the world’s largest market for crude oil. While United States demand for Canadian crude oil production will support the use of our infrastructure for the foreseeable future, North American and global crude oil supply and demand fundamentals are shifting, and we have a role to play in this transition by 
15

developing long-term transportation options that enable the efficient flow of crude oil from supply regions to end-user markets.
Higher prices in the early part of this decade encouraged production development which pushed supply beyond demand resulting in an extended price downturn starting in 2014. By the second half of 2016, drilling technology efficiencies and innovations in North America reinvigorated production growth. Oil prices continued to strengthen into 2018 on supply concerns created by sanctions being imposed on Iran; prompting Saudi Arabia and Russia to abandon rationing targets therefore reducing earlier price gains. At the same time, global demand softened in the wake of an escalating United States-China trade dispute. This resulted in the return to crude inventory builds globally. 
In Western Canada, lack of export pipeline capacity resulted in the rapid buildup of inventories and extreme discounts of Western Canadian crude; WCS discounts peaked at over US$50 per barrel against WTI in October. This, in turn, resulted in the Alberta Government entering into negotiations to purchase 7,000 rail cars and 80 engines to add about 120,000 bpd of rail export capacity for the industry by the end of 2020, and the adoption of a production curtailment policy directing the industry in the province to shut in 325,000 bpd starting January 1, 2019. The aim of this policy is to both draw down inventories by approximately 20 million barrels and return crude discounts to more historical norms. The policy calls for curtailment levels to be reduced as inventory levels ratchet down and new pipeline and rail capacity come on line. Western Canadian crude prices responded almost immediately upon the release of the curtailment adoption notice, with discounts narrowing to around US$10 per barrel. The discount at this level would imply that rail is not financially attractive, and hence frustrating the government's efforts to draw down inventories. 
Notwithstanding the current price environment and Alberta policies, our mainline system has thus far continued to be highly utilized. Mainline throughput as measured at the Canada/United States border at Gretna, Manitoba saw record deliveries of 2.8 million bpd in November 2018. The mainline system continues to be subject to apportionment, as nominated volumes currently exceed capacity on portions of the system. The impact of a low crude oil price environment on the financial performance of our liquids pipelines business is expected to be relatively modest given the cost effectiveness of our mainline toll, and commercial arrangements which underpin many of the pipelines providing a significant measure of protection against volume fluctuations. Our mainline system is well positioned to continue to provide safe and efficient transportation which will enable western Canadian and Bakken production to reach attractive markets in the United States and eastern Canada at a competitive cost relative to other alternatives.
The fundamentals of oil sands production and steep discounts for Western Canadian crude have caused some sponsors to reconsider the timing of future projects. While recently updated forecasts continue to reflect long-term supply growth from the WCSB, the projected pace of growth is slower than previous forecasts as companies continue to assess the viability of capital investments in light of the current price environment and ongoing uncertainty with respect to the timing and completion of new pipeline systems proposed by our competitors.
Over the long term, continued growth in global energy consumption is expected to be primarily driven by emerging economies in regions outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), mainly in India and China. In North America, demand growth for transportation fuels is expected to moderate due to vehicle fuel efficiencies and increasing sales of electric vehicles. Accordingly, there is a strategic opportunity to establish tide-water export facilities to service North American producers wanting access to global markets.
Global crude oil production is expected to continue to grow through 2035, primarily by North America, Brazil and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Growth in supply from OPEC is partly due to the expected recovery of Iraqi and Libyan production. Over the longer term, North American production from tight oil plays is expected to grow as technology continues to improve well productivity and efficiencies. The pace of growth in North America and level of investment in the WCSB could be 
16

tempered in future years by a number of factors including a sustained period of low crude oil prices and corresponding production decisions by OPEC, increasing environmental regulation, and prolonged approval processes for new pipelines with access to tide-water for export or to United States markets.
In recent years, the combination of relatively flat domestic demand, growing supply and long-lead time to build pipeline infrastructure led to a fundamental change in the North American crude oil landscape. The inability to move increasing inland supply to markets resulted in a divergence between WTI and world pricing, resulting in lower netbacks for North American producers. The impact of price differentials has been even more pronounced for western Canadian producers as insufficient pipeline infrastructure resulted in a further discounting of Alberta crude relative to WTI. New pipeline capacity is expected to come online in 2019, further stabilizing differentials in western Canada and the end to the government curtailment program. Canadian pipeline export capacity is expected to remain fully utilized, resulting in continued apportionment on our mainline system and incremental production utilizing non-pipeline transportation services (e.g. rail and trucks) until such time as sufficient pipeline capacity is made available. Over the longer term, however, we believe pipelines will continue to be the most reliable and cost-effective means of transportation.
Our role in helping to address the evolving supply and demand fundamentals and alleviating price discounts for producers and supply costs to refiners is through optimization of throughput on our existing liquids pipelines systems and through investment in new pipelines and related infrastructure to provide expanded transportation capacity and sustainable connectivity to alternative markets. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7.

US Gas Transmission includes ownership interests in Texas Eastern, Algonquin, M&N U.S., East Tennessee, Gulfstream, Sabal Trail, NEXUS, Valley Crossing, Southeast Supply Header (SESH), Vector Pipeline L.P. (Vector) and certain other gas pipeline and storage assets. The US Gas Transmission business primarily provides transmission and storage of natural gas through interstate pipeline systems for customers in various regions of the northeastern, southern and midwestern United States.
The Texas Eastern natural gas transmission system extends approximately 2,735-kilometers (1,700-miles) from producing fields in the Gulf Coast region of Texas and Louisiana to Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Texas Eastern's onshore system consists of approximately 14,597-kilometers (9,070-miles) of pipeline and associated compressor stations. Texas Eastern is also connected to four affiliated storage facilities that are partially or wholly-owned by other entities within the US Gas Transmission business.
The Algonquin natural gas transmission system connects with Texas Eastern’s facilities in New Jersey and extends approximately 402-kilometers (250-miles) through New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts where it connects to M&N U.S. The system consists of approximately 1,835-kilometers (1,140-miles) of pipeline with associated compressor stations. We indirectly own 92% of the Algonquin natural gas transmission system.
M&N U.S. is an approximately 563-kilometer (350-mile) mainline interstate natural gas transmission system, including associated compressor stations, which extends from northeastern Massachusetts to the border of Canada near Baileyville, Maine. M&N U.S. is connected to the Canadian portion of the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline system, M&N Canada (see Gas Transmission and Midstream - Canadian Gas Transmission and Midstream). We indirectly own 78% of M&N U.S.
East Tennessee’s natural gas transmission system crosses Texas Eastern’s system at two locations in Tennessee and consists of two mainline systems totaling approximately 2,470-kilometers (1,535-miles) of pipeline in Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, with associated compressor stations. East Tennessee has a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage facility in Tennessee and also connects to the Saltville storage facilities in Virginia.
Gulfstream is an approximately 1,199-kilometer (745-mile) interstate natural gas transmission system with associated compressor stations, operated jointly with The Williams Companies, Inc. Gulfstream transports natural gas from Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, crossing the Gulf of Mexico to markets in central and southern Florida. We indirectly own 50% of Gulfstream.
Sabal Trail is an approximately 829-kilometer (515-mile) pipeline that provides firm natural gas transportation to Florida Power & Light Company for its power generation needs and will deliver natural gas to Duke Energy Florida's natural gas plant. Facilities include a pipeline, laterals and various compressor stations. The pipeline infrastructure is located in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, and adds approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of new capacity enabling the access of onshore shale gas supplies once approved future expansions are completed. We indirectly own 50% of Sabal Trail.
NEXUS, which was placed into service in October 2018, is an approximately 410-kilometer (255-mile) interstate natural gas transmission system with associated compressor stations. NEXUS transports natural gas from our Texas Eastern system in Ohio to our Vector interstate pipeline in Michigan, and adds approximately 1.5 bcf/d of new capacity.

These pipelines are located in four major corridors in the Gulf of Mexico, extending to deepwater developments, and include almost 2,100-kilometers (1,300-miles) of underwater pipe and onshore facilities with total capacity of approximately 6.5 bcf/d.
COMPETITION
Our natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The flow pattern of natural gas is changing across North America due to emerging supply sources and evolving demand centers, which 
21

creates competition for growth opportunities. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.
The natural gas transported in our business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane, fuel oils, and renewable energy. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.
Competition exists in all of the markets our businesses serve. Competitors include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that transport, gather, treat, process and market natural gas or NGLs. Because pipelines are generally the most efficient mode of transportation for natural gas over land, the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipeline companies.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
Our gas transmission assets make up one of the largest natural gas transportation networks in North America, driving connectivity between prolific supply basins and major demand centers within the continent. Our systems have been integral to the transition in natural gas fundamentals over the last decade, and will continue to play a part as the energy landscape evolves. Shifts in production and consumption, both domestic and foreign, will require that we continue to serve as a critical link between markets.
At the close of the last decade, natural gas production in each of the Appalachian and Permian basins was less than 5.0 bcf/d each. Today, these regions produce more than 40.0 bcf/d of natural gas on a combined basis. Improved technology and increased shale gas drilling has increased the supply of low cost natural gas. As well, there has been and continues to be a corresponding increase in demand for our natural gas infrastructure in North America. Through a series of expansions and reversals on our core systems, combined with the execution of greenfield projects and strategic acquisitions, we have been able to meet the needs of producers and consumers alike. Our United States Gas Transmission systems were initially designed to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast to the supply starved northeast markets. Our asset base now has the capability to transport diverse supply to the northeast, southeast, midwest, and gulf coast markets on a fully subscribed and highly utilized basis.
The northeast market continues its role as a predominantly supply constrained region with steady growth. Natural gas demand in the northeast is expected to grow by 3.1 bcf/d through 2035, driven by continued commercial and residential load growth. Natural gas leads the fuel mix of the Independent System Operator New England market at more than 40 percent. The bidirectional capabilities offered by our system allow us to deliver both domestic and imported supplies to our regional customers, 75 percent of whom are local distribution companies with a contract renewal rate of 98 percent. The region has seen an increase in natural gas supply due to the development of the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachia region.
Demand for natural gas in the southeast region is forecast to increase by 3.5 bcf/d through 2035. Generating capacity in Florida is expected to grow 15 percent by 2026, the majority of which is projected to be natural gas-fired. The Southeast market is linked to multiple, highly liquid supply pools that include the Marcellus and Utica shale developments, offering consistent supply and stable pricing to a growing population of end-use customers across our multiple systems under long term, utility-like arrangements.
With connectivity to Appalachian and western Canadian supply through our systems, the midwest market has access to two of the lowest cost gas producing regions on the continent. As demand in the region continues to grow by approximately 3.0 bcf/d over the next two decades, maintaining this link will remain important. Flexibility in supply for this market is especially critical to maintaining liquidity and price stability as natural gas continues to replace coal fired generation.
22

Gulf coast demand growth is being driven by an ongoing wave of gas-intensive petrochemical facilities which are now starting to enter service, along with power generation, an increase in the volume of LNG exports and additional pipeline exports to Mexico. Demand in the region is anticipated to grow by more than 6.0 bcf/d through 2035. The Gulf coast market has been the beneficiary of low cost capacity on our assets as the relationship between supply and market centers has shifted. Such cost effective capacity is difficult to access or replicate, offering existing shippers and transporters stability of capacity and utilization. Tide water market access and proximity to Mexico continue to make this region a platform of global trade as pipeline, LNG and LPG exports see strong growth. The United States exported approximately 3.0 bcf/d of natural gas from the gulf coast region at the end of 2018 with an export capacity of approximately 10.0 bcf/d scheduled to be in service by 2021.
Despite there being strong growth in both supply and demand in the United States, a lack of adequate transportation capacity has placed downward pressure on local natural gas pricing. The Appalachian Basin has seen price differentials of $1.00 to $2.00 per MMBtu relative to Henry Hub in the gulf coast over the last few years. As 3.0 bcf/d of new capacity out of the region came online in late 2018, half of which is on our newly constructed assets, the differential between northeast production and downstream markets has significantly strengthened. Unlike the dry gas production of the Marcellus, natural gas production growth in the Permian Basin is a result of robust crude oil production taking place in the region. Associated gas supplies from the region increased by approximately 4.0 bcf/d over the past two years and growth is forecasted to continue for the next decade. Until new natural gas transportation capacity begins to come online in the second half of 2019, the natural gas prices in the region will continue to remain low relative to other producing regions.
Western Canada is experiencing a similar phenomenon to that of the Permian, with the local markets experiencing very low or even negative prices for natural gas, as transportation bottlenecks continue. One of the few vital links to demand centers in the pacific northwest are our own systems in the region which operate near full capacity. As demand for supply out of the WCSB continues to grow, driven largely by NGL production and local oil sands production, the need for new natural gas and NGL infrastructure will continue to rise. 
Global energy demand is expected to increase approximately 30 percent by 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, driven primarily by economic growth in non-OECD countries. Natural gas will play an important role in meeting this energy demand as gas consumption is anticipated to grow by approximately 45 percent during this period as one of the world’s fastest growing energy sources. North American exports will play a significant part in meeting global demand, underscoring the ability of our assets to remain highly utilized by shippers, and highlighting the need for incremental transportation solutions across North America. In response to these global fundamentals, we believe we are well positioned to provide value-added solutions to shippers. We are responding to the need for regional infrastructure with additional investments in Canadian and United States gas transportation facilities. Progress on the development and construction of our commercially secured growth projects is discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Growth Projects - Commercially Secured Projects.
GAS DISTRIBUTION
Gas Distribution consists of our natural gas utility operations, the core of which are EGD and Union Gas, which serve residential, commercial and industrial customers, primarily located throughout Ontario. This business segment also includes natural gas distribution activities in Quebec and New Brunswick and an investment in Noverco Inc (Noverco).
On August 30, 2018, we received a decision from the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) approving the application to amalgamate EGD and Union Gas (Amalgamation). On October 15, 2018, we announced that we would proceed with the Amalgamation, with an expected effective date of January 1, 2019. On 
23

January 1, 2019, the Amalgamation was completed and the amalgamated company continued as Enbridge Gas Inc.
The OEB decision also approved the rate setting mechanism for the amalgamated entity to be employed during a five-year deferred rebasing period from 2019 through 2023, after which time rates will be rebased. The decision also approved the continuation and establishment of certain deferral and variance accounts, as well as an earnings sharing mechanism that requires the amalgamated entity to share equally with customers, any earnings in excess of 150 basis points over the OEB approved return on equity (ROE).
The Amalgamation, on January 1, 2019, created the single largest natural gas utility in North America in terms of send-out volumes, and third largest in terms of number of customers. We expect that this will drive efficiencies and synergies, leverage greater supply-chain strength, create new opportunities for growth, and form a stronger platform to deliver strong, predictable returns to shareholders and superior value and service to customers.
Given the timing of the Amalgamation, this Annual Report on Form 10-K continues to provide separate descriptions of EGD and Union Gas and separate discussions of the operating and financial performance of each of those entities for the year ended December 31, 2018. Post-Amalgamation, the management and operations of EGD and Union Gas will become integrated and the operating and financial results of Enbridge Gas Inc. will reflect the combined performance of the two legacy utility operations.
ENBRIDGE GAS DISTRIBUTION
EGD is a rate-regulated natural gas distribution utility serving approximately 2.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of central and eastern Ontario. In addition, EGD currently serves areas in northern New York State through St. Lawrence Gas Company Inc. (St. Lawrence Gas). In August 2017, EGD entered into an agreement to sell the issued and outstanding shares of St. Lawrence Gas. The transaction is expected to close in 2019, subject to regulatory approval and certain pre-closing conditions.
EGD also owns and operates regulated and unregulated natural gas storage facilities in Ontario. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal bylaws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of EGD and St. Lawrence Gas are regulated by the OEB and by the New York State Public Service Commission, respectively.
24

As at December 31, 2018, EGD owned and operated a network of approximately 83,000-kilometers (51,574-miles) of mains for the distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.
There are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which EGD is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.
Distribution 
EGD's principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are usually on an annual contract basis under firm or interruptible service contracts.
Transportation
EGD relies on its long-term contracts with Union Gas, an affiliated company under common control, for transportation of natural gas from Dawn. These contracts effectively provide EGD with access to United States sourced natural gas at Dawn. These contracts also provide transportation for natural gas received at Dawn via Vector as well as natural gas stored at EGD's and Union Gas' storage pools. Key pipeline interconnects enabled EGD to deliver approximately 449 bcf of gas through EGD's distribution and transmission system in 2018. 
In addition, EGD contracts for firm transportation service with TransCanada Corporation (TransCanada) to meet its annual natural gas supply requirements. The transportation service contracts are not directly linked with any particular source of natural gas supply. Separating transportation contracts from natural gas supply allows EGD flexibility in obtaining its customer's natural gas supply and accommodating the requests of its direct purchase customers for assignment of TransCanada capacity. EGD forecasts the natural gas supply needs of its customers, including the associated transportation and storage requirements.
Storage
EGD’s business is highly seasonal as daily market demand for natural gas fluctuates with changes in weather, with peak consumption occurring in the winter months. Utilization of storage facilities permits EGD to take delivery of natural gas on favorable terms during off‑peak summer periods for subsequent use during the winter heating season. This practice permits EGD to minimize the annual cost of transportation of natural gas from its supply basins, assists in reducing its overall cost of natural gas supply and adds a measure of security in the event of any short-term interruption of transportation of natural gas to EGD's franchise area. EGD's principal storage facilities are located in southwestern Ontario, near Dawn, and have a total working capacity of approximately 109 bcf in 11 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. 99 petajoules (PJs) of the total working capacity is available to EGD for utility operations. EGD also has storage contracts with third parties for 6 bcf of storage capacity.
UNION GAS
Union Gas is a rate‑regulated natural gas distribution utility that currently serves approximately 1.5 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in its franchise areas of northern, southwestern and eastern Ontario.
Union Gas' regulated and unregulated storage and transmission business offers storage and transmission services to customers at Dawn. It offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canada and United States supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeastern United States. The utility business is conducted under statutes and municipal by‑laws which grant the right to operate in the areas served. The utility operations of Union Gas are regulated by the OEB.
25

As at December 31, 2018, Union Gas owned and operated a network of approximately 67,000-kilometers (41,632-miles) of mains for the transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the service pipes to transfer natural gas from mains to meters on customers' premises.
Similar to EGD, there are three principal interrelated aspects of the natural gas distribution business in which Union Gas is directly involved: Distribution, Transportation and Storage.
Distribution 
Union Gas’ principal source of revenue arises from distribution of natural gas to customers. The services provided to residential, small commercial and industrial heating customers are primarily on a general service basis (without a specific fixed term or fixed price contract). The services provided to larger commercial and industrial customers are underpinned by firm or interruptible service contracts.
Transportation 
Union Gas’ transmission system consists of approximately 5,000-kilometers (3,107-miles) of high-pressure pipeline and five mainline compressor stations. Key pipeline interconnects in Canada and the United States enabled Union Gas to deliver approximately 1,372 bcf of gas through Union Gas’ distribution and transmission system in 2018. Union Gas’ transmission system also links an extensive network of underground storage pools at Dawn to major Canadian and United States markets. There are multiple pipelines providing access to Dawn. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible transportation services on the Union Gas system. As the supply of natural gas in areas close to Ontario continues to grow, there is an increased demand to access these diverse supplies at Dawn and transport them along the Dawn-Parkway pipeline system to markets in Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. As of November 1, 2017, the transmission system has an effective peak daily demand capacity of 7.5 bcf/d. A substantial amount of Union Gas’ transportation revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately 11 years, with the longest remaining contract term being 15 years.
Storage
Union Gas’ underground natural gas storage facilities have a working capacity of approximately 167 bcf in 25 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. 100 PJs of the total working capacity is available to Union Gas for utility operations. Union Gas also has storage contracts with third parties for 11 bcf of storage capacity. Union Gas’ storage pools give customers access to all Dawn storage capacity and deliverability. Dawn's configuration provides flexibility for injections, withdrawals and cycling. Customers can purchase both firm and interruptible storage services at Dawn. Dawn offers customers a wide range of market choices and options with easy access to upstream and downstream markets. During 2018, Dawn provided storage, balancing, gas loans, transport, exchange and peaking services to over 195 counterparties.
A substantial amount of Union Gas’ storage revenue is generated by fixed annual demand charges, with the average length of a long-term contract being approximately four years, with the longest remaining contract term being 18 years.
NOVERCO
Noverco is a holding company that owns approximately 71% of Energir LP (Energir), formerly known as Gaz Metro Limited Partnership, a natural gas distribution company operating in the province of Quebec with interests in subsidiary companies operating gas transmission, gas distribution and power distribution businesses in the Province of Quebec and the State of Vermont. Energir serves approximately 520,000 residential and industrial customers and is regulated by the Quebec Régie de l’énergie and the Vermont Public Utility Commission. Noverco also holds, directly and indirectly, an investment in our common shares. We own an equity interest in Noverco through ownership of 38.9% of its common shares and an investment in its preferred shares. 
OTHER GAS DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE
26

Other Gas Distribution and Storage includes natural gas distribution utility operations in the Provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec.
Enbridge Gas New Brunswick Inc. operates the natural gas distribution franchise in the Province of New Brunswick, has approximately 12,000 customers and is regulated by the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board (NBEUB). On December 4, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement for the sale of Enbridge Gas New Brunswick Inc. Closing of the transaction remains subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to occur in 2019. For further information, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset Monetization.
We also wholly own Gazifère, a natural gas distribution company that serves approximately 40,000 customers in western Quebec, a market not served by Energir. Gazifère is regulated by the Quebec Régie de l’énergie.
COMPETITON
EGD and Union Gas’ distribution systems are regulated by the OEB and are subject to regulation in a number of areas, including rates. EGD and Union Gas are not generally subject to third-party competition within their distribution franchise area. 
EGD and Union Gas compete with other forms of energy available to their customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors. 
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
We expect that demand for natural gas in North America will continue to see low annual growth over the long term with continued growth in peak day demands. Some modest growth driven by low natural gas prices is expected to continue given the significant price advantage relative to their alternate energy options, with specific interest coming from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas. EGD and Union Gas continue to focus on promoting conservation and energy efficiency by undertaking activities focused on reducing natural gas consumption through various demand side management programs offered across all markets.
The storage and transportation marketplace continues to respond to changing natural gas supply dynamics including a robust supply environment. In recent years, the robust North American gas supply balance, due mainly to the development of shale gas volumes including the Alberta, British Columbia, Marcellus and Utica shale areas, has resulted in lower commodity prices and narrower seasonal price spreads. Unregulated storage values are primarily determined based on the difference in value between winter and summer natural gas prices. Storage values have been relatively stable to slightly rising as the North American natural gas supply and demand slowly returned to a more balanced position.
GREEN POWER & TRANSMISSION
Green Power and Transmission consists of investments in renewable energy assets and transmission facilities. Renewable energy assets consist of wind, solar, geothermal and waste heat recovery facilities and are located in Canada primarily in the provinces of Alberta, Ontario and Quebec and in the United States primarily in the states of Colorado, Texas, Indiana and West Virginia. Green Power and Transmission also includes offshore wind facilities in operation and under development located in Europe.
27

28

Green Power and Transmission includes interests in more than 1,700 MW of net renewable power generation capacity. Of this amount, approximately 477 MW is generated by wind facilities located in Canada, approximately 912 MW is generated by wind facilities located in the United States, approximately 100 MW is derived from a 24.9% interest in the 400 MW Rampion Offshore Wind Project and approximately 155 MW is derived from a 25% interest in the Hohe See Offshore wind power project and its subsequent expansion, both currently under construction. The vast majority of the power produced from these wind facilities is sold under long-term power purchase agreements. Green Power and Transmission also includes three solar facilities located in Ontario and a solar facility located in Nevada, with 51 MW and 27 MW, respectively, of power generating capacity net of our partners’ interests. 
Green Power and Transmission also includes the Montana-Alberta Tie-Line, a 300 MW transmission line from Great Falls, Montana to Lethbridge, Alberta.
On August 1, 2018, we closed the sale of a 49% interest in all of our Canadian renewable assets, a 49% interest in two United States renewable assets and 49% of our interest in the Hohe See Offshore wind power project and its subsequent expansion, both currently under construction in Germany (collectively, the Renewable Assets). We maintain a 51% interest in the Renewable Assets and will continue to manage, operate and provide administrative services for these assets. For further information, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset Monetization.
COMPETITION
Our Green Power and Transmission assets operate in the North American and European power markets, which are subject to competition and the supply and demand balance for power in the provinces and states in which they operate. The vast majority of the revenue generated by currently operating assets is generated pursuant to long term power purchase agreements or has been substantially hedged. As such, the financial performance of these assets is not significantly impacted by fluctuating power prices arising from supply/demand imbalances or the actions of competing facilities during the term of the applicable contracts. However, the renewable energy market sector includes large utilities and small independent power producers, which are expected to aggressively compete for new project development opportunities and for the right to supply customers when contracts roll off.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND
The power generation and transmission network in North America is expected to undergo significant growth over the next 20 years. On the demand side, North American economic growth over the longer term is expected to drive growing electricity demand, although continued efficiency gains are expected to make the economy less energy-intensive and temper demand growth. On the supply side, legislation in Canada is expected to accelerate the retirement of aging coal-fired generation plants, resulting in a requirement for significant new generation capacity. While coal and nuclear facilities will continue to be core components of power generation in North America, gas-fired and renewable energy facilities, including biomass, hydro, solar and wind, are expected to be the preferred sources to replace coal-fired generation due to their lower carbon intensities.

In the United States, there is over 85 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind power capacity and in Canada over 12 GW of installed wind power capacity. Solar resources in southwestern states such as Arizona, California and Nevada are considered to be some of the best in the world for large-scale solar plants and the United States currently has over 35 GW of installed solar photovoltaic capacity. The United States passed legislation extending the availability of certain federal tax incentives which have supported the profitability of wind and solar projects. However, expanding renewable energy infrastructure in North America is not without challenges. Growing renewable generation capacity is expected to necessitate substantial capital investment to upgrade existing transmission systems or, in many cases, build new transmission lines, as these high quality wind and solar resources are often found in regions that are not 
29

in close proximity to markets. In the near-term, uncertainty over the availability of tax or other government incentives in various jurisdictions, the ability to secure long-term power purchase agreements through government or investor-owned power authorities and low market prices of electricity may hinder the pace of future new renewable capacity development. However, continued improvement in technology and manufacturing capacity in the past few years has reduced capital costs and improved yield factors associated with renewable energy generation. These positive developments are expected to render renewable energy more competitive and support ongoing investment over the long term. 

In Europe, the future outlook for renewable energy, especially from offshore wind in countries with long coastlines and densely populated areas, is positive. According to the European Wind Energy Association, by 2030, wind energy capacity in Europe is expected to be 320 GW, including 66 GW of offshore capacity. There is also wide public support for carbon reduction targets and broader adoption of renewable generation across all governmental levels. Furthermore, governments in Europe are seeking to rationalize the contribution of nuclear power to the overall energy mix, which has resulted in an increased focus on alternative sources such as large scale offshore wind and is expected to create further investment opportunities.
ENERGY SERVICES
The Energy Services businesses in Canada and the United States undertake physical commodity marketing activity and logistical services, and manage our volume commitments on various pipeline systems. Energy Services provides energy marketing services to North American refiners, producers and other customers.
Through wholly-owned marketing subsidiaries, Energy Services provides crude oil, natural gas, NGL and power marketing services. Energy Services transact at many North American market hubs and provide our customers with various services, including transportation, storage, supply management and product exchanges. Our Energy Services subsidiaries are primarily physical commodity marketing companies focused on servicing customers across the value chain and capturing value from quality, time and location price differentials when opportunities arise. To execute these strategies, Energy Services transports and stores on both Enbridge-owned and third party assets using a combination of contracted long-term and short-term pipeline, storage tank, rail car and truck capacity agreements. 
COMPETITION
Energy Services earnings are primarily generated from arbitrage opportunities which, by their nature, can be replicated by competitors. An increase in market participants entering into similar arbitrage strategies could have an impact on our earnings. Efforts to mitigate competition risk include diversification of the marketing business by transacting at the majority of major hubs in North America and establishing long-term relationships with clients and pipelines.
ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER
Eliminations and Other includes operating and administrative costs and the impact of foreign exchange hedge settlements, which are not allocated to business segments. Eliminations and Other also includes new business development activities and corporate investments.
OPERATIONAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC REGULATION
LIQUIDS PIPELINES
Operational Regulation
30

We are subject to numerous operational rules and regulations mandated by governments or applicable regulatory authorities, breaches of which could result in fines, penalties, operating restrictions and an overall increase in operating and compliance costs. 
In the United States, our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines. These laws and regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The regulations determine the pressures at which our pipelines can operate.
PHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. Additionally, PHMSA has established standards for storage facilities. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failure or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
In Canada, our pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations overseen by the NEB or provincial regulators. Applicable legislation and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. Among other obligations, this regulatory framework imposes requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. 
As in the United States, several legislative changes addressing pipeline safety in Canada have recently been enacted. The changes evidence an increased focus on the implementation of management systems to address key areas such as emergency management, integrity management, safety, security and environmental protection. Other legislative changes have created authority for the NEB to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance with the regulatory regime it administers, as well as to impose financial requirements for future abandonment and major pipeline releases. 
Environmental Regulation
We are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits and other approvals. 
In particular, in the United States, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs is likely to cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance. Some states in which we operate are implementing new emissions limits to comply with 2008 ozone standards regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In 2015, the ozone standards were lowered even further from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb, which may require states to implement additional emissions regulations. The precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes. In addition, compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs may significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels.
In the United States, climate change action is evolving at state, regional and federal levels. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 established that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Pursuant to federal 
31

regulations, we are currently subject to an obligation to report our GHG emissions at our largest emitting facilities, but are not generally subject to limits on emissions of GHGs. In addition, a number of states have joined regional GHG initiatives, and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in GHG emissions. Public interest groups and regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on the emission of methane associated with natural gas development and transmission as a source of GHG emissions. However, as the key details of future GHG restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined, the likely future effects on our business are highly uncertain. 
For its part, Canada has reaffirmed its strong preference for a harmonized approach with that of the United States. The Government of Canada has recently released the details of a federal system of carbon pricing starting in 2019. The pricing will apply to provinces and territories that are not in compliance with the federal requirements.
Due to the speculative outlook regarding any United States federal and state policies, we cannot estimate the potential effect of proposed GHG policies on our future consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, such legislation or regulation could materially increase our operating costs, require material capital expenditures or create additional permitting, which could delay proposed construction projects. 
Economic Regulation
Our liquids pipelines also face economic regulation risk. Broadly defined, economic regulation risk is the risk that governments or regulatory agencies change or reject proposed or existing commercial arrangements including permits and regulatory approvals for new projects. The Canadian Mainline, Lakehead System and other liquids pipelines are subject to the actions of various regulators, including the NEB and FERC, with respect to the tariffs and tolls of those operations. The changing or rejecting of commercial arrangements, including decisions by regulators on the applicable tariff structure or changes in interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulators, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. Delays in regulatory approvals on projects such as our L3R Program, could result in cost escalations and construction delays, which also negatively impact our operations. 
GAS TRANSMISSION & MIDSTREAM
Operational Regulation
The span of regulation risks that apply to the Liquids Pipeline business as described above under Liquids Pipelines also applies to the Gas Transmission and Midstream business. Additionally, most of our United States gas transmission operations are regulated by the FERC. The FERC regulates natural gas transmission in United States interstate commerce including the establishment of rates for services. The FERC also regulates the construction of United States interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, including the extension, enlargement and abandonment of facilities. In addition, certain operations are subject to oversight by state regulatory commissions. To the extent that the natural gas intrastate pipelines that transport or store natural gas in interstate commerce provide services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, they are subject to FERC regulations. The FERC may propose and implement new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas transmission and storage companies, which remain subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect certain transmission of gas by intrastate pipelines.
Our operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and various other federal, state and local environmental agencies. Our United States interstate natural gas pipelines and certain of DCP Midstream’s gathering and transmission pipelines are also subject to the regulations of the DOT concerning pipeline safety.
The intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines owned by us and DCP Midstream are subject to state regulation. The natural gas gathering and processing activities of DCP Midstream are not subject to FERC regulation.
32

Our Canadian operations are governed by various federal and provincial agencies with respect to pipeline safety, including the NEB, the Transportation Safety Board and the Ontario Technical Standards and Safety Authority.
Our Canadian natural gas transmission and distribution operations and approximately two-thirds of the storage operations in Canada are subject to regulation by the NEB or the provincial agencies in Canada, such as the OEB. These agencies have jurisdiction similar to the FERC for regulating rates, the terms and conditions of service, the construction of additional facilities and acquisitions. Our British Columbia Pipeline currently has a two year Settlement Agreement with its Shippers that provides for cost sharing on certain controllable expenses and sets out the regulated ROE for the two year period. The Settlement Agreement has been approved by the NEB. 
Our British Columbia Field Services business in western Canada is regulated by the NEB pursuant to a framework for light-handed regulation under which the NEB acts on a complaints-basis for rates associated with that business.
GAS DISTRIBUTION
Operational Regulation
Our gas distribution utility operations are regulated by the OEB, the Quebec Régie de l’énergie and the NBEUB, among others. Regulators’ future actions may differ from current expectations, or future legislative changes may impact the regulatory environments in which we operate. To the extent that the regulators’ future actions are different from current expectations, the timing and amount of recovery or refund of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or that would have been recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in absence of the effects of regulation, could be different from the amounts that are eventually recovered or refunded.
We seek to mitigate operational regulation risk. We retain dedicated professional staff and maintain strong relationships with customers, intervenors and regulators. This strong regulatory relationship continued in 2018 with the OEB’s decision to approve of the application to amalgamate EGD and Union Gas in accordance with the OEB's guidance for Mergers, Acquisitions, Amalgamations and Divestitures. The decision approved a rate setting mechanism, effective January 1, 2019, to be employed during a five-year deferred rebasing period from 2019 through 2023, and allows us the opportunity to drive efficiencies and synergies.
Enbridge Gas Distribution
EGD’s distribution rates, beginning in 2014 through 2018, were set under a five-year customized incentive regulation (IR) plan.  The plan required EGD to update select items each year beginning in 2015 and through 2018, in order to establish final allowed revenues and rates. Under the customized IR plan, EGD shared equally with customers, earnings above the approved allowed ROE. EGD's after-tax ROE was 9.00% for 2018 and 8.78% for 2017.
Union Gas
Union Gas’ distribution rates, beginning in 2014 through 2018, were set under a five-year IR plan which established new rates at the beginning of each year through the use of a pricing formula, rather than through the examination of revenue and cost forecasts. The IR plan included an earnings sharing mechanism with customers that permitted Union Gas to fully retain the ROE from utility operations up to 9.93%, to retain 50% of any earnings between 9.93% and 10.93%, and to retain 10% of any earnings above 10.93%.
Environmental Regulation
Our workers, operations and facilities are subject to municipal, provincial and federal legislation which regulate the protection of the environment and the health and safety of workers. Environmental legislation primarily includes regulation of discharges to air, land and water; management and disposal of hazardous waste; and the assessment and management of contaminated sites.
33

Gas distribution system operation, as with any industrial operation, has the potential risk of abnormal or emergency conditions, or other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions in excess of permitted levels. These events could result in injuries to workers or the public, fines, orders or charges, adverse impacts to the environment in which we operate, and/or property damage. We could also incur future liability for environmental (soil and groundwater) contamination associated with past and present site activities.
In addition to gas distribution system operation, we also operate small oil and brine production and storage facilities in southwestern Ontario. Environmental risk associated with these facilities is the potential for unplanned releases. In the event of a release, remediation of the affected area would be required. There would also be potential for fines, orders or charges under environmental legislation, and potential third-party liability claims by any affected land owners.
The gas distribution system and our other operations must maintain a number of environmental approvals and permits from governmental authorities to operate. As a result, these assets and facilities are subject to periodic inspection. An Annual Written Summary Report is submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP), formerly the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change to demonstrate we are in good standing with our Environmental Compliance Approvals. Failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in operational interruptions, fines, and/or orders for additional pollution control technology or environmental mitigation. As environmental requirements and regulations become more stringent, the cost to maintain compliance and the time required to obtain approvals has increased.
On July 3, 2018, the Government of Ontario issued Ontario Regulation 386/18 (the “Regulation”) which revoked the Cap and Trade program regulation and prohibits registered participants from purchasing, selling, trading or otherwise dealing with emission allowances or credits. On July 25, 2018, the Government of Ontario introduced Bill 4 to wind down the Cap and Trade program. On October 31, 2018, Bill 4, Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018 (the “Act”) received Royal Assent. This Act detailed the wind down of the Ontario Cap and Trade program, effectively expunging any compliance obligation associated with greenhouse gas emissions. 
Additionally, in October 2018, the federal government confirmed that Ontario will be subject to the federal government’s carbon pricing program (otherwise known as the Federal Carbon Pricing Backstop Program) (the Program). EGD and Union Gas are in the process of updating already filed rate applications for the Program, based on recent regulation updates, with the OEB. We anticipate that all costs associated with the Program, including implementation and ongoing sustainment, will be considered a pass-through cost. 
As with previous years, in 2018, the EGD and Union Gas each reported GHG emissions to the Ontario MECP, and a number of voluntary reporting programs. Emissions from Ontario combustion sources were verified in detail by a third party accredited verifier with no material discrepancies found. Additionally, operational emissions from venting, fugitive and natural gas distribution emissions were reported to the MECP starting in 2017 in accordance with O. Reg. 143/16 - Quantification, Reporting, and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation standard quantification methods ON.350 and ON.400, respectively. 
EGD and Union Gas utilize emissions data management processes and systems to help with the data capture and mandatory and voluntary reporting needs. Quantification methodologies and emission factors will continually be updated in the system as required. Each utility publicly reports its GHG emissions. Collectively, EGD and Union Gas continue to work with industry associations to refine quantification methodologies and emissions factors, as well as best management practices to minimize emissions.

EMPLOYEES
We had approximately 12,000 employees as at December 31, 2018, including approximately 8,500 employees in Canada and approximately 3,500 employees in the United States. Approximately 1,800 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. Approximately 48% of those employees are covered under agreements that either have expired or will expire by December 31, 2019. We are currently in the process of collective bargaining with respect to the expired or expiring contracts. We have mature working relationships with our labor unions and the parties have traditionally committed themselves to the achievement of renewal agreements without a work stoppage.
