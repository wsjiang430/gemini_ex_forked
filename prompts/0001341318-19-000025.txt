 ﻿
 General
 Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc. (“Lake Shore Bancorp,” the “Company,” “us,” or “we”) operates as a mid-tier, federally chartered savings and loan holding company for Lake Shore Savings Bank (“Lake Shore Savings” or the “Bank”).  A majority of Lake Shore Bancorp’s issued and outstanding common stock (60.6% as of December 31, 2018) is held by Lake Shore, MHC (the “MHC”), a federally chartered mutual holding company, which serves as the parent company to Lake Shore Bancorp.  The remaining shares of common stock are owned by public shareholders and Lake Shore Saving Bank’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).   Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “LSBK”.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to Lake Shore Bancorp or Lake Shore Savings include Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore Savings on a consolidated basis. Lake Shore, MHC
 Lake Shore, MHC was organized in 2006 as a federally chartered mutual holding company. The MHC does not engage in any substantial business activity other than its investment in a majority of the common stock of Lake Shore Bancorp.  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) is the regulator for the MHC.  Federal law and regulations require that as long as the MHC is in existence, it must own at least a majority of Lake Shore Bancorp’s common stock.   Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc.
 Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc. was organized in 2006 for the purpose of acting as the savings and loan holding company for Lake Shore Savings Bank in connection with the Company’s initial public stock offering.  The Company, a federal corporation, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board.     Lake Shore Savings Bank
 Lake Shore Savings Bank was chartered as a New York savings and loan association in 1891.  In 2006, the Bank converted from a New York-chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federal savings bank charter. The Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  
 Lake Shore Savings Bank’s principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding its branch offices and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, commercial business loans, consumer loans, and investment securities.  Our revenues are principally derived from interest earned on our loans and investment securities.  Our primary sources of funds for lending and investments are deposits, borrowings, receipts of principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from sales of loans or securities, maturities and calls of investment securities and income resulting from operations in prior periods.
 Recent Events
 On November 26, 2018, Lake Shore Savings Bank filed an application with the OCC seeking approval to convert the bank’s charter from a federal savings bank to a national bank under the name “Lake Shore Bank, National Association.”  Lake Shore Savings Bank’s conversion to a national bank charter will enable it to engage in business activities authorized for national banks, including establishing deposit and account relationships with New York municipalities and other public entities.  Currently, under New York law, municipalities and public entities within New York State may not deposit funds with either state- or federally-chartered savings banks.  In connection with Lake Shore Savings Bank’s charter conversion, the Company and the MHC, the majority

stockholder of the Company, have filed applications seeking approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become bank holding companies.  In order to become bank holding companies, the Company and the MHC will be required to eliminate their federal charters, and will reincorporate as a Maryland corporation and a Delaware non-stock corporation, respectively.  After Lake Shore Savings Bank’s charter conversion and the Company’s reincorporation in Maryland, the Company will remain in the public mutual holding company structure with the same stock ownership percentages that existed prior to the charter conversions. On February 25, 2019, the OCC approved the charter conversion of Lake Shore Savings Bank. The Federal Reserve Board continues to review the applications filed by the Company and the MHC.

 ﻿
 Market Area
 Lake Shore Savings Bank is a community bank that offers a variety of banking products to serve the market areas surrounding our eleven branch offices located within the Western New York region of New York State.   
 Our geographic market area for loans and deposits is principally located within Erie and Chautauqua Counties, within Western New York. As of 2018, Erie and Chautauqua Counties had a combined population of approximately 1.1 million.  Our market area is bounded by Lake Erie to the west and Canada to the north, and includes the city of Buffalo, the second largest city in the State of New York by population.  The market area includes 13 hospitals, a medical school and a major cancer research and treatment facility, along with a centralized medical campus to cultivate clinical care, research, education and entrepreneurship.  The area has ten colleges and universities, three community colleges and various vocational and technical schools.  Western New York is home to professional sports franchises and an international airport.  The area hosts a broad diversity of industry, commercial establishments and financial institutions as well as a skilled and productive workforce.  
 New York State currently has several incentive programs for businesses to invest in the Western New York region.  One example is the “Start-Up NY” program, which offers tax incentives to start, expand or relocate a qualified business to a tax-free area within the state, primarily near a university or community college campus, in order to access top talent and research facilities.  Qualified businesses for this program include advance materials & manufacturing, biotech & life sciences, tech & electronics, and optics & imaging.  This program has generated significant interest in Western New York for new business development, due to its proximity to Canada, history of being a strong industrial and manufacturing center, and the number of quality colleges and universities in the area.   
 The Erie County region and the City of Buffalo have recently experienced economic expansion led by major growth in the health care and education sectors, and resurgence in the central business district, which has led to an influx of private investment in development of hotels and housing in the downtown sector.  Major construction projects have been recently completed or are currently underway.  The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus has grown significantly with the construction of a new children’s hospital, expansion of an existing cancer/research hospital and construction of a new medical school by the State University of New York at Buffalo. Development on the waterfront has centered on redevelopment of property for mixed use, including public access and private development that includes office space, ice rinks, hotels and restaurants. The economic development within the region also impacts the small business and middle-market customers that we focus on and we believe we will be able to capitalize on opportunities created by economic growth in this section of our market area.

Our primary market area has historically been stable, with a diversified base of employers and employment sectors. The local economies that we serve are not dependent on one key employer. Transportation equipment is a large manufacturing industry in the Buffalo area, as well as production of automobile component parts. The principal employment sectors are service-related, wholesale and retail trade, and durable-goods manufacturing.  
 Our future growth will be influenced by the strength of our regional economy, other demographic trends and the competitive environment.  We believe that we have developed lending products and marketing strategies to address the credit-related needs of the residents and small businesses in our local market area.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Western New York has a significant number of financial institutions, many of which are branches of large money centers and regional and super regional banks which have resulted from the consolidation of the banking industry in New York and surrounding states. Some of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. For example, we do not offer trust or investment services. Customers who seek “one stop shopping” may be drawn to our competitors who offer such services. We also face significant competition from online service providers who offer financial services, including loan and deposit products.
 ﻿
 Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, online retail mortgage lenders and other financial service companies. The most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, and online banks. We face additional competition for deposits from non-depository competitors such as mutual funds, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. We are significantly smaller than many of the financial institution competitors in our market area.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as that imposed on federal savings banks or federally insured institutions, and these other institutions may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively. We remain very competitive in Chautauqua County, New York and, as of June 30, 2018 (the latest date such information is available), we had 14.7% of total deposits and ranked fifth out of the nine banks in this market area, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) annual deposit market share report. Our deposit market share in Erie County, New York has increased since we entered this market area in 2003 and we had the largest percentage increase in market share (13.6% increase) from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2018 when compared to the other top ten banks in Erie County. We believe the primary factors in competing for deposits and loans is through personalized service, knowledge of the local market area and its economy factors, local decision making, technological convenience via mobile and online banking and active participation and support of the communities we serve. 
 ﻿
 Lending Activities
 General.  Historically, as a thrift institution, we primarily originated residential mortgage loans, including home equity loans. In recent years, we have become more focused on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans, also known as C&I Lending, to add adjustable rate loans to our portfolio, meet the needs of small business customers and manage interest rate risk. We retain the majority of loans that we originate. However, we have sold residential mortgage loans into the secondary market, with retention of servicing rights, from time to time in order to manage interest rate risk, and we may do so again in the future, when deemed appropriate. In prior years we have purchased a limited number of equipment loans from a third party broker, which are secured by first liens on the new equipment purchases by small businesses located throughout the Northeastern United States. We have not purchased these types of loans since the first quarter of 2015.

 Loan Portfolio.  The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan, in dollar amounts and in percentages at the dates indicated. We did not have any loans held for sale as of these dates.

There were no loans sold to the FHLMC during 2018 and 2017.

 One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Lending.  At December 31, 2018, our one- to four-family residential loans (including construction loans) totaled $155.0 million and represented 39.5% of the total loan portfolio.  Our residential mortgage loan originations are obtained from customers, residents of our local communities or referrals from local real estate agents, brokers, attorneys and builders. Lake Shore Savings has historically retained the majority of residential mortgage loans that it originates. As a result, Lake Shore Savings is exposed to increases in market interest rates, because the yield earned on fixed-rate assets would remain fixed, while the rates paid by Lake Shore Savings for deposits and borrowings may increase, which could result in lower net interest income. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, the Bank may sell long-term fixed rate residential mortgages at origination in the secondary market, with servicing retained, if deemed appropriate.

 One- to four-family residential mortgage loan originations are generally for terms up to 30 years;  however, we do offer and have successfully originated loans with shorter terms of 10, 15, or 20 years.  One- to four-family residential real estate loans may remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms as borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option without penalty.  Conventional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans originated by us customarily contain “due-on-sale” clauses that permit us to accelerate the indebtedness of the loan upon transfer of ownership of the mortgaged property.  We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans or “negative amortization” mortgage loans. 
 Our residential lending policies and procedures ensure that the majority of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans generally conform to secondary market guidelines, although we also originate non-conforming loans. We underwrite all conforming loans (i.e. loans with less than a $453,100 loan balance during 2018) using the criteria required by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”).  We originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio up to 97%, and up to 103.5% with our United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Rural Development Guaranteed Loan Program (“GLP”) mortgage loan product.  Mortgages originated with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80% normally require private mortgage insurance.  After a conforming loan is originated and funded, we may sell the loan to FHLMC.  During 2018, we did not sell any loans to FHLMC, but we may do so in the future, if deemed appropriate in order to manage interest rate risk. We also offer loans through programs offered by the State of New York Mortgage Agency (“SONYMA”) which are originated for sale.  During 2018, we originated and sold $944,000 of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to SONYMA. We retain all servicing rights for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we sell. 
 We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which we refer to as “jumbo loans.” We originate jumbo loans with fixed-rates and terms of up to 30 years. At December 31, 2018, jumbo loans totaled $8.6 million, or 5.5% of the one- to four-family residential mortgage portfolio.
 We offer adjustable rate mortgage loans with a maximum term of 30 years.  When an adjustable rate mortgage is originated, the initial interest rate is established based on market conditions and competitor rates. The rate adjusts annually after one, five, or seven years, depending on the loan product. After the initial fixed rate time period, the interest rate on these loans will re-price based upon a specific U.S. Treasury index plus an additional margin, taking into consideration the cap and floor rates established at the time of loan origination.
 The retention of adjustable rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in our loan portfolio helps reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates.  However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of the pricing of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans.  During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on one- to four-family residential adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase due to the increase of interest cost to the borrower. Furthermore, changes in the interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages may be limited by an initial fixed-rate period or by contractual limits on periodic interest rate adjustments, and as such adjustable rate loans may not adjust as quickly as our interest-bearing liabilities during a period of rapid increases in interest rates.
 One- to four-family real estate loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying collateral. The majority of our one- to four-family residential loans are backed by property located in Western New York and are affected by economic conditions in this market area. Western New York’s housing market has consistently demonstrated stability in home prices despite economic conditions, resulting in stable collateral value and lower risk of loss.
 ﻿
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We currently provide all-in-one home equity lines of credit and have provided home equity loans in the past to our customers.  Home equity lines of credit are generally made for owner-occupied homes, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residences. At December 31, 2018, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $41.8 million and represented 10.7% of the total loan portfolio. The all-in-one home equity line of credit must have a minimum line amount of $5,000 up to a maximum of 90% of the total loan-to-value ratio for qualified borrowers. The all-in-one home equity line of credit products have interest rates tied to the prime rate and generally have a 15 year draw period and a 15 year

payback period.  Since 2010, our adjustable rate home equity loans include limits on decreases in the interest rate of the loan. The decrease in the interest rate may not be below the “floor” rate established at time of origination. A customer has the option to convert either a portion, or the entire line of credit balance, to a term loan at a fixed rate of interest.  As the customer pays down the balance on the term loan, the funds available on the line of credit increase by a like amount.  All-in-one home equity lines of credit have 30 year maximum terms.
 Home equity loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying property. Home equity loans may have increased risk of loss if the Company does not hold the first mortgage resulting in the Company being in a secondary position in the event of collateral liquidation. At December 31, 2018, home equity loans and lines of credit where the Company does not hold the first mortgage represented 16.7% of our home equity loan portfolio. During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on home equity loans may increase due to the increase of interest cost to the borrower.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans.  We originate commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property or to refinance real property, which generally consists of developed real estate, such as office buildings, warehouses, retail properties, mixed use properties, self-storage units and multi-family apartment complexes, which are typically held as collateral for the loan.  At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans totaled $150.5 million and represented 38.3% of the total loan portfolio. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, consideration is given to the property’s historic cash flow, paying capacity of the borrower, current and projected occupancy levels, location, and physical condition. 
 We originate a variety of fixed and adjustable rate commercial real estate loans generally for terms of five to 10 years and payments based on an amortization schedule of up to 20 to 25 years.  Adjustable rate loans are typically based on an index with an added spread based on the type, size and risk of the loan and the rate is typically fixed for the first five years.  We typically lend up to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50% to 80% depending on the type of property being financed.  Commercial real estate loans require a minimum debt service coverage ratio ranging from 1.15 to 1.50 depending on the type of property being financed, a first lien on collateral and the personal guarantees of the owners. Loans are typically subject to prepayment penalties if the loan is paid off before the scheduled maturity within five years of origination.

Commercial real estate lending involves additional risks compared with one- to four-family residential lending, because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, the borrower’s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower’s business or rental income and/or the collateral value of the commercial real estate securing the loan.  Repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economic conditions to a greater extent than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  In addition tenancy of the properties needs to be monitored as to occupancy, lease rates, term of lease and tenant worthiness.  Also, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, which generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.  Our loan policies limit the amount of loans to a single borrower or group of borrowers to reduce this risk and are designed to set such limits within those prescribed by applicable federal and state statutes and regulations. We engage a third party, once a year, to conduct a credit review of the commercial real estate portfolio, including compliance with the Bank’s underwriting standards and policy requirements. In addition we engage a third party annually to perform property site inspections as required by Commercial Loan Policy.  
 ﻿
 Construction Loans.  We originate loans to finance the construction of both one- to four-family homes and commercial real estate.  These loans typically have a construction period of up to 12 months for residential construction and up to 24 months for commercial construction, whereby draws are taken and interest only payments are made.  As part of the draw process, inspection and lien checks are required prior to the disbursement of the proceeds.  Funds disbursed may not exceed up to 80% of the loan-to-value of land and up to 80% of loan-to-value of improvements at any time during the construction period. Interest rates on disbursed funds are based on the rates and terms set at closing. The majority of our commercial real estate construction loans are variable rate loans with rates tied to prime rate, plus a premium, while the majority of our one- to four-family real estate construction loans are fixed rate loans.  A floor rate may also be established in conjunction

with a variable rate loan. A minimum of interest only payments on disbursed funds must be made on a monthly basis. At the end of the construction period, the loan automatically converts to either a conventional residential or commercial real estate mortgage, as applicable. At December 31, 2018, construction loans totaled $22.3 million, or 5.7% of the total loan portfolio. 
 Construction loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of underlying property. Construction loans may have additional risks related to advancing loan funds during construction due to the uncertain value of the property prior to the completion of construction.
 Commercial Loans. In addition to commercial real estate loans, we also engage in commercial business lending, (also known as C&I lending) primarily to small businesses. A commercial business loan may be a business installment loan, line of credit, or other commercial loan. At December 31, 2018, commercial business loans totaled $21.8 million, or 5.6% of the total loan portfolio. Most of our commercial business loans have fixed interest rates, and are for terms generally not in excess of five years. In underwriting commercial business loans, consideration is typically given to the financial condition and the debt service coverage capabilities of the borrower/project, projected cash flows and collateral value. Whenever possible, we collateralize these loans with a first lien on general business assets and a specific lien on the equipment being purchased and require personal guarantees from principals of the borrower. Interest rates on commercial business loans generally have higher yields than rates on one- to four-family residential mortgages. We offer commercial loan services designed to give business owners borrowing opportunities for modernization, inventory, equipment, construction, real estate, purchases or improvements, working capital, vehicle purchases, and the refinancing of existing corporate debt.
 ﻿
 Commercial business loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans because the collateral underlying the loans may be in the form of furniture, fixtures, and equipment and/or inventory subject to market obsolescence and accounts receivable which must be monitored. Commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, with the repayment of such loans typically dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower’s operation. Such risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. In addition, commercial business lending generally requires substantially greater oversight efforts compared to residential real estate lending. We engage a third party, twice a year, to conduct credit reviews of the commercial business loan portfolio, including compliance with the Bank’s underwriting standards and policy requirements.
 Consumer Loans.  To a lesser extent, we offer a variety of consumer loans.  At December 31, 2018, consumer loans totaled $1.2 million, or less than 1% of the total loan portfolio.  Generally, the volume of consumer lending has declined as borrowers have opted for home equity lines of credit, which have lower interest rates, as compared to unsecured loans or loans secured by property other than residential real estate. 
 The largest component of our consumer loan portfolio are personal consumer loans and overdraft lines of credit, which are available for amounts up to $5,000 for unsecured loans and greater amounts for secured loans depending on the type of loan and value of the collateral.  Consumer loans may have terms up to 10 years, depending on the collateral and loan type. Our consumer loan portfolio also consists of vehicle loans, other unsecured consumer loans up to $5,000, loans secured by certificates of deposits, secured and unsecured property improvement loans, and other secured loans.
 Consumer loans are generally originated at higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans or home equity loans but also tend to have a higher credit risk due to the loans being either unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets.  Furthermore, consumer loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. The application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on consumer loans in the event of a default. Despite these risks, our level of consumer loan delinquencies generally has been low.  No assurance can be given, however, that our delinquency rate or losses will continue to remain low in the future.

Loan Participations. From time to time, we may originate a commercial real estate loan or commercial business loan which may exceed our internal lending or concentration limits and sell a portion of the loan to another community bank.  The participating bank is typically located in New York State and its lending team is known by our commercial lenders.  This allows our Bank to meet the needs of its customers and comply with its internal lending limits. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. We have strong relationships with other community banks in our primary market area that may desire to purchase participations, and we may increase our sales of participations in the future, if deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2018, our sold participations in commercial real estate and commercial business loans totaled $9.5 million and $901,000, respectively, all of which were collateralized by properties or business assets within our primary market area in Western New York.
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending policies are approved by our Board of Directors. Branch managers may have the authority to originate home equity or consumer loans up to amounts approved by the Board of Directors for each lending officer.  Home equity loans and consumer loans secured by real estate in excess of $25,000 and all one- to four-family residential mortgage loans up to $453,100 require approval by the Internal Residential Loan Committee. If these types of loans are between $453,100 and $1.0 million, then the approval of a designated member of management and a member of the Internal Residential Loan Committee is required. If these types of loans are in excess of $1.0 million, then full Board approval is required.  Commercial Loan Officers may have the authority to originate commercial real estate and commercial business loans up to amounts approved by the Board of Directors for each lending officer. Commercial loans with total one obligor credit in excess of $100,000 and up to $1.0 million require the approval of two members of the Internal Commercial Loan Committee, one of which must be a designated member of executive management. Commercial loans with total one obligor credit in excess of $1.0 million and up to $3.0 million require majority approval by the Board Loan Committee. Commercial loans with total obligor credit in excess of $3.0 million require full Board approval.
 ﻿
 Current Lending Procedures.  Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, we order a credit report and verify certain other information.  If necessary, we obtain additional financial or credit related information.  We require an appraisal for all residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans, including loans made to refinance existing mortgage loans.  Appraisals are performed by licensed third-party appraisal firms that have been approved by our Board of Directors.  An appraisal management firm has been hired to handle all requests for appraisals on residential real estate loans. We require title insurance on all one- to four-family residential and commercial real estate loans and certain other loans.  We also require hazard insurance on all real estate loans, and if applicable, we require borrowers to obtain flood insurance prior to closing.  Based on loan-to-value ratios and lending guidelines, escrow accounts may be required for such items as real estate taxes, hazard insurance, flood insurance, and private mortgage insurance premiums.
 ﻿
 Asset Quality
 One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality.  Our high proportion of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans primarily collateralized by property in Western New York state with stable property values, the maintenance of sound credit standards for new loan originations, our loan review procedures, including third party loan reviews, and strong executive management focus on credit quality have been factors in monitoring and managing our levels of credit risk. These factors have contributed to our strong financial condition.
 Collection Procedures. We have adopted a loan collection policy to maintain adequate control on the status of delinquent loans and to ensure compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Protection Act, along with the New York State Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law.  When a borrower fails to make required payments on a residential, home equity, commercial, or consumer loan, we take a number of steps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status.

Prior to proceeding with any foreclosure action in the case of a secured loan, we will review the collateral to determine whether its possession would be cost-effective for us. In cases where the collateral fails to fully secure the loan, in addition to repossessing the collateral, we may also sue on the note underlying the loan.
 Non-performing Loans and Non-performing Assets. We define non-performing loans as loans that are either non-accruing or accruing whose payments are 90 days or more past due, and non-accruing troubled debt restructurings.  Loans are placed on non-accrual status either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest and principal, or when a loan becomes 90 days past due, unless an evaluation by the internal Asset Classification Committee indicates that the loan is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured.  When our Asset Classification Committee designates loans on which we stop accruing interest income as non-accrual loans, we reverse outstanding interest income that was previously credited.  We return a non-accrual loan to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist. 
 ﻿
 Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until such time as it is sold.  We carry foreclosed real estate at its fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition.  If a foreclosure action is commenced and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the property could be sold at the foreclosure sale (to an outside bidder). If not, and we retain the property, then we will sell the real property securing the loan as soon thereafter as practical.  
 Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) occur when we grant borrowers concessions that we would not otherwise grant but for economic or legal reasons pertaining to the borrower’s financial difficulties.  A concession is made when the terms of the loan modification are more favorable than the terms the borrower would have received in the current market under similar financial difficulties.  These concessions may include, but are not limited to, modifications of the terms of the debt, the transfer of assets or the issuance of an equity interest by the borrower to satisfy all or part of the debt, or the substitution or addition of borrower(s).  The Company identifies loans for potential TDRs primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of the borrower’s financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions, and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future. Generally, we will not return a TDR to accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make principal and interest payments under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. Our TDRs are impaired loans, which may result in specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses and subsequent charge-offs if appropriate.

Our recorded investment in non-accrual loans decreased by $800,000 from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018,  primarily due to a $941,000 decrease in non-performing commercial real estate loans. The decrease was primarily the result of the foreclosure and subsequent sale of one non-performing commercial real estate loan with a balance of $1.0 million during 2018. If all non-accrual loans had been current in accordance with their terms during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, interest income on such loans would have amounted to $237,000, $265,000 and $366,000, respectively.
 ﻿
 Classification of Loans. Federal regulations require us to regularly review and classify our loans.  In addition, our regulators have the authority to identify problem loans and, if appropriate, require them to be classified.  Management closely monitors the quality of the loan portfolio and has established a loan review process designed to help grade the quality of the Company’s loan portfolio.  The credit quality grade helps management make a consistent assessment of each loan relationship’s credit risk.  Consistent with regulatory guidelines, the Company classifies loans and other assets considered of lesser quality.  Such ratings coincide with the “Substandard”, Doubtful”, and “Loss” classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions.  Regulations also provide for a “special mention” category (i.e. criticized loans), described as loans which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention.  For further discussion on how management determines when a loan should be classified, refer to Note 5, Allowance for Loan Losses in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report.
 The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management’s evaluation of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio. When we classify loans as either substandard or doubtful, we set aside a loss reserve for such loans as we deem prudent. When we classify problem loans as loss, we typically charge-off the loan balance outstanding against the allowance for loan losses reserve.  Our determination as to the classification of our loans and the amount of our loss allowances are subject to review by our regulators, which can require that we establish additional loss allowances.

 Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our evaluation of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio, the composition of the loan portfolio, specific impaired loans and current economic conditions.  We maintain the allowance through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income.  We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of the loan is unlikely, and all possible avenues of repayment have been analyzed, including the potential of future cash flow, the value of the underlying collateral, and strength of any guarantors or co-borrowers.
 Our evaluation of risk in maintaining the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.  We consider the following qualitative and environmental factors as part of this evaluation: historical loan loss experience; payment status; the estimated value of the underlying collateral; changes in lending policies, procedures and loan review system; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; trends in loan volume and the nature of the loan portfolio; and national and local economic conditions.  There may be other factors that may warrant consideration in maintaining an allowance at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses.  Although our management believes that it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses to reflect losses inherent in our loan portfolio, based on its evaluation of the factors noted above, future additions may be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
 In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.  These agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate based on their evaluation of the information available to them at the time of their examination.
 The allowance consists of allocated, general and unallocated components.  The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful, substandard, loss or special mention.  See “Asset Quality – Classification of Loans.”  For such loans that are also classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan.  The general component covers non-classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative and environmental factors, as mentioned above.  An unallocated component may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses, such as downturns in the local economy. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision 

 
13


 
inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general losses in the portfolio.
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will not be able to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial real estate loans and commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, we do not separately identify individual consumer, home equity or one- to four-family real estate loans for impairment disclosures, unless they are subject to a troubled debt restructuring or part of the assessment of a larger loan relationship. Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our impaired loans.

 Provision for loan losses decreased by $120,000, or 23.5%, to $390,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $510,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in provision expense was primarily due to a higher provision being recorded during 2017 for the downgrade in loan classification for two commercial loan relationships. As of December 31, 2018, these downgraded loans were performing, and well collateralized by commercial real estate, as well as fixtures and equipment.  The ratio of nonperforming loans to total net loans was 0.82% as of December 31, 2018 which was a 23 basis points decrease from 1.05% at December 31, 2017, primarily due to a $941,000 decrease in non-performing commercial real estate loans. The decrease in non-performing commercial real estate loans was primarily due to the foreclosure and subsequent sale in 2018 of one commercial real estate loan which had a loan balance of $1.0 million. The majority of our non-performing loans are one- to four-family residential mortgage loans or commercial real estate loans backed by first lien collateral on real estate held in the Western New York region. Western New York’s real estate market has consistently demonstrated price stability.
 The following table presents our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans at the years indicated.  The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of inherent losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

 Investment Activities
 General.  The general objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide for the overall asset/liability management of the bank.  All of our securities carry market risk, as increases in market rates of interest may cause a decrease in the fair value of the securities. Our investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, to provide collateral for pledging requirements, to generate a 

 
16


 
favorable return without incurring undue interest rate or credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity within established guidelines.  Our investment policy outlines the pre-purchase analysis, credit, and interest rate risk assessment guidelines and due diligence documentation required for all permissible investments. In addition, our policy requires management to routinely monitor the investment portfolio as well as the markets for changes which may have a material, negative impact on the credit quality of our holdings. Our Board of Directors reviews and approves our investment policy on an annual basis.  The Board of Directors has delegated primary responsibility for ensuring that the guidelines in the investment policy are followed to the Asset-Liability Committee of the Board.  The board designates members of executive management with the authority to purchase securities within established plans and guidelines.  All transactions are reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee of the Board of Directors which meets at least quarterly.  
 In establishing our investment strategies, we consider our interest rate sensitivity, the types of securities to be held, liquidity and other factors.  The Company’s current investment strategy utilizes a risk management approach of diversified investing among three categories:  short-, intermediate-, and long-term.  The emphasis of this approach is to increase overall investment securities yields while managing interest rate risk and meeting liquidity needs.  The Company has engaged an independent financial advisor to recommend investment securities according to a plan which has been approved by the Asset/Liability Committee and the Board of Directors.  Federal savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including U.S. Government obligations, securities of various federal agencies, obligations of states and municipalities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, collateralized-mortgage obligations, certain time deposits of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers’ acceptances, repurchase agreements, loans of federal funds, and, subject to certain limits, corporate debt and commercial paper.
 All of the securities in our portfolio are classified as “available for sale.” The securities are reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on the securities are excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred taxes, as a separate component of equity. Our current securities portfolio consists of collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, asset-backed securities, U.S. Government Agency bonds, and municipal bonds.  Nearly all of our mortgage backed securities are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by FHLMC, the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) or the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”, or “Fannie Mae”).  The municipal securities we invest in have maturities of 20 years or less and many have private insurance guaranteeing repayment. The majority of municipal securities in our portfolio are unlimited general obligation bonds. 
 We have investments in FHLBNY stock, which must be held as a condition of membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system.  The investment in FHLBNY stock is considered restricted and is reported at cost on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 Fair values of available for sale securities are based on a market approach.  Securities which are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets, are valued using prices obtained from our custodian, which uses third party data service providers. 
 ﻿
 Classification of Investments. Federal regulations require us to regularly review and classify our investments based on credit risk in determining credit quality of investment portfolios as well as for calculating risk based capital.  A decline in the market value of a security due to interest rate fluctuations is not a basis for adverse classification. Instead, the classification is based on the likelihood of the timely and full collection of principal and interest. 
 In assessing the credit quality of securities in our investment portfolio, we conduct an internal risk analysis, which includes a review of third party research and analytics. If our research indicates that an issuer of a security does not have adequate capacity to meet its financial obligations for the life of the asset, the Company will review the security and consider it for classification.
 A security may be classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss. A “Substandard” classification indicates that the investment is inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the 

 
17


 
collateral pledged. Investments classified as “Substandard” must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and the Company may sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.  A “Doubtful” classification has all the weaknesses of a “Substandard” classification with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. Investments classified as “Loss” are considered uncollectible and their continuance as an asset of the Company is no longer warranted.
 Our determination as to the classification of our investments is subject to review by our regulators.  We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine whether any investments require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.  Our review of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 resulted in two private-label asset-backed securities that were considered for classification, as the issuer may not have an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments over the projected life of the investment or the risk of default by the obligor was possible, resulting in an expectation that the Bank would not receive the full and timely repayment of principal and interest as expected.  These two securities had an amortized cost of $0 and fair value of $270,000 at December 31, 2018. These two securities were classified as “Substandard.” Five securities were evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2018. We concluded that no other than temporary impairment charges needed to be recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recaptured $145,000, $135,000 and $142,000, respectively, of prior year other-than-temporary impairment charges. The recaptured amounts are reflected in the “recovery on previously impaired investment securities” line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 Investment Securities Portfolio, Maturities and Yields.  The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities, amortized cost and weighted average yields for our investment portfolio, with the exception of equity securities, at December 31, 2018.  Due to repayments of the underlying loans, the average life maturities of 

 
18


 
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities generally are substantially less than the final maturities. Expected maturities for municipal bonds may differ from contractual maturities, because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.  The weighted average yield does not include the impact of a tax-equivalent adjustment for bank qualified municipals.

 Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits are our major source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. We may also borrow funds, primarily from the FHLBNY, to supplement the amount of funds available for lending and daily operations.  In addition, we derive funds from loan and mortgage-backed securities principal repayments and prepayments and from interest and proceeds from the maturity and call of investment securities. Loans and securities payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by pricing strategies and money market conditions
 Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms.  We currently offer regular savings deposits (consisting of Christmas Club, passbook and statement savings accounts), money market savings and checking accounts, interest bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts (i.e., demand deposits), health savings accounts, retirement accounts, time deposits and Interest on Lawyer Accounts (“IOLA”). In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer commercial savings, checking and money market accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area.  
 Deposit flows are influenced significantly by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, pricing of deposits, and competition.  Our deposits are obtained from communities surrounding our offices and we rely primarily on paying competitive rates, service, and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits.  We do not rely on brokers to obtain deposits, although we are a participant in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”). This program offers our depositors enhanced FDIC insurance coverage.  On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 was signed into law and as a result reciprocal deposits obtained via CDARS are generally not considered brokered deposits.  At this time, the funds obtained from CDARS are not considered brokered deposits.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $5.5 million of depositor funds placed in the CDARS program.
 When we determine our deposit rates, we consider local competition, U.S. Treasury securities offerings, our liquidity needs, and the rates charged on other sources of funds.  We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates to attract funds and to focus on the acquisition of lower cost core deposits as opportunities arise.

 Supervision and Regulation    General
     Lake Shore Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank, is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, while Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc. and Lake Shore, MHC, which are federally chartered savings and loan holding companies, are subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.  This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors.  Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates.  Lake Shore Savings also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  Lake Shore Savings also is regulated, to a lesser extent, by the FDIC with respect to insurance of deposit accounts and the Federal Reserve Board, with respect to reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters.  Lake Shore Savings’ relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state laws, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Lake Shore Savings’ mortgage documents.

complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effect on Lake Shore Savings, Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore, MHC and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
 ﻿
 The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board.  The CFPB assumes responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to prudential regulators, and has authority to impose new requirements.  However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their primary regulator rather than the CFPB.
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things:

· | directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | mandated the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | required originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for sold loans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | regulated rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

      The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so called “Golden Parachute” payments. In addition, the CFPB has finalized a rule implementing the “Ability to Repay” requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The regulations generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination as to a borrower’s ability to repay most residential mortgage loans. The rule also sets standards for mortgage servicing, loan originator compensation, and requirements for high-cost mortgages, appraisal and escrow standards.  The final rule establishes a safe harbor for certain “Qualified Mortgages,” which contain certain features deemed less risky and omit certain other characteristics considered to enhance risk.  The Ability to Repay final rules were effective January 1, 2014. On October 3, 2015, the new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (“TRID”) rules for mortgage closings took effect for new loan applications. In 2017, the CFPB amended the TRID rule with an effective date of October 1, 2018.
 ﻿
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018
 ﻿
 On May 24, 2018, The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “EGRRCPA”) was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The EGRRCPA’s provisions include, among other things: (i) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not requiring appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempting banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from HMDA’s expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarifying that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC’s brokered-deposit regulations; (v) raising eligibility for the 18-month exam cycle from $1 billion to banks with $3 billion in assets; (vi) providing federal savings associations with less than $20.0 billion in consolidated assets with the option to elect to operate under the same powers as a national bank; and (vii) simplifying capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status.  In addition, the law required the Federal Reserve Board to raise the asset threshold under its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion for bank or savings and loan holding companies that are exempt from consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities.

﻿
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 ﻿
 Business Activities. A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and the regulations of the OCC.  Under these laws and regulations, Lake Shore Savings may originate mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business loans and consumer loans, and it may invest in certain types of debt securities and certain other assets.  Certain types of lending, such as commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, are subject to an aggregate limit calculated as a specified percentage of Lake Shore Savings’ capital or assets.  Specifically, Lake Shore Savings may invest in non-residential real estate loans which may not in the aggregate exceed 400% of capital, commercial business loans up to 20% of assets in the aggregate and consumer loans up to 35% of assets in the aggregate.  Lake Shore Savings also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for Lake Shore Savings, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
 ﻿
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require a federal savings bank to meet certain minimum capital standards.  In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that revised the leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in “Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems” (“Basel III”) and with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective on January 1, 2015.
 ﻿
 The revised rule established a new minimum common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a uniform minimum leverage ratio of 4%, increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets and maintained the total capital ratio of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets.  Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a CET1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% and a leverage ratio of 5%. The final rule requires unrealized gains and losses on certain “available for sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out is exercised.  Lake Shore Savings Bank has exercised this one-time opt-out and therefore excluded unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings for purposes of calculating regulatory capital.  Additional restraints are also imposed on the inclusion in regulatory capital of mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and minority interests.  
 ﻿
 Core capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings but excluding accumulated other comprehensive income), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships.  The components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital.  Additionally, a savings bank that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale may be required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the recourse back to the savings bank. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the federal regulators take into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary.  
 ﻿
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 1,250%, assigned by federal regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  The new capital requirements assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.  
 ﻿


 
23


 
The final rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and ending January 1, 2019. The full capital conservation buffer requirement is now in effect.
 ﻿
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the EGRRCPA, the OCC proposed a rule that establishes a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at 9% for institutions under $10 billion in assets that such institutions may elect to utilize in lieu of the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III.  Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio and certain other qualifying criteria will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized.  Until the OCC’s proposed rule is finalized, the Basel III risk-based and leverage ratios remain in effect.  
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, Lake Shore Savings’ capital exceeded all applicable minimal capital requirements.
 Loans to One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus.  An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate.  As of December 31, 2018, Lake Shore Savings Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings bank, Lake Shore Savings is subject to a qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” requirement by meeting one of two tests:  The Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”) QTL test or the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Domestic Building and Loan Association (“DBLA”) test.  The federal savings bank may use either test to qualify and may switch from one test to the other.
  Under the HOLA QTL test, Lake Shore Savings must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period.  “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings bank’s business.
 “Qualified thrift investments” includes various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes, investments related to such purposes, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities, and loans for personal, family, household and certain other purposes up to a limit of 20% of portfolio assets.  “Qualified thrift investments” also include 100% of an institution’s credit card loans, education loans and small business loans. 
 ﻿
 Under the IRS DBLA test, the Bank must meet the business operations test and the 60% of assets test.  The business operations test requires that the federal savings bank’s business consists primarily of acquiring the savings of the public (75% of its deposits, withdrawable shares, and other obligations must be held by the general public) and investing in loans (more than 75% of its gross income consists of interest on loans and government obligations and various other specified types of operating income that federal savings bank’s ordinarily earn).  For the 60% of assets test, the Bank must maintain at least 60% of its total in “qualified investments” as of the close of the taxable year or, at the option of the federal savings bank, may be computed on the basis of the average assets outstanding during the taxable year.  
 ﻿
 A savings bank that fails the QTL test must either convert to a commercial bank charter or operate under specified restrictions.  The Dodd-Frank Act makes noncompliance with the QTL test potentially subject to agency enforcement action for violation of law.  At December 31, 2018, Lake Shore Savings Bank opted to utilize the HOLA QTL test and satisfied the requirements of this test for the entire 12-month period.

Capital Distributions. OCC regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account.  A savings bank must file an application for approval of a capital distribution if:

· | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank’s net income for that year to date plus the savings bank’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or OCC-imposed condition; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Even if an application is not otherwise required, every federal savings bank that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
 ﻿
 The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a notice or application if:

· | the savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would be undercapitalized.
 ﻿
 Liquidity. A federal savings institution is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation.  We seek to maintain a ratio of liquid assets not subject to pledge as a percentage of deposits and borrowings of 15% or greater. 
 ﻿
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods.  In connection with its examination of a federal savings bank, the OCC is required to assess the savings bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.  In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.  A savings bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities.  The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.  Lake Shore Savings Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.
 ﻿
 Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by OCC regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.  The term “affiliate” for these purposes generally means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Lake Shore Savings Bank.  Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc. and Lake Shore, MHC are affiliates of Lake Shore Savings Bank.  In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the savings bank as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.  In addition, certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the savings bank’s capital.  Collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the savings bank.  In addition, OCC regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary.  Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and may not involve low-quality assets.  The OCC requires savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.

﻿
 Lake Shore Savings’ authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board.  Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features, and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Lake Shore Savings Bank’s capital.  In addition, Lake Shore Savings Bank’s board of directors must approve extensions of credit in excess of certain limits.  Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions based on the category of loan.
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, Lake Shore Savings is in compliance with Regulation O.  
 ﻿
 Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution.  Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator.  Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day.  The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution.  If the OCC does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
 ﻿
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions.  These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate.  The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law.  The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits.  If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.  If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan.
 ﻿
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings banks.  For this purpose, a savings bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the savings bank’s capital:

· | well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% total risk-based capital);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 8% total risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 8% total risk-based capital);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
26


 

· | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 6% total risk-based capital); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

  As noted above, the EGRRCPA has eliminated the Basel III requirements for banks with less than $10 billion in assets who elect to follow the community bank leverage ratio once the OCC’s rule is finalized. The OCC’s proposed rule provides that the Bank will be well-capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 9% or greater, adequately capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5% or greater, undercapitalized if the Bank’s community bank leverage ratio is less than 7.5% and greater than 6% and significantly undercapitalized if the Bank’s community bank leverage ratio is less than 6%. The definition of critically undercapitalized is unchanged from the current regulations.
 ﻿
 Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames.  “Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to certain restrictions, such as on capital distributions and growth.  The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the savings bank will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the savings bank.  Any holding company for the savings bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5% of the savings bank’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status.  This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee.  The failure of a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings bank, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations.  The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.  
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, Lake Shore Savings met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized.” 
 ﻿
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Lake Shore Savings is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC.  Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC.  The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions to $250,000 per depositor. The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions.  
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits.  The FDIC was required to seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020.  The FDIC indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November 2018. Insured institutions with less than $10 billion of assets will receive credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase.  The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%.
 ﻿
 Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years.  In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings banks to 1.5 basis points to 40 basis points.


 
27


 
﻿
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments.  Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Lake Shore Savings.  Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 ﻿
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 ﻿
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  The bonds issued by the FICO began to mature in 2017 and will continue to mature through September 2019.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, Lake Shore Savings paid $14,000 related to the FICO bonds. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.35 of a basis point of total assets less tangible capital. 
 ﻿
 Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
 ﻿
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. Lake Shore Savings is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks.  The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.  As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Lake Shore Savings is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank.  As of December 31, 2018, Lake Shore Savings was in compliance with this requirement.
 ﻿
 Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings banks to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts, such as negotiable order of withdrawal and regular checking accounts. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.
 ﻿
 Other Regulations 
 ﻿
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Lake Shore Savings are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.  Lake Shore Savings’ operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 
· | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for one- to four-family residential real estate loans receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Truth in Savings Act; and
--+--------------------------


· | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

﻿
 The operations of Lake Shore Savings also are subject to the: 

· | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Title III of The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (referred to as the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which requires savings banks to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

 The Home Owners’ Loan Act prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore, MHC, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the Home Owners’ Loan Act; or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured.  In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
     The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies, and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
     Capital. Historically, savings and loan holding companies have not been subject to regulatory capital requirements.  The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for all depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.  On January 29, 2015, the Federal Reserve Board revised its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (“Policy Statement”) as directed by federal legislation to generally raise the total consolidated asset limit for the exemption from holding company capital requirements from $500 million to $1 billion, and expand the scope of the Policy Statement to include savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs).  In 2018, as a result of the enactment of EGRRCPA, the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement exemption was increased from $1.0 billion in consolidated assets to $3.0 billion in consolidated assets. As a result of these revisions, the MHC will be exempt from the regulatory capital requirements until consolidated assets exceed $3.0 billion.
     Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies.  The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that requires holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.  Federal Reserve Board policies also provide that holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the

prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized.  These regulatory policies may affect the ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends or otherwise make capital distributions.

 Waivers of Dividends by Lake Shore, MHC. The Dodd-Frank Act requires federally-chartered mutual holding companies to give the Federal Reserve Board notice before waiving the receipt of dividends, and provides that in the case of “grandfathered” mutual holding companies, like Lake Shore, MHC, the Federal Reserve Board “may not object” to a dividend waiver if the board of directors of the mutual holding company waiving dividends determines that the waiver: (i) would not be detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the subsidiary savings bank; and (ii) is consistent with the board’s fiduciary duties to members of the mutual holding company.  To qualify as a grandfathered mutual holding company, a mutual holding company must have been formed, issued stock and waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009.  Lake Shore, MHC qualifies as a grandfathered mutual holding company.  The Dodd-Frank Act further provides that the Federal Reserve Board may not consider waived dividends in determining an appropriate exchange ratio upon the conversion of a grandfathered mutual holding company to stock form.  The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule that also requires, as a condition to waiving dividends, that each mutual holding company obtain the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of its members within 12 months prior to the declaration of the dividend being waived.  Lake Shore, MHC solicited its members (depositors of Lake Shore Savings Bank) to vote on the proposal to waive the MHC’s receipt of quarterly cash dividends aggregating up to $0.48 per share to be declared by the Company for the four quarters ending September 30, 2019.  On February 6, 2019, the members approved the waiver of dividends. The Board of Directors of Lake Shore, MHC subsequently approved a dividend waiver in accordance with the regulations and submitted it to the Federal Reserve Board for their non-objection. As of March 7, 2019, Lake Shore, MHC received notice of the non-objection of the Federal Reserve Board to waive its right to receive dividends paid by the Company during the twelve months ending February 6, 2020. It is expected that Lake Shore, MHC will continue to waive future dividends, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund Lake Shore, MHC’s continuing operations, subject to the ability of Lake Shore, MHC to obtain regulatory approval of its requests to waive dividends and its ability to obtain future member approval of dividend waivers.  For more information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of Lake Shore Savings to make capital distributions to Lake Shore Bancorp and the waiver of dividends by Lake Shore, MHC.”
 ﻿
 Conversion of Lake Shore, MHC to Stock Form. Federal Reserve Board regulations permit Lake Shore, MHC to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization (a “Conversion Transaction”).  There can be no assurance when, if ever, a Conversion Transaction will occur, and the board of directors has no current intention or plan to undertake a Conversion Transaction.  In a Conversion Transaction, a new stock holding company would be formed as the successor to Lake Shore Bancorp (the “New Holding Company”), Lake Shore, MHC’s corporate existence would end, and certain depositors of Lake Shore Savings Bank would receive the right to subscribe for shares of the New Holding Company.  In a Conversion Transaction, each share of common stock held by stockholders other than Lake Shore, MHC (“Minority Stockholders”) would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the New Holding Company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that Minority Stockholders own the same percentage of common stock in the New Holding Company as they owned in Lake Shore Bancorp immediately prior to the Conversion Transaction.  The total number of shares of common stock held by Minority Stockholders after a Conversion Transaction also would be increased by any purchases by Minority Stockholders in the stock offering conducted as part of the Conversion Transaction. Under a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to Lake Shore, MHC, Minority Stockholders would not be diluted because of any dividends waived by Lake Shore, MHC (and waived dividends would not be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio), in the event Lake Shore, MHC converts to stock form.
 ﻿
 Any Conversion Transaction would be subject to approvals by Minority Stockholders and members of Lake Shore, MHC.

Liquidation Rights. Each depositor of Lake Shore Savings has both a deposit account in Lake Shore Savings and a pro rata ownership interest in the net worth of Lake Shore, MHC based upon the deposit balance in his or her account.  This ownership interest is tied to the depositor’s account and has no tangible market value separate from the deposit account.  This interest may only be realized in the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of Lake Shore Savings.  Any depositor who opens a deposit account obtains a pro rata ownership interest in Lake Shore, MHC without any additional payment beyond the amount of the deposit.  A depositor who reduces or closes his or her account (including reductions to pay for shares of common stock in the stock offering) receives a portion or all, respectively, of the balance in the deposit account but nothing for his or her ownership interest in the net worth of Lake Shore, MHC, which is lost to the extent that the balance in the account is reduced or closed.
     In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of Lake Shore Savings, all claims of creditors of Lake Shore Savings, including those of depositors of Lake Shore Savings (to the extent of their deposit balances), would be paid first.  Thereafter, if there were any assets of Lake Shore Savings remaining, these assets would be distributed to Lake Shore Bancorp as Lake Shore Savings’ sole stockholder.  Then, if there were any assets of Lake Shore Bancorp remaining, depositors of Lake Shore Savings would receive those remaining assets, pro rata, based upon the deposit balances in their deposit account in Lake Shore Savings immediately prior to liquidation.
