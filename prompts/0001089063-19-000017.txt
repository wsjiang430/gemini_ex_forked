ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, referred to as "the Company", "we", "us" and "our" unless specified otherwise) is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories through a blend of dedicated associates, in-store services and unique specialty shop-in-shops. The Company also owns and operates Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream stores, and Dick's Team Sports HQ, an all-in-one youth sports digital platform offering scheduling, communications and live scorekeeping through its GameChanger mobile apps, free league management services, custom uniforms and fan wear, and access to donations and sponsorships. The Company offers its products through a content-rich eCommerce platform that is integrated with its store network and provides customers with the convenience and expertise of a 24-hour storefront. 
The Company was founded in 1948 when Richard "Dick" Stack, the father of Edward W. Stack, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, opened his original bait and tackle store in Binghamton, New York. Edward W. Stack joined his father's business full-time in 1977 and in 1984 became President and Chief Executive Officer of the then two-store chain. Our vision is to be the best sports company in the world. We create confidence and excitement by personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams.

We were incorporated in 1948 in New York under the name Dick's Clothing and Sporting Goods, Inc. In November 1997, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and in April 1999 we changed our name to Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. Our executive office is located at 345 Court Street, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania 15108 and our phone number is (724) 273-3400. Our website is located at dicks.com. The information on our website does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We include on our website, free of charge, copies of our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, any reference to "year" is to the Company's fiscal year.
Business Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are:
Focus on Our Customer. Our first priority is to put the customer, to whom we refer as athletes, at the center of everything that we do. We believe that our mindset and our culture must ensure that every decision we make, whether in our stores or at our Customer Support Center ("CSC"), improves the athlete’s experience. We will continue to make investments that enhance our store experience, improve our eCommerce fulfillment capabilities and implement technology solutions that improve the athlete experience as well as teammate productivity.
Our marketing program is designed to build loyalty for the Dick’s Sporting Goods brand while promoting our broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment, apparel and footwear in a specialty store environment.  Our historical marketing strategy has consisted largely of newspaper advertising supplemented by direct mail and seasonal use of local and national television and radio.  While we continue to market through these traditional channels, we have more recently developed brand-building marketing campaigns focused on building passion and loyalty to the Dick’s Sporting Goods brand and have shifted our advertising focus toward digital marketing and personalization.  We continue to leverage our extensive and expanding customer relationship marketing database from our ScoreCard Rewards program.  The Company continues to grow its community presence through Team Sports HQ and sponsoring thousands of teams at the local level.
We continue to offer our Best Price Guarantee as a promise to our customers that if they find a lower price than ours, we will match it. We also continue to enhance our ScoreCard loyalty program to make it more rewarding to our customers. At the end of fiscal 2017, we discontinued our practice of expiring accrued ScoreCard points at year-end and moved to a rolling 12-month expiration policy. We believe this will reduce customer frustration and will provide us an opportunity to drive customers back to us after they earn points by shopping with us during the holiday season. We also launched a new tier of our ScoreCard loyalty program during 2018 that better rewards our best customers for their loyalty to us.
Authentic Sporting Goods Retailer. Our history and core foundation is as a retailer of high-quality authentic athletic equipment, apparel and footwear, which is intended to enhance our customers' performance and enjoyment of athletic pursuits, rather than focusing our merchandise selection on the latest fashion trend or style. We believe our customers seek genuine, deep product offerings, and that ultimately this merchandising approach positions us with advantages in the market, which we believe will continue to benefit from new product offerings with enhanced technological features.
Our objective is not only to carry leading brands, but to carry a full range of products within each category, including premium items for the sports enthusiast. We believe that the breadth of our product selections in each category of sporting goods offers our customers a wide range of good, better and best price points and enables us to address the needs of sporting goods consumers, from the beginner to the sports enthusiast, which distinguishes us from other large format sporting goods stores. We also believe that the range of merchandise and extensive in-store support services that we offer allows us to differentiate and compete effectively against all of our competitors, from traditional independent sporting goods stores and specialty shops to other large format sporting goods stores and mass merchant discount retailers to internet-based retailers. 
Drive Omni-channel Growth. At the core of our omni-channel business are our stores. We believe when our customers connect with the Dick's Sporting Goods brand they expect a seamless shopping experience, regardless of the manner in which they choose to shop with us. We continue to see growth in the number of customers who shop with us both online and in our stores and believe these omni-channel customers represent the future of retail.

We plan to continue investing to improve the functionality and performance of our eCommerce site, including a faster and more convenient checkout, improved page responsiveness and new content development through our Pro Tips platform. We believe our biggest opportunity to continue improving our online experience is through faster and more reliable delivery. We plan to open two new eCommerce fulfillment centers in New York and California during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which will enable us to deliver the majority of our online orders within two business days by the end of fiscal 2019. Like our customers, we see retail as an omni-channel experience, where the distinctions between stores and online are becoming increasingly irrelevant. 
We believe our store base gives us a competitive advantage over our online-only competitors, as our physical presence allows us to better serve our customers by creating strong engagement through experiential elements, offering the convenience of accepting in-store returns or exchanges and expediting fulfillment of eCommerce orders. We believe that offering support services for the products we sell enhances the credibility of our associates and specialty store concepts with our customers and further differentiates our stores from our competitors. 
Differentiating Dick's Sporting Goods. Our key partners invest in our stores to showcase their brands. We carry a wide variety of well-known brands, including adidas, Asics, Brooks, Callaway Golf, Columbia, Easton, Nike, TaylorMade, The North Face, Titleist, Under Armour and Yeti. We seek to leverage our partnerships to offer authenticity and credibility to our customers, while differentiating ourselves from our competitors. Our brand partnerships also provide us with access to exclusive products and allow us to differentiate our customers' shopping experience through initiatives such as our brand shops, which provide our customers with a wider and deeper selection of products from our key brands.
To provide differentiation in assortment of products when compared to our competitors, we also offer a wide variety of private brand products that are not available from other retailers. Our exclusive private brand offerings include brands that we own such as Alpine Design, CALIA, ETHOS, Field & Stream, Fitness Gear, Lady Hagen, MAXFLI, Nishiki, Quest, Second Skin, Tommy Armour, Top-Flite and Walter Hagen, as well as brands that we license from third parties including adidas baseball and football, Reebok (performance apparel), Slazenger (golf) and Prince (tennis). Our private brands offer exceptional value and quality to our customers, while also providing the Company with higher gross margins than we obtain on sales of comparable third-party branded products. We consider our private brand strategy to be a key area of opportunity to increase productivity in our stores and online, and have invested in a research, development and procurement staff to support our private brand business. Looking forward, we intend to grow the CALIA line of women's athletic apparel and introduce new private brands during fiscal 2019. Private brand sales represented approximately 14%, 12% and 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Company is also actively involved in local communities, sponsoring thousands of teams in various sports, and supports the philanthropic efforts of its private corporate foundation, The Dick's Sporting Goods Foundation, whose primary mission is to inspire and enable youth sports participation through the Sports Matter program. The Dick's Team Sports HQ business, which is primarily comprised of Blue Sombrero, Affinity Sports, GameChanger and AD Starr, is focused on creating a holistic digital eco-system to support and equip youth sports and establish relationships with millions of players. We plan to use Dick's Team Sports HQ to stay top-of-mind for athletes and their families, and to create a powerful dataset that we will use to develop offers that are tailored and timed to meet the needs of these athletes.

Segment information is further described within Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Selling Channels
We offer products to our customers through our retail stores and online. Although we sell through both of these channels, we believe that sales in one channel are not independent of the other. Regardless of the sales channel, we seek to provide our customers with a seamless omni-channel shopping experience.
Retail Stores:
Store Format. Each of our Dick's Sporting Goods stores unites several sports specialty stores under one roof, and typically contains the following specialty shops: Team Sports, Athletic Apparel, Golf, Outdoor Lodge, Fitness and Footwear. We believe our "store-within-a-store" concept creates a unique shopping environment by combining the convenience, broad assortment and competitive prices of large format stores with the brand names, deep product selection and customer service of a specialty store. Our Dick's Sporting Goods, Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream stores are designed to create an exciting and interactive shopping environment for the sporting enthusiast that highlights our extensive product assortments and value-added services.
We seek to expand our presence through the opening of new stores, and believe that growing our store network and eCommerce business simultaneously will enable us to profitably grow the business by delivering an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers. We plan to continue a reduced rate of store growth compared to historical levels as we monitor the competitive retail landscape and focus our store growth in under-served and under-penetrated markets. In fiscal 2019, we expect to open approximately seven new Dick's Sporting Goods stores and two new Golf Galaxy stores, which represents a slight reduction from 2018. Additionally, we plan to relocate three Dick's Sporting Goods stores and one Golf Galaxy store. We do not plan to open any new Field & Stream stores in 2019. Approximately two-thirds of our Dick’s Sporting Goods stores will be up for lease renewal at our option over the next five years. We plan to leverage the significant flexibility within our existing real estate portfolio to capitalize on future real estate opportunities over the near and intermediate term as these leases come up for renewal. 
eCommerce:
Through our websites, we seek to provide our customers with in-depth product information and the ability to shop with us at any time. In recent years, the Company has continued to innovate its eCommerce sites and applications with customer experience enhancements, new releases of its mobile and tablet apps, and the development of omni-channel capabilities that integrate the Company's online presence with its brick and mortar stores to provide our customers with an omni-channel shopping experience. Currently, we have return-to-store capabilities for online orders, the ability to place online orders in our stores if we are out of stock in the retail store and buy online pick-up in-store capabilities. We also have the ability through our websites to ship orders placed online from our retail locations, which reduces delivery times for online orders and improves inventory productivity. In fiscal 2018, eCommerce accounted for approximately 15% of our total net sales.
Purchasing, Distribution and Customer Fulfillment
During fiscal 2018, we purchased merchandise from approximately 1,200 vendors. Nike, our largest vendor, represented approximately 19% of our merchandise purchases. No other vendor represented 10% or more of our fiscal 2018 merchandise purchases. We do not have long-term purchase contracts with any of our vendors and all of our purchases from vendors are made on a short-term purchase order basis.
We currently operate five regional distribution centers to supply stores with merchandise. Vendors ship floor-ready merchandise to our distribution centers, where it is processed and allocated directly to our stores or to temporary storage at our distribution centers. Our distribution centers are responsible for consolidating damaged or defective merchandise from our stores that is being returned to vendors. We have contracted with common carriers to deliver merchandise from all of our distribution centers to our stores. During fiscal 2018, our stores received approximately 92% of merchandise through our distribution network with the remaining merchandise being shipped directly to the stores from our vendors. We believe this flow of merchandise facilitates prompt and efficient distribution to our stores in order to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve our inventory turns.

We leverage our store and distribution center network, a third-party operated fulfillment center and direct shipping capabilities from our vendors to ensure merchandise delivery speed to our customers and to minimize shipping costs. 
Competition
The market for sporting goods retailers is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We compete with many retailing formats, including large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores, specialty and vendor stores, mass merchants and department stores, internet and catalog-based retailers, and vendors selling directly to consumers. We seek to attract customers by offering a wide range of products utilizing distinctive marketing in stores to create a unique shopping environment and superior service through an omni-channel experience.
Employees
As of February 2, 2019, we employed approximately 15,200 full-time and 25,500 part-time associates. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, total employment figures fluctuate throughout the year and typically peak during the fourth quarter. None of our associates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our associates are good.

Our licenses are also subject to general risks and uncertainties common to licensing arrangements that are described within Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
Governmental Regulations
We must comply with various federal, state and local regulations, including regulations relating to consumer products and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy, intellectual property, the environment and tax. In addition, in connection with the sale of firearms in our stores, we must comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to the sale of firearms and ammunition, including the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Ensuring our compliance with these various laws and regulations, and keeping abreast of changes to the legal and regulatory landscape present in our industry, requires us to expend considerable resources.
