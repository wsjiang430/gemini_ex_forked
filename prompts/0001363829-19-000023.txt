ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Company Overview
Enstar Group Limited ("Enstar") is a Bermuda-based holding company, formed in 2001. Enstar is a multi-faceted insurance group that offers innovative capital release solutions and specialty underwriting capabilities through its network of group companies in Bermuda, the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Australia, and other international locations. Enstar is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "ESGR". In this report, the terms "Enstar," "the Company," "us," and "we" are used interchangeably to describe Enstar and our subsidiary companies.
Our fundamental corporate objective is growing our net book value per share. We strive to achieve this primarily through growth in net earnings from both organic and accretive sources, including the completion of new acquisitions, the effective management of companies and portfolios of business acquired, and the execution of active underwriting strategies.
Enstar acquires and manages insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run-off. Since formation, we have completed the acquisition of over 90 insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios of business.
Enstar also manages specialty active underwriting businesses:

• | Atrium Underwriting Group Limited and its subsidiaries ("Atrium"), which manage and underwrite specialist insurance and reinsurance business for Lloyd’s Syndicate 609; and


• | StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited and its subsidiaries ("StarStone"), which is an A.M. Best A- rated global specialty insurance group with multiple underwriting platforms.

Business Strategy
Enstar aims to maximize growth in net book value per share by employing the following strategies:
We Leverage Management’s Experience and Industry Relationships to Solidify Enstar’s Position in the Run-Off Market.  Enstar leverages the extensive experience and relationships of our senior management team to solidify our position as a leading run-off acquirer and generate future growth opportunities.
We Engage in Highly Disciplined Acquisition Practices. Enstar is highly selective and disciplined when assessing potential acquisition targets, carefully analyzing risk exposures, claims practices and reserve requirements as part of a detailed due diligence process.  We believe this decreases risk and increases the probability that we can deliver positive operating results from the companies and portfolios acquired.
We Aim to Profitably Underwrite Selected Specialty Lines to Enhance Future Growth Opportunities.  Through our Atrium and StarStone segments, Enstar selectively underwrites in chosen specialty lines, with a focus on balancing risk exposures. Through Atrium and StarStone, the group’s underwriting activity grows organically; and when Enstar acquires run-off businesses, the group’s active underwriting companies are well-positioned to capture profitable active business in specialty lines previously identified as attractive.
We Manage Claims Professionally, Expeditiously, and Cost-Effectively. Enstar aims to manage claims in a professional and disciplined manner, drawing on in-house expertise to dispose of claims efficiently. Enstar strives to pay valid claims on a timely basis, while relying on well-documented policy terms and exclusions where applicable, and litigation when necessary, to defend against paying invalid claims.
We Seek to Commute Assumed Liabilities and Insurance and Reinsurance Assets at a Discount to the Ultimate Liability. Using detailed claims analysis and actuarial projections, Enstar seeks to negotiate with policyholders with a goal of commuting existing insurance and reinsurance liabilities at a discount to the ultimate liability.
We Prudently Manage Investments and Capital. In managing investments and deploying group capital, Enstar strives to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns, while growing profitability and generating long-term growth in shareholder value.
Strategic Growth
Enstar transactions typically take the form of either acquisitions or portfolio transfers. In an acquisition, we acquire an insurance or reinsurance company and manage the run-off or continued underwriting of risk in its business lines. In a portfolio transfer, a reinsurance contract transfers risk from the initial insurance or reinsurance company to a company in the Enstar group. Enstar also enters into reinsurance to close ("RITC") transactions with Lloyd's of London ("Lloyd's") insurance and reinsurance syndicates in run-off, whereby a portfolio of run-off liabilities is transferred from one Lloyd’s syndicate to another.
The substantial majority of Enstar’s acquisitions have been in the non-life run-off business, which generally includes property and casualty, workers’ compensation, asbestos and environmental, construction defect, marine, aviation and transit, and other closed business. Enstar evolved from a stand-alone run-off consolidator to a more diversified insurance group with active underwriting capabilities following our acquisitions of Atrium and StarStone, in 2013 and 2014, respectively. We partnered with the Trident V funds ("Trident") (managed by Stone Point Capital LLC) in the acquisitions of the active underwriting businesses. Stone Point Capital is a financial services-focused private equity firm that has significant experience investing in insurance and reinsurance companies and other insurance-related businesses, which Enstar believes is valuable in our active underwriting joint ventures. In each of the Atrium and StarStone transactions, Enstar has a 59.0% equity interest, Trident has a 39.3% equity interest, and Dowling Capital Partners, L.P. ("Dowling") has a 1.7% equity interest.
Recent Acquisitions and Significant New Business
Maiden
On March 1, 2019, we entered into a Master Agreement with Maiden Holdings, Ltd. ("Maiden Holdings") and Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. (“Maiden Re Bermuda”). Under the Master Agreement, Enstar and Maiden Re Bermuda agreed to enter into an Adverse Development Cover Reinsurance Agreement (“ADC Agreement”) pursuant to which Maiden Re Bermuda will cede and Enstar will reinsure 100% of the liability of Maiden Re Bermuda, as reinsurer, under Maiden Re Bermuda’s two existing quota share agreements with certain insurance companies owned directly or indirectly by AmTrust Financial Services, Inc.

The premium payable by Maiden Re Bermuda to Enstar under the ADC Agreement is $500.0 million. Completion of the transaction is subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of various closing conditions.

Effective immediately upon the signing of the Master Agreement, the parties terminated and released each other from their respective obligations under the previously disclosed Master Agreement, entered into on November 9, 2018. The previous agreement provided for the parties to enter into a retrocession agreement pursuant to which Maiden Re Bermuda would cede and Enstar would reinsure 100% of the liability of Maiden Re Bermuda, as reinsurer, under Maiden Re Bermuda’s two existing AmTrust quota share agreements for losses incurred on or prior to June 30, 2018, for a premium payable by Maiden Re Bermuda to Enstar of $2.675 billion.

Enstar's subsidiary would assume $60.0 million of net reserves in the transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019, is subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of various other customary closing conditions.

We assumed aggregate net reinsurance reserves of approximately £650.0 million (approximately $830.0 million) for cash consideration approximately equal to the net amount of reserves assumed.
Allianz
Effective December 31, 2018, we and Allianz SE amended the January 1, 2016 reinsurance agreement between our subsidiary and Allianz SE, which related to our reinsurance of certain U.S. workers' compensation, construction defect, and asbestos, pollution and toxic tort business originally held by Fireman's Fund Insurance Company. The amendment increased the original sub-limit related to asbestos & environmental (“A&E”) liabilities in exchange for a premium of $70.0 million. This additional business is also covered by the consulting agreement that we entered into with San Francisco Reinsurance Company, an affiliate of Allianz, in connection with our 2017 transaction with Allianz discussed below. 
Maiden Re North America
On December 27, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Maiden Reinsurance North America, Inc. (“Maiden Re North America”) from a subsidiary of Maiden Holdings. Maiden Re North America is a diversified insurance company domiciled in Missouri that provides property and casualty treaty reinsurance, casualty facultative reinsurance and accident and health treaty reinsurance. The net consideration payable in the transactions was $286.4 million, and we assumed $1.0 billion of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves upon closing. The renewal rights were not included in the transaction.
On December 27, 2018, as part of the acquisition of Maiden Re North America, we also novated and assumed certain reinsurance agreements from Maiden Re Bermuda, including certain affiliate reinsurance agreements with Maiden Re North America. We assumed total gross unaffiliated reserves of $72.1 million for total assets of $70.4 million on a funds held basis and recorded a deferred charge asset of $1.7 million, included in other assets.
Coca-Cola
On August 1, 2018, we entered into a reinsurance transaction with The Coca-Cola Company and its subsidiaries ("Coca-Cola"), pursuant to which we reinsured certain of Coca-Cola's retention and deductible risks under its subsidiaries' U.S. workers' compensation, auto liability, general liability and product liability insurance coverage. We assumed total gross reserves of $120.8 million for cash consideration of $103.6 million and recorded a deferred charge asset of $17.2 million, included in other assets. We transferred the cash consideration of $103.6 million into a trust to support our obligations under the reinsurance agreement.

In consideration for the acquired shares and warrants of KaylaRe, we issued an aggregate of 2,007,017 of our ordinary shares to the shareholders of KaylaRe, comprising 1,501,778 voting ordinary shares and 505,239 Series E non-voting ordinary shares. As a result of this transaction, we recognized goodwill of $41.7 million and net income of $0.4 million due to the remeasurement of the previously held equity method investment to its fair value, partially offset by the settlement of preexisting relationships. For a detailed discussion of various transactions related to KaylaRe and its other shareholders, refer to Note 3 - "Acquisitions" and Note 21 - "Related Party Transactions" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Zurich Australia
On February 23, 2018, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Zurich Australian Insurance Limited, a subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group ("Zurich"), to reinsure its New South Wales Vehicle Compulsory Third Party ("CTP") insurance business. Under the agreement, which was effective January 1, 2018, we assumed gross loss reserves of AUD$359.4 million ($280.8 million) in exchange for consideration of AUD$343.9 million ($268.7 million). We elected the fair value option for this reinsurance contract and recorded an initial fair value adjustment of AUD$15.5 million ($12.1 million) on the assumed gross loss reserves. 
Following the initial reinsurance transaction, which transferred the economics of the CTP insurance business, we and Zurich also completed a portfolio transfer of the CTP insurance business under Division 3A Part III of Australia's Insurance Act 1973 (Cth), effective December 31, 2018, which provided legal finality for Zurich's obligations.

The above table presents the assumed and acquired net reserves in the year they were assumed or acquired in our Non-life Run-off segment, including the impact of any fair value adjustments due to business combinations or electing the fair value option, deferred charge assets and unallocated LAE. The table also presents the cumulative roll forward of those acquired and assumed net reserves from the year of acquisition to December 31, 2018. As such, each acquisition year includes a different number of years and therefore impacts the comparability between acquisition years. We generally do not experience significant favourable or adverse development on acquired or assumed net reserves in the year of acquisition. After the first year, and following detailed reviews of all open claims, we primarily earn our total return from disciplined claims management and/or commuting the liabilities and maximizing reinsurance recoveries, in addition to maximizing investment returns on the investment portfolio. 
Other Transactions 
Enhanzed Re
Enhanzed Reinsurance Ltd. ("Enhanzed Re") is a joint venture between Enstar, Allianz SE and Hillhouse Capital Management, Ltd. ("Hillhouse Capital") that was entered into in December 2018. Enhanzed Re is a Bermuda-based Class 4 and Class E reinsurer and will reinsure life, non-life run-off, and property and casualty insurance business. Enstar, Allianz and an affiliate of Hillhouse Capital have made equity investment commitments in the aggregate of $470.0 million to Enhanzed Re. Enstar owns 47.4% of the entity, with Allianz owning 24.9%, and an affiliate of Hillhouse owning 27.7%. As of December 31, 2018, Enstar had contributed $94.8 million of its equity commitment to Enhanzed Re, and its uncalled commitment was $128.0 million.
Enstar acts as the (re)insurance manager for Enhanzed Re, Hillhouse is the primary investment manager and an affiliate of Allianz SE also provides investment management services. Enhanzed Re intends to write business sourced from Allianz SE and Enstar, and it will seek to underwrite other business to maximize diversification by risk and geography.
AmTrust
In November 2018, we purchased equity in Evergreen Parent, L.P. ("Evergreen") in the aggregate amount of $200.0 million. Evergreen is an entity formed by private equity funds managed by Stone Point and the Karfunkel-Zyskind family that acquired the approximately 45% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. ("AmTrust") that the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and certain of its affiliates and related parties did not already own or control. The equity interest was in the form of three separate classes of equity securities issued at the same price and in the same proportion as the equity interest purchased by Trident Pine Acquisition L.P. ("Trident Pine"). Following the closing of the transaction, Enstar owns approximately 7.5% of the equity interest in Evergreen and Trident Pine owns approximately 21.8%. Evergreen owns all of the equity interest in AmTrust.
Sale of Life and Annuities
The following sections describe the sale of various life and annuities businesses and assets, certain of which are still underway. Each of these was an opportunistic sale, allowing us to release capital and liquidity. The proceeds will be used to repay our credit facilities and for Non-life Run-off transactions. We will still consider life and annuities business opportunities, either for our own balance sheet, or via one of our affiliates, Monument Re or Enhanzed Re. 
Alpha
On October 10, 2018, we entered into a Business Transfer Agreement between our wholly-owned subsidiary Alpha Insurance SA ("Alpha") and a subsidiary of Monument Insurance Group Limited ("Monument"). This agreement will transfer our remaining life assurance policies to Monument, via a portfolio transfer, subject to regulatory approval. The transaction is expected to close during 2019. We have an equity method investment in Monument, as described further in Note 21 - "Related Party Transactions" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our remaining life operations do not qualify for inclusion in our reportable segments and are therefore included within other activities. The related assets, as well as the results from these operations, were not significant to our consolidated operations and therefore they have not been classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, our proposed transfer of these life assurance polices to Monument was not classified as a held-for-sale business transaction since the underlying contracts do not meet the definition of a business.
Life Settlements
During 2018, we sold our investments in life settlement contracts. Our life settlement investments do not qualify for inclusion in our reportable segments and therefore were included within other activities. The related assets, as well as the results from these operations, were not significant to our consolidated operations and therefore they were not been classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, our sale of these investments was not classified as a held-for-sale business transaction since the underlying contracts did not meet the definition of a business.
Pavonia
On December 29, 2017, we completed the sale of Pavonia Holdings (US), Inc. (“Pavonia”) to Southland National Holdings, Inc. (“Southland”), a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Global Bankers Insurance Group, LLC. The aggregate purchase price was $120.0 million. We used the proceeds to make repayments under our revolving credit facility. A sale of one subsidiary, Pavonia Life Insurance Company of New York ("PLIC NY") has not yet completed. We classified the assets and liabilities of the business to be sold as held-for-sale.
Operating Segments
We have three reportable segments of business that are each managed, operated and separately reported: (i) Non-life Run-off; (ii) Atrium; and (iii) StarStone. Our other activities, which do not qualify as a reportable segment, include our corporate expenses, debt servicing costs, holding company income and expenses, foreign exchange, our remaining life business and other miscellaneous items. For additional information and financial data relating to our segments, see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations by Segment," "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments" and Note 24 - "Segment Information" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Non-life Run-off
Our Non-life Run-off segment comprises the operations of our subsidiaries that are running off their property and casualty and other non-life lines of business.
In the primary (or direct) insurance business, the insurer assumes risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the given risks. In the reinsurance business, the reinsurer agrees to indemnify an insurance or reinsurance company, referred to as the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance risks arising under the policies the ceding company has written or reinsured. When an insurer or reinsurer stops writing new insurance business, either entirely or with respect to a particular line of business, the insurer, reinsurer, or the line of discontinued business is in run-off.
Participants in the industry often have portfolios of business that become inconsistent with their core competency or provide excessive exposure to a particular risk or segment of the market (i.e., workers' compensation, property/casualty, asbestos, environmental, director and officer liability, etc.). These non-core and/or discontinued portfolios are often associated with potentially large exposures and lengthy time periods before resolution of the last remaining insured claims, resulting in significant uncertainty to the insurer or reinsurer covering those risks. These factors can distract management, drive up the cost of capital and surplus for the insurer or reinsurer and negatively impact the insurer’s or reinsurer’s rating, which makes the disposal of the unwanted company or portfolio an attractive option. The insurer or reinsurer may engage with a third party that specializes in run-off management, such as Enstar, to purchase the company or assume the portfolio in run-off.
In the sale of a company in run-off, a purchaser, such as Enstar, may pay a discount to the book value of the company based on the risks assumed and the relative value to the seller of no longer having to manage the company in run-off. Such a transaction can be beneficial to the seller because it receives an up-front payment for the company, eliminates the need for its management to devote any attention to the disposed company and removes the risk that the established reserves related to the run-off business may prove to be inadequate. The seller is also able to redeploy its management and financial resources to its core businesses.
In some situations, an insurer or reinsurer may wish to divest itself of a portfolio of non-core legacy business that may have been underwritten alongside other ongoing core business that the insurer or reinsurer does not want to dispose of. In such instances, we are able to provide economic finality for the insurer or reinsurer by providing a loss portfolio reinsurance contract to protect the insurer or reinsurer against deterioration of the non-core portfolio of loss reserves.
Overall, the focus of our Non-life Run-off segment is to acquire companies or portfolios in run-off and to effectively manage that business in ways that further our primary corporate objective of growing Enstar's net book value per share.
Acquisition Process
We evaluate each acquisition and loss portfolio transfer opportunity presented by carefully reviewing the portfolio’s risk exposures, claim practices, reserve requirements and outstanding claims. Based on this initial analysis, we can determine if a company or portfolio of business would add value to our current portfolio of run-off businesses. If we decide to pursue the purchase of a company in run-off, we then proceed to price the acquisition in a manner we believe will result in positive operating results based on certain assumptions including, without limitation, our ability to favorably resolve claims, negotiate with direct insureds and reinsurers, and otherwise manage the nature of the risks posed by the business.
At the time we acquire a company in run-off, we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired based on actuarial advice and our views of the exposures assumed. We primarily earn our total return on an acquisition from disciplined claims management and/or commuting the liabilities that we have assumed, maximizing reinsurance recoveries on the assumed portfolio of business and investment returns from the acquired investment portfolios.
Run-off Management
Following the acquisition of a company or portfolio of business in run-off, we strive to conduct the run-off in a disciplined and professional manner to efficiently discharge the liabilities associated with the business while preserving and maximizing its assets. Our approach to managing our companies and portfolios of business in run-off includes, where possible, negotiating with third-party insureds and reinsureds to commute their insurance or reinsurance agreement (sometimes called policy buy-backs for direct insurance) for an agreed upon up-front payment by us and to more efficiently manage payment of insurance and reinsurance claims. We attempt to commute policies with direct insureds or reinsureds to eliminate uncertainty over the amount of future claims. Commutations and policy buy-backs provide an opportunity for the company to exit exposures to certain policies and insureds generally at a discount to the ultimate liability and provide the ability to eliminate exposure to further losses. Commutations can also reduce the duration, administrative burden and ultimately the future cost of the run-off.
In certain lines of business, such as direct workers’ compensation insurance, commutations and policy buy-back opportunities are not typically available, and our strategy with respect to these businesses is to derive value through efficient and effective management of claims.
Integral to our success is our ability to analyze, administer, and settle claims while managing related expenses, such as loss adjustment expenses ("LAE"). We have implemented claims handling guidelines along with claims reporting and control procedures in all of our claims units. All claims matters are reviewed regularly, with all material claims matters being circulated to and authorized by management prior to any action being taken. Our claims management processes also include leveraging our extensive relationships and developed protocols to more efficiently manage outside counsel and other third parties to reduce expenses. With respect to certain lines of business, we have agreements with third-party administrators to manage and pay claims on our subsidiaries’ behalf and advise with respect to case reserves. These agreements generally set forth the duties of the third-party administrators, limits of authority, indemnification language designed for our protection and various procedures relating to compliance with laws and regulations. These arrangements are also subject to review by our relevant claims departments, and we monitor these administrators on an ongoing basis.
We provide consultancy services to third parties in the insurance and reinsurance industry primarily through our subsidiaries, the Cranmore companies, Enstar Limited, Enstar (US), Inc., Paladin Managed Care Services, Inc. ("Paladin") and Kinsale Brokers Limited. In addition to third-party engagements, our consultancy companies also perform these services in-house for our Enstar companies, using their expertise to assist in managing our run-off portfolios and performing certain due diligence matters relating to acquired businesses. The services range from full-service incentive-based or fixed fee run-off management to bespoke solutions such as claims inspection, claims validation, reinsurance asset collection and IT consulting services. Paladin provides medical bill review, utilization review, physician case management and related services in the workers’ compensation area. 
Following the acquisition of a company or the assumption of a portfolio of business through a reinsurance transaction, we analyze the acquired exposures and reinsurance receivables on a policyholder-by-policyholder basis to identify those we wish to approach to discuss commutation. In addition, policyholders and reinsurers often approach us requesting commutation. We then carry out a full analysis of the underlying exposures in order to determine the attractiveness of a proposed commutation. From the initial analysis of the underlying exposures, it may take several months, or even years, before a commutation is completed. In certain cases, if we and the policyholder or reinsurer are unable to reach a commercially acceptable settlement, the commutation may not be achievable, in which case we will continue to settle valid claims from the policyholder, or collect reinsurance receivables from the reinsurer, as they arise or become due.
Certain insureds and reinsureds are often willing to commute with us, subject to receiving an acceptable settlement, as this provides certainty of recovery of what otherwise may be claims that are disputed in the future, and often provides a meaningful up-front cash receipt that, with the associated investment income, can provide funds to meet future claim payments or even commutation of their underlying exposure. Therefore, subject to negotiating an acceptable settlement, many of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables can be either commuted or settled by way of policy buy-back over time. Properly priced commutations may reduce the expense of adjusting direct claims and pursuing collection of reinsurance, realize savings, remove the potential future volatility of claims and reduce required regulatory capital.
We manage cash flow with regard to reinsurance recoverables by working with reinsurers, brokers and professional advisors to achieve fair and prompt payment of reinsured claims, and we take appropriate legal action to secure receivables when necessary. We also attempt where appropriate to negotiate favorable commutations with our reinsurers by securing a lump sum settlement from reinsurers in complete satisfaction of the reinsurer’s past, present and future liability in respect of such claims.
As a result of the number of transactions we have completed over the years, our organizational structure consists of licensed entities across many jurisdictions. In managing our group, we continue to look for opportunities to simplify our legal structure by way of company amalgamations and mergers, reinsurance, or other transactions to improve capital efficiency and decrease ongoing compliance and operational costs over time. In addition, we seek to pool risk in areas where we maintain the expertise to manage such risk to achieve operational efficiencies, which allows us to most efficiently manage our assets to achieve capital diversification benefits.
In early 2019, we have completed or signed agreements for six portfolios of non-life run-off business. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities and we expect further significant transaction activity in the future. 
Atrium
Our Atrium segment is comprised of the active underwriting operations and financial results of Northshore Holdings Ltd. ("Northshore"), a holding company that owns Atrium and its subsidiaries and Arden. Enstar acquired Atrium on November 25, 2013.
Atrium’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Atrium Underwriters Ltd, manages Syndicate 609, which underwrites specialist insurance and reinsurance business at Lloyd’s. Atrium’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Atrium 5 Ltd., provides 25% of the underwriting capacity and capital to Syndicate 609, with the balance provided by traditional Lloyd’s Names. Atrium has offices in London, the United States, Canada and Singapore. Generally, Atrium continues to operate in accordance with the underwriting and other business strategies established pre-acquisition, although we and Trident continually review these strategies and business goals and continue to develop synergies with our existing business operations.
Arden is a Bermuda-based reinsurance company that provides reinsurance to Atrium (through a 65% quota share reinsurance arrangement with Atrium 5 Ltd., which is eliminated upon consolidation) and is currently in the process of running off certain other discontinued business. Results related to Arden’s discontinued business are included within our Non-life Run-off segment.
Business Lines 
Syndicate 609 provides insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis including the United States, Europe, the Far East and Australasia. Atrium specializes in a wide range of industry classes, including marine, aviation and transit, property and casualty binding authorities, reinsurance, accident and health and non-marine direct and facultative. Lloyd’s business is often underwritten on a subscription basis across the insurance market. Atrium is the lead underwriter in approximately 43% of the business it underwrites.
Lloyd’s is a surplus lines insurer and an accredited reinsurer in all U.S. states and territories, and a licensed (or admitted) insurer in Illinois, Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
A description of each of Atrium's lines of business follows:
Marine, Aviation and Transit. The marine line of business is a worldwide portfolio writing marine hull, marine war, cargo, fine art and specie, marine and energy liability and total loss only business. Atrium leads a number of the major marine war contracts in London. Business is written on a direct, reinsurance, proportional and excess of loss basis. The aviation portfolio includes all aspects of aviation insurance, with Atrium specializing in rotor wing and non-major airlines. The majority of the account is sourced through London brokers as direct or facultative reinsurance of a local reinsurer. Included within the marine, aviation and transit lines of business are the upstream energy and terrorism portfolios. The upstream energy portfolio is split into two main categories of assureds: operators (private and publicly quoted companies, national oil companies and Oil Insurance Limited members) and contractors (drilling, service and construction companies). The principal coverage is physical damage/business interruption, control of well and associated pollution, construction and Gulf of Mexico windstorm and other natural catastrophe perils. Nearly all of the upstream energy line of business is sourced through Lloyd’s brokers, with the significant majority written on a facultative basis and a smaller amount written on a treaty basis. The terrorism portfolio includes political violence business, in which Atrium focuses on writing with security consultants engaged to provide risk or country surveys.
Binding Authorities. The property and casualty binding authority portfolio includes a broad range of small and medium business entity insurance products offered across the United States and Canada. Typical property risks include commercial, vacant and hard-to-place residential dwellings. Typical casualty risks include owners, landlords and tenants, business owners, artisan, special events and various niche products. Business is written through both traditional binding authorities as well as online binding authorities through AUGold, Atrium’s proprietary online system that is used by brokers. The liability line of business includes a professional liability North American portfolio of products covering a diverse range of classes including architects, consultants and lawyers and also a miscellaneous range encompassing many different professions. Included within this line of business is international liability, which is a book of primary coverholder business covering the security, leisure and hotel industries. The majority of business is produced through delegated binding authority contracts.
Reinsurance. The reinsurance line is a worldwide portfolio and includes aviation reinsurance, casualty reinsurance, property reinsurance, and marine reinsurance. Business is mainly written on a risk excess of loss, catastrophe excess of loss or retrocessional basis. Aviation reinsurance is written through an underwriting consortium managed by Atrium.
Accident and Health. The accident and health line is a global account that encompasses a wide range of classes, including group and individual disability, personal accident, travel insurance, medical expenses, aviation personal accident, war risks, kidnap and ransom insurance, and sports accident insurance. The line includes both insurance and reinsurance business, written as facultative placements and under delegated underwriting facilities and both proportional and non-proportional treaties.
Non-Marine Direct and Facultative. The non-marine direct and facultative portfolio includes a diverse mix of property business offered in both the international and U.S. markets, comprised of physical loss or damage, business interruption, extra expense, construction, contingency and pecuniary loss risks in respect of onshore property and onshore engineered risks. The majority of this line of business is written through Lloyd’s brokers and under delegated underwriting facilities.
Distribution
All of the business in the Atrium segment is placed through insurance and reinsurance brokers, and a key distribution channel for Syndicate 609 is the managing general agent binding authorities. Atrium seeks to develop relationships with insurance and reinsurance brokers, insurance and reinsurance companies, large global corporations and financial intermediaries to develop and underwrite business. Independent broker Marsh Inc. accounted for 11% of Atrium’s gross premiums written in 2018. Other brokers (each individually less than 10%) accounted for the remaining 89% of gross premiums written.
Atrium’s proprietary online platform, AUGold, provides end-to-end processing, quote and policy production for managing general agents across a range of classes of business.  The platform provides agents with efficient and cost effective access to Lloyd’s binding authorities and is designed to enable Atrium to compete more effectively with North American excess and surplus lines carriers.
Managing Agency Services
Atrium receives a managing agency fee of 0.7% of Syndicate 609 capacity and a 20% profit commission based on the net earnings of Syndicate 609, pursuant to its management contract. Atrium also receives management fees and profit commission from the management of underwriting consortiums. These fees and profit commission are included within fees and commission income in our consolidated statement of earnings.
Claims Management
Claims in respect of business written by Syndicate 609 are primarily notified by various central market bureaus. Where a syndicate is a "leading" syndicate on a Lloyd’s policy, its underwriters and claims adjusters work directly with the broker or insured on behalf of itself and the following market for any particular claim. This may involve appointing attorneys or loss adjusters. The claims bureaus and the leading syndicate advise movement in loss reserves to all syndicates participating on the risk. If necessary, Atrium's claims department may adjust the case reserves it records from those advised by the bureaus.
Reinsurance Ceded
On an annual basis Atrium purchases a tailored outwards reinsurance program designed to manage its risk profile. The majority of Atrium’s third-party reinsurance cover is with Lloyd’s Syndicates or other highly rated reinsurers.
StarStone
Our StarStone segment is comprised of the active underwriting operations and financial results of StarStone and StarStone Specialty Holdings Limited ("StarStone Group"), a holding company that owns StarStone and its subsidiaries. Our StarStone segment also includes the results of KaylaRe's reinsurance of StarStone Group from the date that Enstar completed the acquisition of KaylaRe and other intra-group cessions.
We acquired StarStone (formerly known as Torus) on April 1, 2014 in partnership with Trident (managed by Stone Point Capital). Dowling also has a minority investment. StarStone’s strategy emphasizes underwriting discipline and focuses on profitable lines and improvement of operational effectiveness and efficiency. 
StarStone is a global specialty insurer operating worldwide from key underwriting hubs in the Lloyd's and London markets, Bermuda, Continental Europe, and the United States. StarStone has five wholly-owned insurance platforms and licenses to serve a global client base. In December 2017, the London market and European business were merged into a single European entity based in Liechtenstein. This was executed in order to improve operational efficiencies and position the StarStone group for any potential post-Brexit issues. Through Syndicate 1301, StarStone offers a variety of specialty products at Lloyd’s. Syndicate 1301 is managed by StarStone's wholly-owned Lloyd’s managing agency. 
Business Lines
StarStone offers a broad range of property, casualty and specialty insurance products to both large multi-national and small and middle-market clients around the world. A description of StarStone's business lines is as follows:
Casualty.  Casualty is StarStone's largest product group, including StarStone’s U.S. excess casualty, global management and professional liability, global healthcare, and accident and health products. The U.S. excess casualty product includes umbrella, excess and retained limit products across a wide range of market segments focused on small to mid-market businesses. The global management and professional liability product specializes in directors and officers and professional liability protection for both traditional and emerging professions. Our healthcare product provides insurance for acute care centers, nursing homes, physician groups, senior living facilities, and others. The accident and health product provides protection for a broad range of groups and individuals such as air crew personal accident and loss of license, accidental death and permanent and temporary disability for individuals including athletes and high net worth individuals.
Marine.    We provide a broad range of marine and specialty products including hull and machinery, marine and energy liabilities, cargo, war, transport, specie and fine art, and terrorism. These products are written through Lloyd's Syndicate 1301, our European branch network and by some of our U.S. based teams. We also provide high excess casualty coverage placed in the London wholesale market which is focused on high excess layers for Fortune 500 companies.
Property.    This line includes all of our property insurance products. The construction portfolio focuses on large, complex, infrastructure and contractor cover across all risk areas. Property also includes our onshore, power, and upstream and offshore products written through our Lloyd's and London platforms. Most lines are written on a full value, primary, excess of loss or quota share basis.
Aerospace.    We serve a diverse client base within the aerospace sector including airlines, aircraft manufacturers and airport service providers. Our products are split between short-tail and long-tail risks and by aircraft type into three areas: airlines, aviation products and liability, and general aviation.
Workers' compensation.    This line provides workers' compensation solutions for a range of industries, including energy and maritime businesses to high-hazard operations. We also cover cross-state, multi-jurisdictional exposures in single policies. Business is written directly with clients and through partnerships with independent agents, managing general underwriters, and select wholesale brokers throughout the United States.
Distribution 
StarStone's distribution strategy is to focus on proximity to clients and brokers, using its Lloyd’s platform, European branch distribution network, its U.S. wholesale distribution strategy, as well as its relationships with insurance and reinsurance brokers and risk carriers, corporations and financial intermediaries. 
Syndicate 1301 can conduct business in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. In addition to underwriting business directly at Lloyd’s in London, it provides local access to Lloyd’s in Continental Europe and the United States. 
In the United States, products are written locally through our admitted and excess and surplus lines carriers. Our U.S. strategy also utilizes our online e-commerce broker portal, ESCAPE, which offers immediate wholesale distribution to all 50 states. 
Business in the StarStone segment is generally placed through insurance and reinsurance brokers and managing general agents. Independent brokers Marsh Inc., Willis Group Holdings Ltd. and Aon Benfield Group Ltd. accounted for 15%, 6% and 4%, respectively, of StarStone’s gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2018 (25% collectively). Other brokers and managing general agents (each individually less than 4%) accounted for the remaining 75% of gross premiums written.
Claims Management 
Claims in respect of business written by Syndicate 1301, as well as in respect of StarStone’s other London market business, are primarily notified by various central market bureaus whereby the leading syndicate or company advise all participants of movement in loss reserves. StarStone’s claims department adjusts bureau claims in respect of coverages where StarStone is the lead underwriter and may choose to adjust the case reserves it records from those advised by the bureaus.
Claims in respect of non-bureau business are handled by StarStone’s experienced claims professionals. StarStone uses claims handling guidelines along with a global claims management system to review, report and administer claims. With respect to certain lines of business, StarStone may use third-party administrators to manage and pay claims on its behalf and advise with respect to case reserves. StarStone also utilizes Enstar’s experience in claims management. 
Reinsurance Ceded 
StarStone purchases an annual tailored outwards reinsurance program designed to manage its risk profile. The majority of StarStone’s third party reinsurance cover is with highly rated reinsurers or is collateralized by letters of credit. Several of the StarStone affiliates previously had entered into a Quota Share Treaty with KaylaRe Ltd. pursuant to which KaylaRe Ltd. reinsured 35% of all business written by these StarStone affiliates for risks attaching from January 1, 2016, net of the StarStone affiliates' reinsurance programs. The portion of this quota share agreement related to U.S. business was not renewed in 2018, and the remainder was not renewed in 2019. On May 14, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares and warrants of KaylaRe, and the results of KaylaRe were included within our consolidated financial statements from that date. The impact of this acquisition and resultant consolidation has made comparability between periods challenging, as discussed in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - StarStone Segment." 
In addition, effective October 1, 2018, StarStone entered into a loss portfolio transfer with an affiliate of Enstar, whereby the Non-life Run-off subsidiary reinsured certain of StarStone's discontinued and discontinuing lines of business. Capital for the loss portfolio transfer was provided by Enstar, Trident and Dowling on a pro-rata basis.
Other activities
Our other activities, which do not qualify as a reportable segment, include our corporate expenses, debt servicing costs, holding company income and expenses, foreign exchange, our remaining life business and other miscellaneous items. Following the sale of our life settlements investments during 2018 and the transfer of our remaining life assurance policies from Alpha to Monument, which is expected to close during 2019, we will have de minimis residual life business in our consolidated operations.
Liability for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
The liability for losses and LAE, also referred to as loss reserves, represents our gross estimates before reinsurance for unpaid reported losses and losses that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR") for our Non-life Run-off, Atrium and StarStone segments. We recognize an asset for the portion of the liability that we expect to recover from reinsurers. LAE reserves include allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE"), and unallocated loss adjustment expenses ("ULAE"). ALAE are linked to the settlement of an individual claim or loss, whereas ULAE are based on our estimates of future costs to administer the claims. IBNR represents reserves for loss and LAE that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. This includes amounts for unreported claims, development on known claims and reopened claims.
We establish reserves for individual claims incurred and reported, as well as IBNR claims.  We use considerable judgment in estimating losses for reported claims on an individual claim basis based upon our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, the severity of the injury or damage, the jurisdiction of the occurrence, the potential for ultimate exposure, the type of loss, and our experience with the line of business and policy provisions relating to the particular type of claim.  We also use considerable judgment to establish reserves for IBNR claims using a variety of generally accepted actuarial methodologies and procedures to estimate the ultimate cost of settling IBNR claims.  See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses" for a description of our loss reserving process.
The estimation of unpaid claim liabilities at any given point in time is subject to a high degree of uncertainty for a number of reasons. A significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk, the occurrence of a loss event, the reporting of the event to an insurance or reinsurance company and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event. Our actuarial methodologies include industry benchmarking which, under certain methodologies, compares the trend of our loss development to that of the industry. To the extent that the trend of our loss development compared to the industry changes in any period, it is likely to have an impact on the estimate of ultimate liabilities. Unpaid claim liabilities for property and casualty exposures in general are impacted by changes in the legal environment, jury awards, medical cost trends and general inflation. Certain estimates for unpaid claim liabilities involve considerable uncertainty due to significant coverage litigation, and it can be unclear whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience. Ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using reserving techniques that extrapolate losses to an ultimate basis using loss development factors, and the uncertainties surrounding the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities are not likely to be resolved in the near future. In addition, reserves are established to cover loss development related to both known and unasserted claims. Consequently, our subsequent estimates of ultimate losses and LAE, and our liability for losses and LAE, may differ materially from our initial estimates.
In our Non-life Run-off segment, policy buy-backs and commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit and settle exposures to policies with insureds and reinsureds, often at a discount to the previously estimated ultimate liability. Commutations are beneficial to us as they extinguish liabilities, reduce the potential for future adverse loss development, and reduce future claims handling costs. Our estimates of ultimate claim liabilities, including IBNR reserves, are based upon actuarial methodologies applied to the remaining non-commuted aggregate exposures and revised historical loss development information, after adjusting for the elimination of historical loss development relating to commuted and bought-back exposures. In addition, the routine settlement of claims, at either below or above the carried advised loss reserve, updates historical loss development information to which actuarial methodologies are applied often, resulting in revised estimates of ultimate liabilities. A large portion of our loss reserves are related to workers' compensation and casualty exposures, which include latent exposures primarily relating to asbestos and environmental damage. In establishing reserves, we consider facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation. Case reserves are recognized for known claims (including the cost of related litigation) when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy.
Further information regarding the liability for net losses and LAE, including loss development tables and a reconciliation of activity, is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Further information regarding net incurred losses and LAE is included in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations by Segment."
Life Benefits and Claims Reserves
We estimate our life benefit and claim reserves on a present value basis using standard actuarial techniques and cash flow models. We establish and maintain our life reserves at a level that we estimate will, when taken together with future premium payments and investment income expected to be earned on associated premiums, be sufficient to support future cash flow benefit obligations and third-party servicing obligations as they become payable. Our policy benefits for life contracts as at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $105.1 million and $117.2 million, respectively. Following the transfer of our remaining life assurance policies from Alpha to Monument, which is expected to close during 2019, we will have de minimis residual life business in our consolidated operations.
See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Policy Benefits for Life Contracts" for a discussion of these reserves.
Investments
For information regarding our investment strategy, portfolio and results, refer to "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments."
Ratings
In our active underwriting businesses, financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing competitive position and in product marketing. Financial strength ratings by third-party organizations provide an opinion of an insurer’s or reinsurer’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. These ratings reflect A.M. Best’s, Standard and Poor’s ("S&P"), and Fitch Ratings Ltd.’s ("Fitch") opinions of capitalization, performance and management, and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. These ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at the discretion of the agencies. Rating agencies charge fees for their services.
Our Lloyd’s Syndicates 609 (Atrium) and 1301 (StarStone) are part of a group rating for the Lloyd's overall market. Lloyd’s is rated "A" (Excellent) by A.M. Best, "A+" (Strong) by Standard and Poor’s (or S&P) and "AA-" (Very Strong) by Fitch Ratings. 
StarStone’s operating insurance entities have been assigned a financial strength rating of "A-" (Excellent) by A.M. Best. The A.M. Best rating for StarStone of "A-" (Excellent) by A.M. Best is the fourth highest of 16 rating levels. 
Refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Downgrades of financial strength ratings at StarStone or Lloyd’s could materially and negatively impact our active underwriting business and our company," for more information regarding the importance of financial strength ratings.
Competition
Our Non-life Run-off segment competes in international markets with domestic and international reinsurance companies to acquire and manage insurance and reinsurance companies in run-off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run-off. The acquisition and management of companies and portfolios in run-off is highly competitive, and driven by a number of factors, including proposed acquisition price, reputation, and financial resources. Some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do, may have been operating for longer than we have and may have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the insurance and reinsurance industries, which can be a significant competitive advantage. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future for suitable acquisition candidates or run-off portfolio management engagements.
Our Atrium and StarStone active underwriting segments operate in the highly competitive insurance and reinsurance markets, where companies compete on the basis of premium rates, reputation and perceived financial strength, the terms and conditions of the products offered, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payments and quality of administrative services, relationships with insurance and reinsurance companies and insurance intermediaries, capacity and coverage offered, experience in the particular risk to be underwritten, and various other factors.
Atrium and StarStone compete in the international insurance and reinsurance markets directly with numerous other parties, including established global insurance and reinsurance companies, start-up insurance and reinsurance entities, other Lloyd’s syndicates, as well as capital markets and securitization structures aimed at managing risk. Many of these competitors have significant operating histories, underwriting expertise and capacity, extensive capital resources, and longstanding customer relationships. Any of these factors can be a significant competitive advantage and may make it difficult for us to write business effectively and profitably. Because few barriers exist to prevent insurers and reinsurers from entering the non-life active underwriting business, market conditions and capital capacity influence the degree of competition at any given time. For a detailed discussion of competition and the cyclical pattern of the insurance and reinsurance market, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Insurance Businesses." The cyclical market pattern can be more pronounced in the specialty insurance and reinsurance markets in which Atrium and StarStone compete.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,366 employees, as compared to 1,341 as of December 31, 2017. Although our employee count was not significantly changed from last year, we generally do not expect it to be consistent from period to period due to our business strategies, which include anticipated ongoing acquisition and integration activities. 
Enterprise Risk Management 
Effective risk oversight is an important priority for our management and our Boards of Directors (both at the Company level and at a subsidiary level), and we place strong emphasis on ensuring we have a robust risk management framework to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report on risks that affect the achievement of our strategic, operational and financial objectives.
An effective enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework contributes to the strength of our overall group (the "Group"). The value of having effective risk management can positively impact many areas of the business such as setting and achieving business strategy and objectives, capital management decision making, efficiency and effectiveness in operations and processes, financial performance and reliable financial reporting, regulatory compliance, good reputation with key stakeholders and business continuity planning.
Risk Management Strategy
Our risk management strategy is to:

• | engage in highly disciplined acquisition, management and (re)insurance practices across a diverse portfolio of loss reserves;


• | via active underwriting segments, take on underwriting risks across a balanced range of select specialty lines where the expected margins compensate for the risk and/or the costs of risk mitigation;


• | seek investment risk where it is adequately rewarded;


• | maintain reserving risk at low to moderate levels; and


• | ensure capital, liquidity, credit, operational and regulatory risks remain low.

These strategies are pursued through the use of appropriate controls, governance structures and highly skilled teams effectively working together. 
We embed our risk strategy in our organization by promoting a culture of high risk awareness. This is achieved in the demonstration of our day-to-day approach in how we manage our business and in how we manage and assess challenges and opportunities. 
Risk Appetite
The primary objective of our risk appetite framework is to monitor and protect the Group from an unacceptable level of loss, compliance failures and adverse reputational impact. It considers material risks in the business relating to: strategy, capital adequacy, insurance, investment/market, reinsurance counterparty/credit, regulatory, tax and operational risk. Risk appetite and tolerance is set by our Board and reviewed annually. It represents the amount of risk that we are willing to accept as a Group compared to risk metrics based on our shareholders' equity, capital resources, potential financial loss, and other risk-specific measures.
Accountability for the implementation, monitoring and oversight of risk appetite is assigned to individual corporate executives and monitored and maintained by the Risk Management function. Risk tolerance levels are monitored and deviations from pre-established levels are reported in order to facilitate responsive action.
Our subsidiary companies’ risk appetite frameworks are aligned with the risk appetite framework of the Group, while local company appetite and tolerances are set by the local boards. A review is undertaken annually to confirm the subsidiary risk appetite does not in the aggregate exceed Group risk appetite.
Risk metrics levels are set and monitored regularly by an appointed owner and reported to management committees and to our Board and Risk Committee on at least a quarterly basis. Stress and scenario tests are key tools within our risk appetite framework, used as risk indicators across risk categories and to support a forward looking assessment of risk. As part of monitoring and aggregating risk exposures across the Group, capital impact assessments are performed for risks that are deemed material. 
Risk Governance and Risk Management Organization
Our ERM framework consists of numerous processes and controls that have been designed by management, with oversight by the Board of Directors and its committees, and implemented by employees across the organization. The purpose of our ERM framework is to appropriately assess and manage risk as we continue to take opportunities to meet our business objectives. Senior executives are ultimately accountable for key defined risks and are responsible for providing regular reporting to the Group Executive Team (our "executives"), Management Risk Committee ("MRC"), Board Risk Committee and Board; and to facilitate the same to subsidiary committees and boards to support decision making and strong risk governance. The collective boards, management and employees are responsible for the effective implementation and/or operation of processes and controls.
Board of Directors
Our Board and its committees (and subsidiary boards of directors) receive management information from our executives, Board committees and management committees relating to performance against strategy and regularly review information regarding, among other things, acquisitions, active underwriting, loss reserves, credit, liquidity and investments, operations and information security and the risks associated with each. 
Our Risk Committee has responsibility to assist the Board in overseeing the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’s ERM framework, including by reviewing and evaluating the risks to which the Company is exposed, as well as monitoring and overseeing the guidelines and policies that govern the processes by which the Company identifies, assesses and manages its exposure to risk. Our Audit Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, oversees our accounting and financial reporting-related risks and internal control environment, receiving regular reports via the annual internal and external audit process. Our Investment Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s investment portfolio and investment-related risk, determining the Group’s investment strategy and guidelines and approving investment transactions in accordance with these guidelines. Our Compensation Committee oversees compensation-related risks. On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee undertakes a risk assessment of our compensation programs to ensure they are properly aligned with Company performance and do not provide incentives for our employees to take inappropriate or excessive risks. Our Nominating and Governance Committee considers risk relating to management succession planning and other corporate governance matters.
Executive and Risk Management Organization
In addition to the director oversight provided by our Risk Committee, our ERM governance structure is supported by our Management Risk Committee ("MRC") comprising executives and members of senior management who are responsible for the management of key risks and representatives from assurance functions. At the operating subsidiary level, risks relating to our individual insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are also overseen by the subsidiary boards of directors, subsidiary risk committees and other committees, and management teams, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and our ERM framework. 
The MRC is chaired by the Chief Operating Officer and meets regularly. The MRC discusses, challenges and debates the risks in the business and those emerging and where required recommends changes to the course of activity in reacting to these risks. The MRC also provides oversight and governance of ERM matters for the Group, monitoring risk assumption and risk mitigation activities and their consistency with the Risk Appetite Framework while promoting and sponsoring risk culture and awareness throughout the Group. 
Risk Ownership, Accountability and Assurance
We have adopted the "three lines of defense" model. Our first line consists of our executives and members of senior management and their function as leaders and risk owners. They are responsible for executing the risk management strategy and appropriately managing the activities and conduct of the business functions, as well as promoting staff understanding of strategy, risk mitigating policies and procedures. 
Our second line comprises our various risk, control and compliance oversight functions. Our Risk Management function reports to our executives, the MRC and our Risk Committee and focuses primarily on implementing and overseeing the administration of the MRC and Risk Committee directives and facilitating an efficient, effective and consistent approach to risk management across the Group. Our management assurance is further complemented by our compliance function which seeks to mitigate legal and regulatory compliance risks and ensures that appropriate, effective and responsive compliance services are available to the business units across the Group. Other second line functions include certain activities of our actuarial function and other Group functions contributing to our management assurance. 
Our third line of defense comprises our internal audit function which independently reviews the effectiveness of our ERM framework. The results of audits are monitored by the Audit Committee. Independent assurance from external third parties (e.g., independent actuarial services, etc.) also sits within our third line of defense.
Entity Level Management
At the operating subsidiary level, risks relating to our individual insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are also overseen by the subsidiary boards of directors, subsidiary risk committees and other committees, and management teams, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and our ERM framework.
Certain risks relating to the Group’s underwriting segments (Atrium and StarStone) are distinct from the Non-life Run-off segment. These businesses include external stakeholders that also differ from our other businesses, including joint venture partners, rating agencies, and, with respect to Atrium, third party Lloyd’s names who provide approximately 75% of the underwriting capacity to Atrium’s Syndicate 609. Atrium and StarStone each maintain dedicated ERM frameworks to manage risk, return and capital in the individual businesses, which align with and form part of Group ERM. These include oversight at the Atrium and StarStone boards of directors, as well as executive risk committees and other committees that manage and monitor risks relevant to specified functional areas. Individualized risk policies and risk appetites are established and tailored to the specific needs of Atrium and StarStone, respectively. Enstar executives serve as members of the Atrium and StarStone boards of directors and certain committees.
The Group and each regulated insurance entity have a unique risk register documenting its risk landscape, with risk, key risk metric, and control owners assigned, which is maintained through a risk management software system. Specific functions, such as IT, maintain risk registers with more detailed and specific risks and controls. The risk and control assessment process is carried out on a quarterly basis using a risk management software system. 
Risk Categories
We manage our ERM process based on the major categories of risk within our business discussed below. Our ERM is a dynamic process, with updates continually being made as a result of changes in our business, industry and the economic environment. This process and our controls cannot provide absolute assurance that our risk management objectives will be met or that all risks will be appropriately identified and managed, and accordingly, the possibility of material adverse effects on our company remains. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for important information on the risks we face.
Strategic Risk.    Strategic risk is the risk of unintended adverse impact on the business plan objectives arising from business decisions, improper implementation of those decisions, inability to adapt to changes in the external environment, or circumstances that are beyond our control. We manage strategic risk by utilizing a strategic business planning process involving our executives and Board. Our annual business plan is reviewed and overseen by our executives and Board, and actual performance, trends, and uncertainties are monitored in comparison to the plan throughout the year. We specifically evaluate acquisition opportunities pursuant to a detailed and proprietary process that takes into account, among other things, the risk of the transaction and potential returns, the portfolio’s risk exposures, claims management practices, reserve requirements and outstanding claims, as well as risks specifically related to our ability to integrate the acquired business. Our governance process, led by our Board of Directors, reviews newly proposed transaction opportunities, capital-raising matters, and other significant business initiatives. In order to effectively participate in future opportunities and manage downside risks (due to external events) we review and monitor our liquidity and available financing. We rely on our processes to help us to anticipate potential adverse changes and, where possible, avoid or mitigate them.
Capital Adequacy Risk.    Capital adequacy risk is the risk that capital levels are or become insufficient to ensure our insurance obligations will be met and policyholders are protected. We have a low appetite for capital adequacy risk. As well as meeting our regulatory obligations, the ability to effectively participate in future opportunities is dependent upon the Group and its subsidiaries continually meeting (and/or exceeding) solvency requirements. We endeavor to manage our capital such that all of our regulated entities meet local regulatory capital requirements at all times and maintain adequate capital to enable our insurance obligations to be met while taking into account the risks faced. We aim to deploy capital efficiently and to establish adequate loss reserves that we believe will protect against future adverse developments. Capital adequacy and its ability on an ongoing basis to support the business under adverse circumstances is assessed via stress and scenario testing. Specific scenarios are mandated under the various regulatory regimes in which the Group and its subsidiaries operate. User-defined scenarios have also been developed and are regularly tested and reported on.
Insurance Risk.    Insurance risk spans many aspects of our insurance operations, including underwriting risk, risk assumed upon acquisitions/portfolio transfers and risk associated with our reserving assumptions. 
Underwriting risk in our active underwriting businesses relates to the inherent uncertainty as to the occurrence, amount and timing of insurance liabilities we assume through our underwriting process. We manage exposure levels across risk categories to maintain them within the approved risk appetite. Underwriting risk management strategies may differ depending on the line of business involved and the type of account being insured or reinsured. 
We strive to mitigate underwriting risk through our controls and strategies, including our underwriting risk selection, diversification of our underwriting portfolios by class and geography, purchasing reinsurance, establishing a business plan and associated parameters, underwriting peer review, authority limits, underwriting guidelines that provide detailed underwriting criteria and a framework for pricing, along with the use of specialized underwriting teams supported by actuarial, catastrophe modeling, claims, risk management, legal, finance, and other technical personnel. 
We utilize internally developed pricing models to evaluate individual underwriting decisions within the context of business plans and risk appetites. We also use internally developed capital models, which provide information on key risks and facilitate an understanding of the interaction among the risks and related exposures, as a comprehensive tool for business and capital planning. 
In some business lines we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single peril, such as a natural catastrophe event (for example, a hurricane, windstorm, tornado, flood or earthquake) or a man-made event (for example, war, terrorism, airplane crashes and other transportation-related accidents, or building fires). We model and manage our individual and aggregate exposures to these events and other material correlated exposures in accordance with our risk appetite. Our modeling process utilizes major commercial vendor models to measure certain of these exposures. The incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes and other event types are inherently unpredictable, and it is difficult to estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. Accordingly, there is material uncertainty around our ability to measure exposures, which can cause actual exposures and losses to deviate from our estimates. 
To monitor catastrophe risk, we review exceedance probability curves aggregated across Atrium and StarStone together with aggregated realistic disaster scenarios. We consider occurrence exceedance probability and aggregate exceedance probability, which reflect losses resulting from single or multiple events, from individual perils and in the aggregate. We manage our underwriting exposure through a combination of reporting zonal aggregations, realistic disaster scenarios and stochastic modeling. StarStone also manages its underwriting exposure through monitoring realistic disaster scenarios for man-made events and certain natural catastrophe risks, and applying absolute maximum limits by line of business. 
Acquisition Risk.    We manage acquisition risks through our acquisition evaluation process and our reserving practices discussed above in "Liability for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses." Acquisition pricing risk can arise from a potential loss in value following an acquisition due to an underestimation of liabilities, a failure to generate assumed future cash flows that supported the pricing analysis (due to an underperformance of investments and/or underestimation of expenses) or an unexpected increase in capital requirements necessary to support the transaction due to unanticipated regulatory changes. We rely on due diligence to strategically select risks, and assume only select portfolios when our due diligence supports our negotiated pricing. In aggregate, we have a high risk appetite to continue to execute transactions, with no express restrictions on the size, geography or lines of business that we will review and consider. However, we have a low aggregate risk appetite for transactions that could ultimately have a negative impact on book value per share. 
Reserving Risk. Reserving risk is the risk that a Company's reserves are not sufficient to cover its unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense costs. The estimation of reserves is subject to uncertainty because the ultimate cost of settling claims is dependent upon future events and loss development trends that can vary with the impact of economic, social, and legal and regulatory matters. We manage reserving risk through our reserving practices discussed above in "Liability for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Loss Reserving," as well as through our commutation and policy buy-back strategy and claims management practices. We also have a Reserving Committee that is responsible for managing reserving risk and making recommendations to our Chief Financial Officer on the appropriate level of reserves to include in our consolidated financial statements. For additional information relating to our loss reserves by segment, "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies."
Investment/Market Risk.    Investment / Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from under-performing investment returns, dilution of investment capital, or adverse financial market movements (such as interest rates or exchange rates). Investment / Market risk can be broken down into the following sub-risks which may threaten our ability to effectively manage the investment portfolio: interest rate risk, credit spread risk, public equity risk, alternative investment risk and concentration risk. We manage Investment / Market risk in a number of ways, including use of investment guidelines; regular reviews of investment opportunities; market conditions; portfolio duration; oversight of the selection and performance of external asset managers; regular stress testing of the portfolio against known and hypothetical scenarios; established tolerance levels; and we manage foreign currency by asset/liability matching and use of derivatives. Investments are primarily managed by our Investment function, which is overseen by our Investment Committee.
Liquidity Risk.    Liquidity risk is the risk that we are unable to realize investments and other assets in order to settle financial obligations when they fall due or that we would have to incur excessive cost to do so. We manage this risk generally by following an investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide sufficient liquidity for the prompt payment of claims and contract liabilities, as well as for settlement of commutation payments. Liquidity risk also includes the risk of our dependence of our future cash flows upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, which is limited by applicable laws and regulations. Due to our acquisitive strategy, liquidity risk at the Group level also includes immediate cash needs as a result of the purchase of (re)insurance portfolios and/or capital injections into a new or existing subsidiary to support associated solvency requirements as a direct result of merger and acquisition activity or other significant changes. We manage this risk through our capital management and planning processes, which include reviews of minimum capital resources requirements at our regulated subsidiaries and anticipated distributions, as well as anticipated capital needs. 
Credit / Counterparty Risk.     Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of a counterparty’s ability to make timely payments in accordance with contractual terms of the instrument or contract. We are exposed to direct credit risk primarily within our portfolios of fixed maturity and short-term investments, and through customers, brokers and reinsurers in the form of premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables.  In addition, we are exposed to credit risk through our funds withheld arrangements if the reinsured company is unable to honor the value of the funds held balances, such as in the event of insolvency. In our run-off businesses, we manage credit risk with respect to our reinsurance recoverables by ongoing monitoring of counterparty ratings and working to achieve prompt payment of reinsured claims, as well as through our commutation strategy. For funds withheld arrangements, we generally have the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by us to the reinsured for losses payable and other amounts contractually due. In our active underwriting businesses, we firstly mitigate credit risk through our reinsurance purchasing process, where reinsurers are subject to financial security and rating requirements prior to approval and by limiting exposure to individual reinsurers. Thereafter we manage credit risk by the regular monitoring of reinsurance recoveries and premium due directly or via brokers and other intermediaries. In our fixed maturity and short-term investment portfolios, we attempt to mitigate credit risk through diversification and issuer exposure limitation. 
Operational Risk.    Operational risk is the risk of a loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from external events, personnel, systems or third parties. Due to our acquisitive strategy, operational risk also includes risks and challenges associated with integrating new companies into the Group. We seek to mitigate operational risks through the application of our policies and procedures and internal control and compliance processes throughout the Group and a focus on acquisition integration and assimilation of new companies into our internal control systems, including but not limited to operational incident management, business continuity planning, information security procedures, financial reporting controls and a review process for material third-party vendor usage. 
Regulatory Risk.  Regulatory risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions resulting in a financial loss, or loss of reputation as a result of an insurer’s failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards, and codes of conduct. We manage regulatory risk through a focus on compliance with laws and regulations, adherence to our policies and procedures (including our Code of Conduct) and our internal controls, an established corporate governance framework and practices, and communication and engagement with external stakeholders.
Tax Risk.  Tax risk is the risk that tax requirements are not adhered to accurately or in a timely manner resulting in a financial loss. We proactively seek to identify, evaluate, manage, monitor and mitigate tax risks. We are committed to complying with all tax laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Group. In evaluating potential transactions we consider the overall commercial, financial and tax aspects. Where there is uncertainty or complexity in relation to a tax risk, we may seek external advice and, where appropriate, we may obtain tax clearances from relevant tax authorities. 
Regulation 
General 
The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another. Our material operations are in Bermuda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and several Continental European countries. We are subject to extensive regulation under the applicable statutes in these countries and any others in which we operate. In addition, the Bermuda Monetary Authority ("BMA") acts as group supervisor of our insurance and reinsurance companies (our "Group"). A summary of the material regulations governing us in these countries is set forth below. 
We may become subject in the future to regulation in new jurisdictions or additional regulations in existing jurisdictions depending on the location and nature of any companies acquired and the volume and location of business being transacted by our existing companies. 
Bermuda 
Group Supervision
The BMA’s group supervision objective is to provide a coordinated approach to the regulation of an insurance group and its supervisory and capital requirements. Bermuda has been recognized by the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") as a qualified jurisdiction, and the E.U. recognizes Bermuda's full equivalence under Solvency II effective from January 1, 2016. 
We are group supervised by the BMA. As our Group supervisor, the BMA performs a number of functions including: (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of information for other regulatory authorities; (ii) carrying out a supervisory review and assessment of our Group; (iii) carrying out an assessment of our Group's compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (iv) planning and coordinating, through regular meetings with other authorities, supervisory activities in respect of our Group; (v) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against our Group or any Group members; and (vi) coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors in order to facilitate the carrying out of these functions. StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited ("SIBL") has been named as our Group’s Designated Insurer. As Designated Insurer, SIBL is required to facilitate compliance by our Group with the insurance solvency and supervision rules. 
On an annual basis, the Group is required to file Group statutory financial statements, a Group statutory financial return, a Group capital and solvency return, audited Group financial statements, a Group Solvency Self-Assessment ("GSSA"), and a financial condition report with the BMA. The GSSA is designed to document our perspective on the capital resources necessary to achieve our business strategies and remain solvent, and to provide the BMA with insights on our risk management, governance procedures and documentation related to this process. In addition, the Group is required to file a quarterly financial return with the BMA. 
We are required to maintain available Group statutory capital and surplus in an amount that is at least equal to the group enhanced capital requirement ("Group ECR"). The BMA has also established a group target capital level equal to 120% of the Group ECR.
The BMA also maintains supervision over the controllers of all Bermuda registered insurers, and accordingly, any person who, directly or indirectly, becomes a holder of at least 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of our ordinary shares must notify the BMA in writing within 45 days of becoming such a holder (or ceasing to be such a holder). The BMA may object to such a person and require the holder to reduce its holding of ordinary shares and direct, among other things, that voting rights attaching to the ordinary shares shall not be exercisable. 
Operating Subsidiaries
The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (together, the "Insurance Act"), regulate the insurance and reinsurance business of our operating subsidiaries in Bermuda. The Insurance Act imposes certain solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. 
Significant requirements pertaining to our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries vary depending on the class in which our company is registered, but generally include the appointment of a principal representative in Bermuda, the appointment of an independent auditor, the appointment of an approved loss reserve specialist, the filing of annual statutory and GAAP financial statements, the filing of statutory financial returns, compliance with group solvency and supervision rules, and compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct (relating to corporate governance, risk management and internal controls). 
Our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries must also comply with a minimum liquidity ratio and minimum solvency margin. The minimum liquidity ratio requires that the value of relevant assets must not be less than 75% of the amount of relevant liabilities. The minimum solvency margin, which varies depending on the class of the insurer, is determined as a percentage of either net reserves for losses and LAE or premiums or pursuant to a risk-based capital measure. KaylaRe Ltd. and StarStone Insurance Bermuda Limited, both Class 4 insurers, Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited, a Class 3B insurer and Fitzwilliam Insurance Limited, a Class 3A insurer, all domiciled in Bermuda, are subject to an enhanced capital requirement ("ECR") determined pursuant to a risk-based capital measure and are required to file a Commercial Insurer’s Solvency Self-Assessment (“CISSA”), and a financial condition report with the BMA.
Each of our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if it were in breach of its minimum solvency margin or liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause it to fail to meet such margin or ratio. In addition, each of our regulated Bermuda subsidiaries is prohibited, without the prior approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital, or from reducing by 25% of more its total statutory capital and surplus, as set out in its previous year’s statutory financial statements. Our Bermuda insurance companies that are in run-off are required to seek BMA approval for any dividends or distributions.
Economic Substance Act
The Economic Substance Act 2018 (the “ESA”) was passed in Bermuda in December 2018 in response to the decision of the European Union Code of Conduct Group (Business taxation) (the "EU Code Group") to place Bermuda, as well as other offshore jurisdictions, on notice of being included in a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. Under the provisions of the ESA, any Bermuda-registered entity engaged in a “relevant activity” (which includes insurance business and holding entity activities) must maintain a substantial economic presence in Bermuda. To the extent that the ESA applies to our entities registered in Bermuda, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with economic substance requirements by filing an annual economic substance declaration with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.
United Kingdom and Lloyd’s 
United Kingdom 
Our U.K.-based insurance subsidiaries consist of wholly-owned run-off companies. These subsidiaries are authorized by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the "PRA"), and are also regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA", together with the PRA, the "U.K. Regulator"). Our U.K. run-off subsidiaries may not underwrite new business without the approval of the U.K. Regulator. E.U. directives also allow certain of our regulated U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in E.U. states other than the U.K. within the scope of permission granted by the U.K. Regulator without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in E.U. countries. 
Our U.K.-based insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain adequate financial resources in accordance with the requirements of the U.K. Regulator. The calculation of the minimum capital resources requirements in any particular case depends on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance business written and claims paid by the insurance company.
The Solvency II framework directive, which took effect on January 1, 2016, sets out new E.U.-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the aim of further increasing policyholder protection, instilling greater risk awareness and improving the international competitiveness of E.U. insurers. Insurers must comply with a Solvency Capital Requirement ("SCR"), which is calculated using either the Solvency II standard formula or a bespoke internal model. Our non-Lloyd's U.K. companies use the standard formula.
The U.K. Regulator’s rules require our U.K. insurance subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval for any proposed or actual payment of a dividend. The U.K. Regulator uses the SCR, among other tests, when assessing requests to make distributions. 
In an advisory referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to leave the E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). For a discussion of the potential impact of Brexit on our operations, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Laws and Regulation."
Under the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 ("FSMA"), any company or individual (together with its or his concert parties) proposing to directly or indirectly acquire "control" over a U.K. authorized insurance company (which is generally defined as acquiring 10% or more of the shares or voting power in a U.K. authorized insurance company or its parent company) must seek prior approval of the U.K. Regulator of his intention to do so. A person who is already deemed to have "control" will require prior regulatory approval if the person increases the level of "control" beyond 20%, 30% and 50%. 
Lloyd’s
We participate in the Lloyd’s market through our interests in: (i) Atrium’s Syndicate 609, which is managed by Atrium Underwriters Limited, a Lloyd's managing agent; (ii) StarStone’s Syndicate 1301, which is managed by StarStone Underwriting Limited ("SUL"), a Lloyd’s managing agent; and (iii) Syndicate 2008, a wholly aligned syndicate that has permission to underwrite RITC business and other run-off or discontinued business type transactions with other Lloyd’s syndicates. SUL serves as managing agent for Syndicate 2008. All of the Group’s underwriting by these syndicates is supported by one or more internal corporate members.
Our Lloyd’s operations are subject to authorization and regulation by the U.K. Regulator and compliance with the Lloyd’s Act(s) and Byelaws and regulations, as well as the applicable provisions of the FSMA. The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting, and its exercise of these powers might affect the return on an investment of the corporate member in a given underwriting year. This discretion includes the ability to assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution. 
The underwriting capacity of a corporate member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as "Funds at Lloyd’s") in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in satisfaction of its capital requirement. The amount of the Funds at Lloyd’s is assessed annually and is determined by Lloyd’s in accordance with applicable capital adequacy rules. 
Business plans, including maximum underwriting capacity, for Lloyd’s syndicates requires annual approval by the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which may require changes to any business plan or additional capital to support underwriting plans. 
In order to achieve finality and to release their capital, Lloyd’s members are usually required to have transferred their liabilities through an approved RITC, such as offered by Syndicate 2008. RITC is generally put in place after the third year of a syndicate year of account. On successful conclusion of RITC, any profit from the syndicate for that year of account can be fully remitted by the managing agent to the syndicate’s members. 
The Lloyd’s market has applied the Solvency II internal model under Lloyd’s supervision, and our Lloyd’s operations are required to meet Solvency II standards. The Society of Lloyd's has received approval from the PRA to use its internal model under the Solvency II regime.
Lloyd’s approval is required before any person can acquire control of a Lloyd’s managing agent or Lloyd’s corporate member. 
United States 
Our insurance and reinsurance companies domiciled in the United States consist of property and casualty companies in run-off, as well as StarStone Specialty Insurance Company (a U.S. excess and surplus lines insurer) and StarStone National Insurance Company (a U.S. admitted insurer that is licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia). Our U.S. insurers are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision by the states in which they are domiciled, licensed and/or eligible to conduct business. The insurance laws and regulations of the state of domicile have the most significant impact on operations. We currently have U.S. insurers and reinsurers domiciled in Texas, New York, Delaware, Missouri, Oklahoma and Rhode Island, with one of these insurers also commercially domiciled in California.
Generally, regulatory authorities have broad regulatory powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates and policy forms (except for excess and surplus lines insurers), marketing practices, claims practices, investments, security deposits, restrictions on size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, corporate governance, enterprise risk management, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and LAE, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations, annual and other report filings, and transactions among affiliates. 
As to periodic examinations, regulators have begun to look well beyond financial solvency and market conduct. In 2017, for example, the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) increased its focus on cybersecurity, requiring financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS to establish a cybersecurity program. The NYDFS now also requires the completion of an extensive questionnaire regarding each New York domestic insurer’s cybersecurity program in connection with such examinations. Additionally, most states require the completion of an extensive questionnaire, similar to that required by New York, in connection with such examinations. Other states are expected to enact similar laws based on the NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law, adopted in 2017.
U.S. insurers are also required to maintain minimum levels of solvency and liquidity as determined by law, and to comply with risk-based capital requirements and licensing rules. Insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the risk-based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action. If any of our U.S. insurers were to have risk-based capital levels that are below required levels, they would be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and control by their domestic and possibly other insurance regulators. As of December 31, 2018, all of our U.S. insurers exceeded their required levels of risk-based capital. 
Applicable insurance laws also limit the amount of dividends or other distributions our U.S. insurers can pay to us. The insurance regulatory limitations are generally based on statutory net income and/or certain levels of statutory surplus as determined by the insurer’s state or states of domicile. Generally, prior regulatory approval must be obtained before an insurer may pay a dividend or make a distribution above a specified level. 
All states have enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company systems that requires each insurance company in the system to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. The NAIC has adopted amendments to the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and associated regulations, which all states in which our U.S. insurers are domiciled or commercially domiciled have adopted. The amendments provide the regulators with additional tools to evaluate risks to an insurance company within the insurance holding company system. They impose more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers with the purpose of protecting them from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person of the insurers identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the insurers and requiring a person divesting its controlling interest to make a confidential advance notice filing. 
The NAIC has also adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act, which requires insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for insurers or their insurance group to conduct an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ("ORSA") in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act has been adopted in all of the states in which our U.S. insurers are domiciled, and our insurers in these states may be subject to ORSA requirements if certain premium thresholds are exceeded. Where applicable, we must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with the ORSA Model Act, including undertaking an internal risk management review no less often than annually and preparing a summary report assessing the adequacy of risk management and capital in light of our insurers’ current and future business plans.
In addition, the NAIC’s Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure (“CGAD”) Model Act and Regulation requires the annual filing of a disclosure describing the insurance group’s corporate governance structure, policies, and practices. The Model Act and Regulation have been adopted in some, though not all, of the states in which we have insurers domiciled. There are no premium thresholds for CGAD.
The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and, among other things, established the Financial Services Oversight Council and created within the United States Department of the Treasury a Federal Insurance Office ("FIO"). The FIO is authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the U.S. insurance industry and the significance of global reinsurance to the U.S. insurance market. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the federal preemption of certain state insurance laws and streamlines the regulation of reinsurance and surplus lines/non-admitted insurance. 
Before a person can acquire control of a domestic insurer (including a reinsurer) or any person controlling such insurer (including acquiring control of Enstar Group Limited), prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state in which the domestic insurer is domiciled and, under certain circumstances, from insurance commissioners in other jurisdictions. Generally, state statutes and regulations provide that "control" over a domestic insurer or person controlling a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting securities or securities convertible into voting securities of the domestic insurer or of a person who controls the domestic insurer. 
Australia 
Our Australian regulated insurance entities (which include our insurance subsidiary and our non-operating holding company) are subject to prudential supervision by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA"). APRA is the primary regulatory body responsible for regulating compliance with the Insurance Act 1973. APRA has issued prudential standards that apply to general insurers in relation to capital adequacy, the holding of assets in Australia, risk management, business continuity management, reinsurance management, outsourcing, audit and actuarial reporting and valuation, the transfer and amalgamation of insurance businesses, governance, and the fit and proper assessment of the insurer’s responsible persons. 
APRA’s prudential standards require that all insurers maintain and meet prescribed capital adequacy requirements to enable their insurance obligations to be met under a wide range of circumstances. 
APRA also prescribes prudential standards on risk management and governance. These requirements include the need for regulated insurance entities to have a risk management framework that is consistent and integrated with its risk profile and capital strength, supported by a risk management function and subject to comprehensive review. APRA’s risk management requirements also include the need for regulated insurance entities to have a board risk committee that provides the Board with objective non-executive oversight of the implementation and on-going operation of its risk management framework, and the requirement that regulated insurance entities designate a chief risk officer who is involved in, and provides effective challenge to, activities and decisions that may materially affect the regulated insurance entities’ risk profile. Our Australian regulated insurance entities are compliant with these requirements. 
An insurer must obtain APRA’s written consent prior to making any capital releases, including any payment of dividends in excess of current year earnings. Our insurance subsidiary must provide APRA a valuation prepared by an appointed actuary that demonstrates that the tangible assets of the insurer, after the proposed capital reduction, are sufficient to cover its insurance liabilities to a 99.5% level of sufficiency of capital before APRA will consent to a capital release or dividend. 
Under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, the interest of an individual shareholder or a group of associated shareholders in an insurer is generally limited to a 15% "stake" of the insurer. A person’s stake is the aggregate of the person’s voting power and the voting power of the person’s associates. A higher percentage limit may be approved by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia on national interest grounds. Any shareholder of Enstar Group Limited with a "stake" greater than 15% has received approval to hold that stake from the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. 
Europe
In addition to Bermuda, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States, we have subsidiaries in Belgium, as well as StarStone Insurance SE, a Liechtenstein-based company that continues to underwrite new business through branches across Europe and is regulated by the Financial Markets Authority. StarStone Insurance Europe AG was merged into StarStone Insurance SE in Liechtenstein effective from October 1, 2017, following the relocation of StarStone Insurance SE’s principal office from the U.K. to Liechtenstein on May 8, 2017. With effect from January 1, 2019, our Swiss insurance subsidiary redomesticated to Bermuda and is now regulated by the BMA. It continues to have a UK branch.
Our subsidiaries and branches in European jurisdictions such as Belgium and Liechtenstein are regulated in their respective home countries. Typically, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders and ceding insurance companies rather than shareholders. Regulatory authorities generally have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, investments, reporting requirements relating to capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations, special reporting and prior approval requirements with respect to certain transactions among affiliates, reserves for unpaid losses and LAE, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations and annual and other report filings. The application of the Solvency II framework across such European jurisdictions from January 1, 2016 generally results in a more uniform approach to regulation. 
Other
We own a Non-life Run-off subsidiary in Hong Kong, and through StarStone participate in a joint venture there. These operations are not material, but our companies are subject to applicable regulations.
