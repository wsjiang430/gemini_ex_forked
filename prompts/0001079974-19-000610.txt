Effective August 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation ("Zoompass") that was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on June 8, 2016.   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,050,784 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass Inc.'s Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder of the Company agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company has amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and the appropriate forms were filed with FINRA and the SEC to change its name, address and symbol and complete a 3.5-1 forward split, which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on September 7, 2016 and approved in February 2017, for shareholders of record on September 7, 2016.
 
All share figures have been retroactively stated to reflect the stock split approved by shareholders, unless otherwise indicated.  Additionally, the Company's shareholders consented to an increase of the shares authorized to 500,000,000 and a revision of the par value to $0.0001.
 
As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, the transaction does not constitute a business combination and was deemed to be a recapitalization of the Company with Zoompass being the accounting acquirer, accordingly the accounting and disclosure information is that of Zoompass going forward.
