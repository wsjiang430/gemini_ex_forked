 Item 1. Business.
 Company Overview
 Terran Orbital Corporation, formerly known as Tailwind Two Acquisition Corp. (“Tailwind Two”), together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Terran Orbital”), is a leading manufacturer of satellite products primarily serving the United States (“U.S.”) aerospace and defense industry. We provide end-to-end satellite solutions by combining satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support to meet the needs of our military, civil, and commercial customers. We have a foreign subsidiary based in Torino, Italy.
Formation and Organization
 Tailwind Two, which was formed in November 2020, was a publicly listed special purpose acquisition company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and completed its initial public offering in March 2021. On March 25, 2022, Tailwind Two acquired Terran Orbital Operating Corporation, formerly known as Terran Orbital Corporation (“Legacy Terran Orbital”) (such acquisition, the “Tailwind Two Merger”). In connection with the Tailwind Two Merger, Tailwind Two filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies and filed a certificate of incorporation and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, resulting in Tailwind Two becoming a Delaware corporation and changing its name from Tailwind Two to Terran Orbital Corporation. The Tailwind Two Merger resulted in Legacy Terran Orbital becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Terran Orbital Corporation.
 As a result of the Tailwind Two Merger, all of Legacy Terran Orbital's issued and outstanding common stock was converted into shares of Terran Orbital Corporation's common stock using an exchange ratio of 27.585 shares of Terran Orbital Corporation's common stock per each share of Legacy Terran Orbital's common stock. In addition, Legacy Terran Orbital's convertible preferred stock and certain warrants were exercised and converted into shares of Legacy Terran Orbital's common stock immediately prior to the Tailwind Two Merger, and in turn, were converted into shares of Terran Orbital Corporation's common stock upon the merger.
 While Legacy Terran Orbital became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Terran Orbital Corporation, Legacy Terran Orbital was deemed to be the acquirer in the Tailwind Two Merger for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the Tailwind Two Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, in which case our consolidated financial statements represent a continuation of Legacy Terran Orbital and the issuance of common stock in exchange for the net assets of Tailwind Two. Operations prior to the Tailwind Two Merger are those of Legacy Terran Orbital and all share and per-share data included in our consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to give effect to the Tailwind Two Merger. The treatment of the Tailwind Two Merger as a reverse recapitalization was based upon the pre-merger shareholders of Legacy Terran Orbital holding the majority of the voting interests of Terran Orbital Corporation, Legacy Terran Orbital's existing management team serving as the initial management team of Terran Orbital Corporation, Legacy Terran Orbital's appointment of the majority of the initial board of directors of Terran Orbital Corporation, and Legacy Terran Orbital's operations comprising the ongoing operations of the Company.
 Beginning on March 28, 2022, our common stock and public warrants began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbols “LLAP” and “LLAP WS,” respectively.
 Segment and Geographic Information
 We evaluate and report our segment information based on the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”), evaluates performance and allocates resources. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2022, we had two operating and reportable segments: Satellite Solutions and Earth Observation Solutions.
 The reportable segments were defined as follows:
 •Satellite Solutions
 The Satellite Solutions segment primarily consisted of the design, build and operation of satellites on behalf of our customers. The Satellite Solutions segment included our modern facilities and global ground station network to deliver

end-to-end satellite solutions, including spacecraft design, development, launch services, and on-orbit operations for critical missions across a number of applications in a variety of orbits to governmental agencies and commercial businesses.
 •Earth Observation Solutions
 The Earth Observation Solutions segment was created to develop, build, launch, and operate a constellation of company-owned Earth observation satellites featuring synthetic aperture radar (“SAR”) capabilities to provide Earth observation data and mission solutions. These capabilities were intended to provide the ability to observe and detect during day and night and through clouds and other interference. The Earth Observation Solutions segment was in its developmental stage, had not completed any of the intended company-owned satellites, and did not generate any material revenue.
 In October 2022, we re-assessed our liquidity and capital resources and determined to focus our production capacity on fulfilling existing and future customer contracts. We determined the most financially efficient method of providing advanced satellite imagery is to offer our Earth observation satellites as a product that customers can order as opposed to building a company-owned and operated constellation. Accordingly, the manner in which the CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources changed. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, we report our results as a single operating and reportable segment on a consolidated basis. Where applicable, prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current operating and reportable segment structure.
 Our operations are primarily performed in the U.S. Our international operations are primarily performed by our foreign subsidiary based in Torino, Italy.
 Products and Services
 We are an end-to-end satellite solutions provider with the following product and service offerings: 
 •Mission Support: We provide the integrated design, manufacture, and assembly of satellites suitable for the specific needs of our customers’ missions. Our satellite solutions are designed by our staff of engineers located in Irvine, California, Melbourne, Florida and Torino, Italy and manufactured and assembled primarily in our facilities located in Irvine, California, Santa Maria, California, and Torino, Italy.
 •Launch Support Services: We assist customers with the launch of satellites into space by identifying and securing launch opportunities with launch providers as well as coordinating and managing the activities leading up to the launch event on behalf of our customers.
 •Operations Services: We manage, operate, and provide information from satellites that are on-orbit on behalf of our customers from our in-house mission operations centers located in Irvine, California and Torino, Italy and via our fully integrated international ground communications network using our proprietary software both on the satellite and throughout our ground infrastructure.
 •Studies, Design and Other Services: We perform professional engineering feasibility studies and preliminary design services on behalf of our customers.
 Industry and Competitive Advantage Overview
 The space industry is undergoing a transformation toward proliferation of small satellites, supported by several macro-themes:
 •Movement from a small number of very large, expensive satellites with deep capabilities but limited Earth coverage at any given time, to large constellations of smaller satellites with high revisit rates.​
 •Movement from bespoke and costly satellite manufacturing techniques to high volume, high velocity industrialized production.​
 •Commoditization of launch costs enabling proliferation of smaller satellites and frequent refreshes to technology on orbit.​
 •New sensor technologies advanced by commercial markets, such as a new array of sensor payloads that are highly capable, robust, affordable to launch on orbit, and have high utilization and throughput. For example, modern SAR technology, 


which has the ability to see at night and day, in all weather conditions, and through obstructions such as foliage or smoke, has been miniaturized and became more cost-effective.​
 •Expansion and scaling of an industrial supply base to deliver proliferated satellite solutions to end customers with mission assurance, architecture and risk tolerances more suitable for proliferated systems, all within shorter time frames and substantially lower unit costs than historical systems.
 •Improved unit economics and speed, with smaller satellites enabling end buyers the flexibility to scale programs and innovate to solve for both urgent and long-term mission needs.
 •Expansion from predominantly owned-and-operated models under which very large customers build, fund, and operate their own satellites and mission capabilities, to an increased reliance on dedicated commercial providers to build, fund and/or operate whole satellite constellations at scale. In turn, this supports a data-as-a-service market where independent commercial companies undertake the effort of building, funding and/or operating constellations and make Earth observation imagery and other mission solutions more available to the end user.​
 •Large government organizations increasingly comfortable purchasing imagery as a service from more nimble, independent operators, and actively migrating budgets from retiring older space and airborne programs in addition to dedicating new capital sources. These increased budgets are largely only available to be used by purchasing from companies with deep integration to government programs, and highly secure supply chains and technology.
 We believe we are well positioned to capitalize off of these macro-themes as a leading satellite solutions provider with a record of delivering successful mission outcomes and real time intelligence for defense, intelligence, and commercial customers. We believe our ability to compete successfully does and will depend on several factors, including our ability to maintain flight heritage ahead of our peers, our lead in advanced technology, vertical integration and control over our products and customer confidence in the reliability of our solutions.
 We operate in a highly competitive industry and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have. Our competitors include: Blue Canyon Technologies (a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies Corporation), Millennium Space Systems (a subsidiary of The Boeing Company), General Atomics Defense (a subsidiary of General Atomics), Northrop Grumman Corporation, Airbus, Maxar Technologies, Inc., Ball Aerospace, Rocket Lab USA, Inc., and York Space Systems. We may also face competition in the future from emerging competitors or existing companies expanding their product and service offerings and becoming direct competitors, including companies such as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (“SpaceX”).
 We believe we have the following competitive advantages over our competitors:
 •Proven track record of successful space missions: A proven track record of success is a key space-specific barrier to entry. We have numerous flight-proven modules and devices demonstrated by a rich history of flight heritage. We believe our flight heritage allows us to avoid the pitfalls that many startups are currently encountering or will likely encounter in their initial endeavors.
 •Leadership team: Our leadership team has worked across the aerospace and defense industry, ranging from military and defense, intelligence, civil, national laboratory and commercial players. We have firsthand knowledge of government programs and budgets. This government expertise provides unique insight for us, driving business development and understanding of our customers’ goals and missions.
 •Industry-leading team of engineers: Our technology team has developed exceptional technology, which underpins our position at the forefront of the modern satellite industry. The engineering team is led by professionals who have held senior level positions across a diverse set of governmental and commercial entities. This team has created a wide set of systems at the intersection of quality and advanced technology, while preserving the ability to upgrade those systems even after launch. In addition to demonstrating success, our flight heritage has led to outsized opportunities and breadth of experience for our team, making for an experienced and highly capable base of engineers.
 •Focus on modular vehicles: We have long taken the approach of making our vehicles modular in nature. We generally use the same in-house manufactured parts and subsystems for all of our satellites, supplementing these core systems with additional internal and externally sourced components to meet mission needs. This allows us to provide customers with a competitively priced satellite solution, while maintaining a large degree of customization. This further means that when we develop a new satellite bus, nearly all, if not all, of the parts are space-proven and have operated in space. We believe this provides a significant competitive advantage over our peers when proving our ability to ensure mission success. We believe 


our substantial catalog of parts and subsystems, developed over a period of years, provides a significant barrier to entry and competitive advantage.
 •Strategic cooperation agreement with Lockheed Martin Corporation: On October 31, 2022, we entered into a new Strategic Cooperation Agreement (the “2022 SCA”) with Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin”), pursuant to which the parties have agreed to continue to share in business development opportunities and work collaboratively on small satellite and other aerospace and defense opportunities and ventures. In connection with the 2022 SCA, the parties agreed to (i) collaborate on the development, production, and sale of satellites for use in U.S. Government spacecraft and spacecraft procurement and (ii) establish a cooperation framework to enable the parties to enter into projects, research and development agreements, and other collaborative business arrangements and “teaming activities.” Unless earlier terminated, the 2022 SCA has a term of 13 years and will terminate in 2035. During the term of the 2022 SCA, Lockheed Martin will be entitled to appoint a director to our board of directors and to appoint a separate board observer.
 •Partnership with and compatibility across launch providers: We have relationships with several launch providers, including SpaceX, built through years of experience in securing launch vehicle opportunities and launching satellites for our customers around the world. Our satellite deployers can be tailored to meet customers’ specific launch program needs and to fit on most launch vehicles. This gives our customers flexibility around timing and availability of launches, which drives efficiencies.
 Growth Strategy
 Our financial success is based on our ability to deliver high quality products and services on a timely basis and at a cost-effective price for our customers. With the majority of our contracts with customers reflecting firm fixed pricing structures, our gross profit is dependent on the efficient and effective execution of our contracts. We are actively executing on our growth initiatives in order to position ourselves to be awarded larger constellation contracts with recurring revenue opportunities.
Our growth initiatives include, but are not limited to, the following:
 •Securing bigger contracts that involve large constellations of satellites;
 •Increasing labor capacity and efficiency, including adding engineering and assembly technician headcount;
 •Expansion and industrialization of manufacturing and assembly facilities in Irvine, California (previously planned to be in Florida's Space Coast) and adding testing and automation equipment to improve manufacturing efficiency, quality and throughput; and
 •Focus on and investment in the innovation and development of existing and new satellite components and subsystems, payloads, and flight and ground software applications, including development of next-generation components to improve performance, manufacturability and costs.
 As part of our evolving business strategy, we may expand our offerings from time to time. For example, we may diversify our offerings by pursuing the sale of components and subsystems to other spacecraft manufacturers and integrators.
 Customers and Concentrations
 Our direct and end customers include (i) U.S. Government defense, intelligence, and civil agencies such as the U.S. Department of Defense (the "DoD"), the Space Development Agency (the "SDA"), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ("NASA"); (ii) commercial aerospace and defense prime contractors, such as Lockheed Martin; (iii) foreign government and civil agencies, such as the European Space Agency ("ESA"); and (iv) other and foreign commercial companies that operate in the space industry.
A small number of customers and contracts historically have represented a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. Lockheed Martin represented approximately 76% and 50% of our consolidated revenue during 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 81% of our backlog was related to programs with Lockheed Martin.
 In addition, the majority of our contracts are related to U.S. Government programs in which we operate as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. U.S. Government programs represented approximately 73% and 54% of our consolidated revenue during 2022 and 2021,

respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 83% of our backlog was related to U.S. Government programs, all of which the U.S. Government has the ability to terminate for convenience.
 Resources Material to our Business
 Intellectual Property
 We believe that our unpatented research, development and engineering skills and other trade secrets are important to our business operations. We also own a portfolio of U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and applications. While these intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, trademark, copyright, license, or other intellectual property right, standing alone, is of such importance that its loss, expiration, or termination would have a material effect on our business as a whole.
The U.S. Government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of U.S. Government contracts and receives certain rights in our data when used or produced in the performance of U.S. Government contracts. The U.S. Government may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents or data provided pursuant to contracts for certain purposes. Further, as many of our products are complex and involve patented and other proprietary technologies, we face a risk of claims alleging that we have infringed upon third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, the invalidation of our intellectual property rights and/or increased licensing costs.
Supply Chain and Materials
 We are highly vertically integrated in that we design and manufacture many modular and flight-proven components and subsystems used in our assembly, integration, and testing of satellite and satellite buses. Our portfolio of common modular components includes bus panels, flight computers and software, star trackers, radios and antennas, battery modules and power systems, torque rods, and reactional wheels. For components and subsystems that we do not design and manufacture, we have an existing base of reputable and reliable third-party suppliers and subcontractors.
We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering engineering validation, quality, cost, delivery, and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied components meet quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and other inputs and services from multiple sources, in some cases we also purchase various inputs and services from a sole source. In those sole source supplier situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this sole source risk through carrying increased buffer stock, particularly on long-lead items.
 The coronavirus pandemic (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”) has contributed to a worldwide shortage of certain electronic components which has resulted in longer than historically experienced lead times for such electronic components. The reduced availability of electronic components used in our operations has negatively affected our timing and ability to deliver products and services to customers as well as increased the cost of such components in recent periods. In an effort to manage this disruption to our supply chain, we have focused on accumulating critical components to ensure an appropriate level of supply is available when needed.
 Research and Development
 Our current and future business is dependent on the development of new technology and applications as well as the maintenance and enhancement of existing offerings. We enhance our solutions via the performance of our customer contracts as well as self-funded research and development initiatives. In an effort to expand our end-to-end space-based solutions, we have, and plan to continue to, invest in the development of new satellite components and subsystems, payloads, and flight and ground software applications. Our efforts will continue to be directed into fields that we believe offer the greatest opportunities for long-term growth and profitability.
Government Regulation and Other Regulatory Matters
 In addition to federal securities laws and regulations and applicable stock exchange requirements, our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations can positively and negatively affect our operations and

impact the manner in which we conduct our business. Additional information on the risks related to the regulation of our business and operations discussed below can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).
 U.S. Government Contracts
 A substantial portion of our revenue is earned as a subcontractor to third parties ultimately serving the U.S. Government. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs, and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source, and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. Government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. Government; department-specific regulations that supplement the FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, audit and product integrity requirements.
 Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to audits. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency, the Inspectors General of the DoD and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Committees. From time to time, agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits may be initiated due to a number of reasons, including routine periodic audits or as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble or other damages, forfeitures, restitution, or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracting. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other improper conduct.
 Commercial Aerospace Product Regulation
 Our business is subject to extensive rules, regulations, statutes, orders, and policies imposed by the government in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") is responsible for authorizing the operation of commercial spacecraft, and also authorizes non-U.S. licensed spacecraft to be used to serve the U.S. The FCC also licenses the operation of satellite earth stations and regulates the technical and other aspects of the operation of these facilities. Earth station licenses generally are granted for 15 year terms, and typically are renewed in the ordinary course. Major changes in earth station operations would require prior approval by the FCC. The operation of our U.S. earth stations is subject to various license conditions, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC’s rules and regulations. The Department of Commerce, through the NOAA Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs ("CRSRA") office, regulates and licenses the operation of private Earth remote sensing space systems.
 In addition, satellites are to be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, which requires the coordination of the operation of satellite systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are intended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of the radio spectrum. The ITU Radio Regulations specifies the procedures associated with the shared international use of limited spectrum and orbital resources in a manner that avoids harmful interference. Among other things, the ITU regulations set forth procedures for establishing international priority with respect to the use of such resources, deadlines for bringing satellite networks into use in order to maintain such priority, and coordination rights and obligations with respect to other networks, which vary depending on whether such networks have higher or lower ITU priority.
 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and Export Controls
 Our business is subject to stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the ITAR, administered by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Political Military Affairs’ directorate of Defense Trade controls (“DDTC”), and Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”). The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that have commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. These regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S.
 The U.S. Government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations

to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. Government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime concerning the spaceflight business.
 Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain registration under the ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software, and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. Government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance by foreign persons, related to and who support our spaceflight business. Under the ITAR, we must receive permission from DDTC to release controlled technology to foreign person employees and other foreign persons.
 The inability to secure and maintain necessary licenses and other authorizations could negatively affect our ability to compete successfully. Failure to comply with export control laws and regulations could expose us to civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, more onerous compliance requirements, loss of export privileges, debarment from government contracts, or limitations on our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government. In addition, any changes in export control regulations or U.S. Government licensing policy, such as that necessary to implement U.S. Government commitments to multilateral control regimes, may restrict our operations. For further discussion of risks relating to ITAR and export controls, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Taxation Matters — We are subject to stringent U.S. export and import control laws and regulations. Unfavorable changes in these laws and regulations or U.S. Government licensing policies, our failure to secure timely U.S. Government authorizations under these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local, and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing pollution, the handling, storage, disposal and transportation of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contamination should it arise. The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations or a determination that we are responsible for a release of hazardous substances at our sites could result in significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions, and third-party claims. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment or natural resources.
At this time, we do not believe that federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business.
Foreign Regulations
 We conduct our business through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our business and operations are subject to additional U.S. and non-U.S. laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to foreign investment in the U.S, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed over 480 full-time employees, all of whom are based in the United States and Italy. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreement. We generally consider our relations with our employees to be positive.
 Our success largely depends on hiring and retaining top talent across the entire organization, with primary emphasis on key engineering capabilities. We compete for talent within specialized industries in California, Florida, and Italy. In order to attract and retain top talent, we focus on having a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment, while offering competitive compensation, health benefits, and retirement planning. Most employees are shareholders of the Company and have an equity ownership stake that is intended to align employee retention and value creation.
We have shared values, priorities, and principles across the organization that shape beliefs and drive behaviors and decision making to achieve high levels of performance at an individual, team, and organizational level. We are committed to fostering a culture and environment where every team member feels valued and empowered to collaborate and achieve business results. We provide employees with a structured performance management process and continuous feedback in order to further employee development.
We are committed to the highest standards of ethics and compliance and making sure every team member understands and embraces our core values of ethics, integrity, and respect for others. Our code of business ethics and conduct provides a framework of what is expected of our employees and fosters a culture of high integrity and compliance. Our code of business ethics and conduct is

supplemented by a variety of additional policies applicable to all team members which are designed to further foster ethical and sound business practices.
 We value and prioritize the health and safety of our team members and continually work to foster a culture of safety and compliance. Our vision is to build a culture that promotes safe behaviors on each task, every day, to achieve zero incidents and enhance employee wellness, and to minimize our environmental impact. In order to achieve our vision, we strive to incorporate our values of people, prevention, and accountability into our business and the decisions we make each day. In addition, we follow The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines with regard to quarantining, masking, and social distancing. We believe that all occupational injuries and illnesses, as well as environmental incidents, are generally preventable, and we focus on compliance with all applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements.
