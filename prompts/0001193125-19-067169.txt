ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
 Description of Business and Industry 
 Our principal business is the design and manufacture of aluminum wheels for sale to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in North America and Europe and aftermarket distributors in Europe. We employ approximately 8,000 employees, operating in nine manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe with a combined annual manufacturing capacity of approximately 21 million wheels. We believe we are the #1 North American aluminum wheel manufacturer, the #3 European aluminum wheel manufacturer and the #1 European aluminum wheel aftermarket manufacturer and supplier. Our OEM aluminum wheels accounted for approximately 92% of our sales in 2018 and are primarily sold for factory installation on many vehicle models manufactured by BMW-Mini, Daimler AG Company (Mercedes-Benz, AMG, Smart), FCA, Ford, GM, Honda, Jaguar-Land Rover, Mazda, Nissan, Renault, Peugeot, PSA, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, VW Group (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Porsche, Bentley) and Volvo. We also sell aluminum wheels to the European aftermarket under the brands ATS, RIAL, ALUTEC and ANZIO. North America and Europe represent the principal markets for our products, but we have a global presence and diversified customer base consisting of North American, European and Asian OEMs. We continue to deliver on our strategic plan to be one of the leading light vehicle aluminum wheel suppliers globally, delivering innovative wheel solutions to our customers. 
 As a result of the acquisition of our European operations on May 30, 2017, we have broadened our product portfolio and acquired a significant customer share with European OEMs including BMW-Mini, Daimler AG Company, Jaguar-Land Rover, VW Group and Volvo. The acquisition was not only complementary in terms of customers, market coverage and product offering but also very much aligned with our strategic direction with a priority focus on larger diameter wheels and premium finishes providing enhanced opportunity for higher value-added content. Our global reach encompasses sales to the ten largest OEMs in the world. The following chart shows our sales by customer for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 

Demand for our products is mainly driven by light-vehicle production levels in North America and Europe. North American light-vehicle production in 2018 was 17.0 million vehicles, a 0.6 percent decrease compared to 2017. In Western and Central Europe, light vehicle production level was 18.5 million vehicles, a 2.1 percent decrease over 2017. The majority of our customers wheel programs are awarded one, two or three years in advance. Our purchase orders with OEMs are typically specific to a particular vehicle model. 
 Customer Dependence 
 We have proven our ability to be a consistent producer of high quality aluminum wheels with the capability to meet our customers price, quality, delivery and service requirements. We continually strive to enhance our

  relationships with our customers through continuous improvement programs, not only through our manufacturing operations but in the engineering, design, development and quality areas as well. 
 Ford, GM and VW Group were our only customers individually accounting for 10 percent or more of our consolidated trade sales in 2018, with Toyota accounting for more than 10 percent in 2016 only. Net sales to these customers in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions): 
 

 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | | 2016 
 | Percent ofNet Sales | | | Dollars | | | Percent ofNet Sales | Dollars | | Percent ofNet Sales | | Dollars
Ford | | 18 | % | | $ | 272.6 | | 22 | % | $ | 248.8 | | 38 | % | $ | 271.4
GM | | 18 | % | | $ | 265.3 | | 20 | % | $ | 217.5 | | 30 | % | $ | 216.4
VW Group | | 12 | % | | $ | 183.9 | | 9 | % | $ | 94.3 | | <1 | % | $ | 2.8 
Toyota | | 8 | % | | $ | 114.0 | | 9 | % | $ | 103.8 | | 14 | % | $ | 98.4 

 In addition, sales to Daimler AG Company and Nissan exceeded five percent of our consolidated sales during 2018 and 2017. BMW-Mini and Volvo exceeded five percent of our consolidated sales in 2018 and Fiat Chrysler and Nissan were at or exceeded 5% of our sales in 2016. The change in sales over the three-year period was primarily driven by the acquisition of our European operations. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to Daimler AG Company, Ford, GM, Nissan, Toyota, Volvo, VW Group, and BMW-Mini would have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report. 
 Raw Materials 
 The raw materials used in manufacturing our products are readily available and are obtained through numerous suppliers with whom we have established trade relationships. Aluminum accounted for the vast majority of our total raw material requirements during 2018. Our aluminum requirements are met through purchase orders with major global producers. During 2018, we successfully secured aluminum commitments from our primary suppliers sufficient to meet our production requirements, and we anticipate being able to source aluminum requirements to meet our expected level of production in 2019. We procure other raw materials through numerous suppliers with whom we have established trade relationships. 
 When market conditions warrant, we may also enter into purchase commitments to secure the supply of certain other commodities used in the manufacture of our products, such as natural gas, electricity and other raw materials. 
 We establish price adjustment clauses with our OEM customers to minimize the aluminum price risk. In the aftermarket, we use hedging products to secure our aluminum purchase prices. 
 Foreign Operations 
 We manufacture a significant portion of our North American products in Mexico for sale in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Net sales of wheels manufactured in our Mexico operations in 2018 totaled $673.2 million and represented 84 percent of our total net sales in North America as compared to $608.0 million and 83 percent in 2017. Net property, plant and equipment used in our operations in Mexico totaled $221.5 million at December 31, 2018 and $214.5 million at December 31, 2017. The overall cost for us to manufacture wheels in Mexico is currently lower than in the United States, due to lower labor costs as a result of lower prevailing wage rates. 
 Similarly, we manufacture the majority of our products for the European market in Poland, for sale throughout Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales of wheels manufactured in Poland were $421.8 million and 60 percent of total net European sales versus $220.4 million and 59 percent in the seven months following the acquisition in 2017. Net property, plant and equipment used in our operations in Poland totaled $221.0 million at

  December 31, 2018 versus $227.3 million at December 31, 2017. Similar to our Mexican operations, the overall cost to manufacture wheels in Poland is substantially lower than in both the United States and Germany at the present time due principally to lower labor costs. 
 Net Sales Backlog 
 Our customers typically award programs one, two or three years before actual production is scheduled to begin. Each year, the automotive manufacturers introduce new models, update existing models and discontinue certain models. In this process, we may be selected as the supplier on a new model, we may continue as the supplier on an updated model or we may lose a new or updated model to a competitor. Our estimated net sales may be impacted by various assumptions, including new program vehicle production levels, customer price reductions, currency exchange rates and program launch timing. Our customers may terminate the awarded programs or reduce order levels at any time, based on market conditions or change in portfolio direction. Therefore, expected net sales information does not represent firm commitments or firm orders. We estimate that we have been awarded programs covering approximately 84 percent of our manufacturing capacity over the next three years. 
Competition 
 Competition in the market for aluminum wheels is based primarily on delivery, overall customer service, price, quality and technology. We currently supply approximately 19 percent and 13 percent of the aluminum wheels installed on passenger cars and light-duty trucks in North America and Europe, respectively. 
 Competition is global in nature with a significant volume of exports from Asia into North America. There are several competitors with facilities in North America but we estimate that we have more than twice the North American production capacity of any competitor. Some of the key competitors in North America include Central Motor Wheel of America (CMWA), CITIC Dicastal Co., Ltd., Prime Wheel Corporation, Enkei and Ronal. Key European competitors include Ronal, Borbet, Maxion and CMS. We are the leading manufacturer of alloy wheels in the European aftermarket, where the competition is highly fragmented. Key competitors include Alcar, Brock, Borbet, ATU and Mak. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report. 
 Steel and other types of wheels also compete with our products. Aluminum wheel usage on passenger cars, crossovers, SUVs and light-duty trucks continues to dominate in North America. According to Wards Automotive Group, the aluminum wheel penetration rate on passenger cars and light-duty trucks in North America was 88 percent for the 2018 model year compared to 87 percent for 2017. Although similar industry data is not available for Europe, we estimate aluminum wheel penetration continues to marginally increase year-over-year with further opportunity to increase. Several factors can affect the aluminum wheel penetration rate including price, fuel economy requirements and styling preferences. Although aluminum wheels are currently more costly than steel, aluminum is a lighter material than steel, which is desirable for fuel efficiency, better ride & handling and generally viewed as aesthetically superior to steel and, thus, more desirable to the OEMs and their customers. 
 Research and Development 
 Our policy is to continuously review, improve and develop our engineering capabilities to satisfy our customer requirements in the most efficient and cost-effective manner available. We strive to achieve this objective by attracting and retaining top engineering talent and by maintaining the latest state-of-the-art computer technology to support engineering development. Fully developed engineering centers located in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and in Lüdenscheid, Germany support our research and development. We also have a technical sales function at our corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan that maintains a complement of engineering staff located near some of our largest customers headquarters and engineering and purchasing offices. Aftermarket wheels are developed in Bad Dürkheim.

 Research and development costs (primarily engineering and related costs), which are expensed as incurred, are included in cost of sales in our consolidated income statements. Research and development costs during each of the last three years were $5.7 million in 2018, $7.7 million in 2017 and $3.8 million in 2016. 
 Government Regulation 
 Safety standards in the manufacture of vehicles and automotive equipment have been established under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, as amended. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal standards currently applicable to OEM suppliers and to automotive manufacturers. 
Environmental Compliance 
 Our manufacturing facilities, like most other manufacturing companies, are subject to solid waste, water and air pollution control standards mandated by federal, state and local laws. Violators of these laws are subject to fines and, in extreme cases, plant closure. We believe our facilities are in material compliance with all presently applicable standards. The cost of environmental compliance was approximately $0.7 million in 2018, $0.6 million in 2017 and $0.4 million in 2016. We expect that future environmental compliance expenditures will approximate these levels and will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles that use our products. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors - We are subject to various environmental laws of this Annual Report. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 8,000 full-time employees and 260 contract employees compared to 7,800 full-time employees and 350 contract employees at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,189 full-time employees and 682 contract employees. None of our employees in North America are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Superior Industries Europe AGs (SEAGs) subsidiary, Superior Industries Production Germany GmbH (SPG), is a member of the employers association for the metal and electronic industry in North Rhine-Westphalia e.V. (Metall und Elektro-Industrie NORDRHEIN-WESTPFALEN e.V.) and is subject to various collective bargaining agreements entered into by the employers association with the trade union IG Metall. These collective bargaining agreements include provisions relating to wages, holiday, and partial retirement. It is estimated that approximately 432 employees of SEAG employed at SPG in Germany were unionized and/or subject to collective bargaining agreements in 2018. SPG and Superior Industries Automotive Germany GmbH (operating a joint workers council) operate a statutory workers council and Superior Industries Production (Poland) Sp. z o.o. (SPP) operates a voluntary workers council. 
Fiscal Year End 
 Fiscal year 2018 started on January 1, 2018 and ended December 31, 2018. The fiscal year for 2017 consisted of the 53-week period ended December 31, 2017. Thus, 2018 reflects one less calendar week of North America operations than in 2017. The 2016 fiscal year consisted of the 52-week period ended on December 25, 2016. Historically our fiscal year ended on the last Sunday of the calendar year. While our European operations historically reported on a calendar year end, these fiscal periods aligned as of December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, both our North American and European operations are on a calendar fiscal year with each month ending on the last day of the calendar month. For convenience of presentation, all fiscal years are referred to as beginning as of January 1, and ending as of December 31, but actually reflect our financial position and results of operations for the periods described above. 
Segment Information 
 We have aligned our executive management structure, organization and operations to focus on our performance in our North American and European regions. Financial information about our operating segments is contained in

  Note 6, Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. 
 Seasonal Variations 
 The automotive industry is cyclical and varies based on the timing of consumer purchases of vehicles, which in turn varies based on a variety of factors such as general economic conditions, availability of consumer credit, interest rates and fuel costs. While there have been no significant seasonal variations in the past few years, production schedules in our industry can vary significantly from quarter to quarter to meet the scheduling demands of our customers. Typically, our aftermarket business experiences two seasonal peaks, which require substantially higher levels of production. The higher demand for aftermarket wheels from our customers occurs in March and October leading into the spring and winter peak consumer selling seasons. 
History 
 We were initially incorporated in Delaware in 1969. Our entry into the OEM aluminum wheel business in 1973 resulted from our successful development of manufacturing technology, quality control and quality assurance techniques that enabled us to satisfy the quality and volume requirements of the OEM market for aluminum wheels. The first aluminum wheel for a domestic OEM customer was a Mustang wheel for Ford. We reincorporated in California in 1994, and in 2015, we moved our headquarters from Van Nuys, California to Southfield, Michigan and reincorporated in Delaware. On May 30, 2017, we acquired a majority interest in Uniwheels AG, which is a European supplier of OEM and aftermarket aluminum wheels. Uniwheels AG was renamed in 2018 to Superior Industries Europe AG. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SUP.
