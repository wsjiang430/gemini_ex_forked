We sell our software solutions through both direct sales and indirect channels globally, leveraging the assistance of resellers, and we provide ongoing support to our customers through a global services team with experience in design, deployment and maintenance of some of the world's largest software IP networks.
We completed our acquisition of Edgewater Networks, Inc. ("Edgewater"), a market leader in Network Edge Orchestration for the distributed enterprise and UC market, in August 2018 (the "Edgewater Acquisition"), making us a software market leader in enterprise Session Border Controllers and allowing us to extend Edgewater software solutions internationally while expanding our cloud offerings and entering the SD-WAN market.
We completed our Merger with GENBAND, a global leader in NextGen software-enabled real-time communications solutions, in October 2017. Because of the Merger, we believe we improved our position to enable network transformations to IP and to cloud-based networks for service providers and enterprise customers worldwide, with a broader and deeper sales footprint, increased ability to invest in growth, more efficient and effective research and development, and a comprehensive RTC product offering.
Industry Background
Traditional TDM-based voice and data solutions are being supplanted by alternative NextGen IP-based networks and RTC software applications are being offered from the cloud in conjunction with the network and enterprise edge. Given this shift, today’s telecommunications service providers and enterprises are faced with two separate but related challenges: how to upgrade their aging and costly communications infrastructure, and how to implement new and innovative NextGen software, IP and cloud-based communications capabilities. Service providers in particular must address these challenges while at the same time responding to competition in the form of new web-scale communication providers, such as Microsoft Corp., Google LLC and Amazon.com, Inc.
To address these challenges, service providers and enterprises are modernizing their communications networks, network functions and communications applications from legacy environments to new environments using NextGen IP software, NFV, the cloud and the edge to take advantage of the many benefits that these technologies offer with an end goal of providing better and more productive communications experiences for their customers and employees.
Telecommunications Service Providers: Network Modernization
One of the most significant capital costs for telecommunications service providers has been and continues to be their infrastructure. In order to leverage past capital investments and deliver existing and new services, service providers must consolidate their infrastructure from costly, legacy infrastructures, such as the PSTN and the PLMN, into more efficient and flexible IP- and software-based network models, which are capable of driving revenue growth. Migrating from the PSTN to IP reduces real estate, power and operating costs. IP software networks allow the consolidation of voice, video and data within a single IP-based networking infrastructure over broadband and wireless access and enables new communications services, such as SIP Trunking and Hosted UCs. Similarly, modernizing mobile networks to the IMS-based 4G LTE and VoLTE networks enables mobile service providers to offer better and more efficient mobile communications experiences to end users. As consumers and businesses continue to demand more engaging and productive communications, we believe network 
7

modernization is and will continue to be essential to service providers’ ability to compete effectively in the market for telecommunications services. As such, key market drivers include:
Modernization of Networks to IP
Communication trends have been shifting for the past several years. What was once an industry built on voice communications from central office switches and PBXs on the enterprise premise is now being replaced by the use of social networks, OTT service providers, mobile applications, and hosted service providers. Consumers are increasingly turning to OTT applications (i.e., WhatsApp, Apple’s Facetime and iMessaging, or Amazon’s Alexa). This shift has created an enhanced experience for consumers, heightened expectations for future products and services, and expanded related addressable markets.
Network modernization to IP NextGen software-based systems enables service providers to add modern communications service offers that blend traditional voice messaging capabilities with contemporary features, such as video messaging, visual voicemail, mobile messaging and e-mail integration, and an accelerated time-to-market for differentiated messaging services. Network infrastructures are also undergoing a transformation to IP and the cloud, migrating from hardware-centric appliances to software solutions for voice interconnect and wide area networking.
Enterprises, large and small, are re-architecting business processes and undergoing a digital transformation, building their own virtualized software solutions in the cloud or moving their IT applications entirely to public cloud applications, and adding RTC and collaboration to their customer service solutions. These new offerings improve customer service and create an e-commerce experience that blends online applications with the in-store environment, creating a seamless experience for customers.
As a result of these evolving communications environments, the complexity of network operations is also increasing significantly, requiring sophisticated NextGen software solutions based on machine learning and analytics to provide reliable network operations.
Secure Real-time Communications
The evolution by telecommunications service providers to IP NextGen software-based RTC exposes them to new security threats, as the “walled” protection offered by their voice network infrastructures no longer exists with SIP and data-based networks. With SIP-based systems, RTC applications such as voice, video and messaging become data applications, and without appropriate security measures in place, these networks are left open to security breaches and hacks. Additionally, the move to SIP has seen an increase in fraud in service provider networks in the form of robo-dialing and toll fraud schemes.
Given these threats, there is a need for sophisticated software security solutions to protect IP-based communications networks. Service providers have relied upon the software capabilities of SBCs, which are deployed within their networks and are designed to provide robust security as well as simplify interoperability, routing and other functions as a protection measure. By its nature, the SBC controlling software is application-aware and therefore can provide sophisticated data to software-based analytics platforms to detect and thwart security breaches. In conjunction with SBCs, big data analytics and machine learning solutions can enforce a network-wide security perimeter. We believe securing networks against threats is most effective when secure software solutions are deployed within networks into existing RTC investments and combined with network-wide approaches for secure RTC.
Edge Orchestration
As service providers deliver Hosted and Cloud UC services to enterprises, they need to be able to provide those services to the enterprise via the internet and IP infrastructure and must do so with service assurance, security and reliability in a cost-effective manner. Hybrid cloud and edge orchestration software offerings enable service providers to manage enterprise edge devices remotely from their cloud or network and provide the service in a cost-effective and reliable manner. Such solutions minimize service downtime and expensive visits to enterprise customer sites via truck rolls to work on the edge devices on the enterprise customer premise.
Network Function Virtualization
In addition to shifting from traditional TDM-based voice and data networks to secure IP NextGen software networks, telecommunications service providers are increasingly moving toward NFV in order to offer new services quickly to their customers, reduce costs and compete with Web-Scale companies. NFV provides a new way to design, deploy and manage networking services by decoupling network software functions from proprietary appliances so they may run in software. This 
8

transformation enables better use of network infrastructure, creates agility, delivers rapid and elastic scaling, and enables faster time to market. Software-enabled VNFs can be deployed on generic computing platforms, hosted in private and public clouds, located in data centers, within other network elements or on computer platforms on end user premises.
Cloud and “as a Service” Models
As software communications applications are deployed in the cloud, telecommunications service providers gain the ability to offer a new class of business models commonly referred to “as a Service” solutions. These offerings include:
CPaaS: CPaaS is a cloud-based software platform that enables developers to add RTC features, such as voice, data, video, and messaging, in their own applications without requiring backend infrastructure and interfaces. CPaaS provides software developers the flexibility to “drag and drop” these features into their native applications or within web sites through simple APIs and SDKs. With CPaaS, enterprises can quickly build applications that tie RTC and their social channels to their business workflows and customer engagements. This software technology has not only moved real time communications off service provider networks, but also has greatly simplified the development and deployment of RTC capabilities.
UCaaS: Deploying NextGen UC software within the cloud helps enterprises provide flexibility and scalability for core business tasks. UCaaS features include enterprise messaging, presence technology, online meetings, team collaboration, telephony and video conferencing in lieu of traditional voice solutions, such as PBXs or carrier-based Centrex. UCaaS is also another offering for improving customer engagements and experiences.
STaaS: SIP software trunking enables service providers to bundle voice and data over a single converged IP connection and brings converged connectivity to the enterprise, creating a more economical offering than can be achieved with separate voice and data connections. STaaS delivers NextGen IP software connectivity to customers equipped with IP-PBX and UC facilities. With STaaS, customers have the flexibility to manage their own SIP trunks through simple and reliable software interfaces.
Enterprises: Network Modernization and Digital Transformation
Today’s enterprises, including multi-national corporations, SMBs and government institutions, are undergoing not only a network modernization but also a digital business transformation. The focus is shifting from person-to-person communications to contextual collaboration and omni-channel customer experiences. Within this context, enterprises need a secure, scalable and innovative NextGen software alternative to proprietary PBX and UC products. As part of their digital transformation, enterprises have adopted the cloud, open interfaces, mobile, Big Data, and analytics. Seeing the advantages and cost savings from the cloud, enterprises are migrating their communications solutions to this same environment, thereby enabling connections between business processes, communications, and collaboration.
Network Modernization
Enterprises undergoing network modernization are focused on moving from TDM-based PBXs to SIP trunking and NextGen UC software and collaboration systems while ensuring interoperability during the transformation process. In addition, enterprises in certain industries will often be subject to specific requirements or standards before a network transformation is completed. For example, governments may require Joint Interoperability Test Command ("JITC") certification for secure deployments, and healthcare providers may need to achieve HIPAA certification. 
When modernizing a network with software, the ability to interwork modern applications, such as Microsoft’s Skype for Business, with legacy analog endpoints on premises becomes essential. Additionally, software capabilities of SBCs are vital in providing interworking and survivability options. SBCs play a crucial role in securing the modern network and for NextGen UC software, which is a top priority for any enterprise. Edge SBC software devices can also play an important role in providing SD-WAN capabilities for small and distributed enterprises. Due to the growing open nature of communications environments in the enterprise, the complexity of network operations is also increasing significantly, requiring sophisticated software solutions based on machine learning and analytics to provide reliable network operations.
Digital Transformation
Successful enterprises today are focused on innovating their core product offerings and building a strategic advantage to reach and empower their customers. As technologies evolve and new mobile applications and connected devices proliferate, enterprises must adapt and innovate their communications solutions to create a “connected” experience anywhere, anytime, on any device. As part of this process, businesses are increasingly deploying “as a Service” offerings from the cloud (from either a service provider or a web-scale provider). UCaaS and CPaaS create a single software communications platform that changes 
9

the way enterprises deliver services and interact with customers. CPaaS software enables enterprises to quickly build applications that tie real time communications and their social channels to their business processes while UCaaS software delivers the underlying UC capabilities to ensure end users have the features and functionality required to enable reliable and scalable end-to-end communications.

In both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 17% of our revenue was derived from sales to one customer, Verizon Communications Inc., a service provider that provides interconnect, fixed line and mobile communications services. Verizon is transforming its TDM network from an appliance-centric network to a SIP and NFV based network, and Ribbon is playing a key role in this transformation. Our top five customers represented approximately 38% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018 and approximately 41% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017.
Competitive Conditions
Competition in the telecommunications market remains fierce. The market is shifting from a market dominated by a few large telecommunications legacy hardware equipment companies, such as Ericsson LM Telephone Company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and Nokia Corporation, to a market that is characterized by software, including network virtualization, migration to the cloud, and open interfaces. We believe this shift creates opportunities for us as well as our direct competitors in telecommunications and networking, including:

(with Nexmo, Inc. and Tokbox Inc.); and
14

Security and analytics: SecureLogix Corporation, RedShift Networks Corporation, Empirix Inc. and Oracle Corporation.
Other smaller private and public companies are also focusing on similar market opportunities. Mergers among any of the above companies or other competitors, as well as additional competitors with significant financial resources entering our markets, could further intensify competition. Mergers between service providers may also increase competition, as these reduce the number of customers and channels for products and solutions. 
To compete effectively, we must deliver innovative software solutions that provide extremely high reliability and quality; deploy and scale easily and efficiently; interoperate with existing network infrastructures and multivendor solutions; provide effective network management; are accompanied by comprehensive customer support and professional services; provide a cost-effective and space-efficient solution for enterprises and service providers; meet price competition from low cost equipment providers; and offer solutions that are timely for the market and support where the industry is heading.
Although we believe we compete favorably because our software solutions are widely deployed, highly scalable and cost-effective for our customers, some of our competitors include products in their portfolios that we do not provide and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, some of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, including relationships with our potential customers and established relationships with distribution partners.
Please see generally the risks that are discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for risks related to our customers and the competitive landscape in which we operate.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our software products, solutions and services to our customers with a direct internal sales force and also indirectly via channels and partnerships globally, leveraging the assistance of service provider channels and VARs such as Verizon Communications Inc. and Hawaiian Telecom, and distributors such as Westcon Group Inc., Ingram Micro, BlackBox and Arrow S3. Our channel partner programs are designed to serve particular markets and provide our customers with opportunities to purchase our products in combination with related services and products. For example, Ribbon is a Microsoft Gold Communications Partner and helps enterprises optimize Skype for Business (and Teams) deployments by securing those communications.
As a primary supplier of software solutions to Tier 1 service providers (a service provider that can reach every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit), we require a strong worldwide presence. We have an established sales presence throughout North America, Europe, Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, Africa and Central/South America. We also have a dedicated direct sales team focused on the enterprise, industry verticals and federal government sector in the United States.
Our marketing team is focused on promoting company brand awareness, increasing our software solutions, product, technology and services differentiation and awareness via webinars, company web sites, advertising and digital outreach, as well as generating qualified sales leads.

Please see generally the risks that are discussed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for risks related to our sales strategy.
Manufacturing
A number of our software products are deployed on appliances. Where our products contain an appliance element, we utilize contract manufacturers to source and assemble these components. Our contract manufacturers provide comprehensive manufacturing services, including assembly and testing of our products and procurement of component materials on our behalf. We believe that outsourcing the manufacturing of any necessary appliance enables us to preserve working capital, allows for greater flexibility in meeting changes in demand and enables us to be more responsive in delivering diverse product offerings to our customers. As of December 31, 2018, we outsourced the manufacturing of our appliance products to four manufacturers, two upon which we primarily rely. However, we are currently in the process of transitioning our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer. We and our contract manufacturers purchase several key components of our appliance products, including commercial digital signal processors, from single or limited sources. We purchase these components on a purchase order basis.
15

Our purchases of direct materials and components for manufacture of approximately $75 million in 2018 (approximately $64 million excluding the effects of the Edgewater Acquisition) increased compared with approximately $38 million in 2017 due to the inclusion of the GENBAND business since October 27, 2017 and Edgewater business since August 3, 2018 in our consolidated results. Going forward, we expect our overall trend of a reduction in direct material purchases to continue as the software richness within our products increases while the remaining appliance content declines.
Please see generally the risks that are discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for risks related to our manufacturing operations and use of contract manufacturers.
Research and Development
We believe that strong software product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional security and network modernization features and maintaining comprehensive software and service offerings. Our research and development process leverages innovative technology in response to market data and customer feedback. As part of this process, we regularly review research and software development investments in our products and balance them against market demand.
We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers with significant transcoding, UC application and networking industry experience. Our engineers have deep experience in software design and development. Our engineering effort is focused on NextGen UC, NFV, security and cloud-based architecture software product development.
As of December 31, 2018, we maintained research and development offices in Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Texas, New Jersey and North Carolina in the United States, as well as Canada, India and the United Kingdom.
Seasonality
We have experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience increases in order volume in the fourth quarter due to greater spending on operating and capital expenditures by our service provider customers. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the beginning of the calendar year, when our service provider customers are finalizing their annual budgets, which may result in lower revenue in the first quarter. These seasonal effects may vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future operating results.
Backlog
We sell products and services pursuant to purchase orders issued under master agreements that provide standard terms and conditions that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale. These agreements typically do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed quantities, nor do they generally require upfront cash deposits. At any given time, we have orders for products that have not yet been shipped and for services (including our customer support obligations) that have not yet been performed. We also have orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed but have not yet been accepted by the customer under the applicable purchase terms. We include both of these situations in our calculation of backlog.
A backlogged order may not result in revenue in the quarter in which it was booked, and the actual revenue recognized in a quarter may not equal the total amount of related backlog. In addition, although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be canceled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty. Therefore, we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any future period.
We have begun to derive, and expect to continue to derive, a greater percentage of our revenue from the enterprise market and through sales channels where speed of fulfillment is essential to winning business. Consequently, we expect to earn a lower relative percentage of our total business from large service provider orders that are delivered over multiple quarters and years and that our backlog going forward will diminish both as a comparable metric to prior periods and as a relative percentage of total revenue (both service provider and enterprise). Our backlog was approximately $340 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $370 million at December 31, 2017. Our prior period amount has been conformed to our current period presentation following the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and no longer includes purchase orders where product delivery is not expected within twelve months.

Segment Information
We operate in a single segment. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. To date, our chief operating decision maker has made such decisions and assessed performance at the company level, as one segment. Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief Executive Officer.
Our Company History
We were organized as a Delaware corporation on May 19, 2017, initially under the name Solstice Sapphire Investments, Inc., for the purpose of effecting the merger of Sonus and GENBAND. The Merger occurred on October 27, 2017. Upon completion of the Merger, Sonus and GENBAND became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Solstice Sapphire Investments, Inc., which concurrently changed its name to Sonus Networks, Inc. On November 28, 2017, Sonus Networks, Inc. changed its name to Ribbon Communications Inc. Ribbon succeeded to and continues to operate, directly or indirectly, the then existing businesses of Sonus and GENBAND.
