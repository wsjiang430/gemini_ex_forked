Item 1. Business.
General
 Dorman Products, Inc. was incorporated in Pennsylvania in October 1978. As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, “Dorman”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refers to Dorman Products, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 We believe we are a leading supplier of replacement parts and fasteners for passenger cars, light trucks, and heavy duty trucks in the automotive aftermarket. As of December 29, 2018, we marketed approximately 77,000 unique parts as compared to approximately 70,000 as of December 30, 2017, many of which we designed and engineered. Unique parts exclude private label stock keeping units (“SKU’s”) and other variations in how we market, package and distribute our products, but include unique parts of acquired companies. We believe we are a leading aftermarket supplier of original equipment “dealer exclusive” items. Original equipment “dealer exclusive” items are those which were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or used parts from salvage yards and include, among other parts, intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, window regulators, radiator fan assemblies, tire pressure monitor sensors, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers and complex electronics modules. Fasteners include such items as oil drain plugs, wheel bolts, and wheel lug nuts.  Approximately 84% of our products are sold under brands that we own and the remainder of our products are sold for resale under customers' private labels, other brands or in bulk. Our products are sold primarily in the United States through automotive aftermarket retailers (such as Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (“Advance”), AutoZone, Inc. (“AutoZone”), and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (“O’Reilly”)), national, regional and local warehouse distributors (such as Genuine Parts Co. – NAPA (“NAPA”)) and specialty markets, and salvage yards. We also distribute automotive replacement parts internationally, with sales primarily into Canada and Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.  
 The Automotive Aftermarket
 The automotive replacement parts market has two components: parts for passenger cars and light trucks, which accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $296.0 billion in 20181, and parts for medium and heavy duty trucks, which accounted for projected industry sales of approximately $96.4 billion in 20181. We market products primarily for passenger cars and light trucks, including those with diesel engines and, since 2012, for medium and heavy duty trucks. Two distinct groups of end-users buy replacement vehicle (automotive and truck) parts: (i) individual consumers, who purchase parts to perform "do-it-yourself" repairs on their own vehicles; and (ii) professional installers, which include vehicle repair shops and the dealership service departments.  The individual consumer market is typically supplied through retailers and through the retail arms of warehouse distributors. Vehicle repair shops generally purchase parts through local independent parts wholesalers and through national parts distributors. Automobile dealership service departments generally obtain parts through the distribution systems of vehicle manufacturers and specialized national and regional parts distributors.
 Spending in the light vehicle aftermarket can be generally grouped into three categories: discretionary, maintenance, and repair.  Discretionary, such as accessories and performance, tends to move in-line with consumer discretionary spending.  Maintenance is composed of products and services, such as oil and oil changes, and tends to be less correlated with discretionary spending.  The repair category consists mainly of replacement parts which fail over time and tends to be less cyclical as it is largely comprised of parts necessary for a vehicle to function properly or safely.  The majority of our products fall into the repair category. The increasing complexity of automobiles and the number of different makes and models of automobiles have resulted in a significant increase in the number of products required to service the domestic and foreign automotive fleet. Accordingly, the number of parts required to be carried by retailers and wholesale distributors has increased substantially. The requirement to include more products in inventory and the significant consolidation among distributors of automotive replacement parts have in turn resulted in larger distributors.

Retailers and others who purchase aftermarket automotive repair and replacement parts for resale are constrained to a finite amount of space in which to display and stock products. Thus, the reputation for quality, customer service, and line profitability which a supplier enjoys are significant factors in a purchaser's decision as to which product lines to carry in the limited space available. Further, because of the efficiencies achieved through the ability to order all or part of a complete line of products from one supplier (with possible volume discounts), as opposed to satisfying the same requirements through a variety of different sources, retailers and other purchasers of automotive parts seek to purchase products from fewer but stronger suppliers.

We group our products into four major classes: power-train, automotive body, chassis, and hardware.  The following table represents each of the four classes as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years:
 
 
 | Percentage of Net Sales | 
----------------+-------------------------+----
 | Year Ended | 
 | December 29, 2018 | | | December 30, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
Power-train | | 40 | % | | 41 | % | 41 | %
Chassis | | 29 | % | | 27 | % | 25 | %
Automotive Body | | 26 | % | | 27 | % | 29 | %
Hardware | | 5 | % | | 5 | % | 5 | %
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
Our power-train product line includes intake and exhaust manifolds, cooling products, harmonic balancers, fluid lines, fluid reservoirs, connectors, 4 wheel drive components and axles, drain plugs, and other engine, transmission and axle components. Our line of automotive body products include door handles and hinges, window lift motors, window regulators, switches and handles, wiper components, lighting, electrical, and other interior and exterior automotive body components. Chassis products include control arms, brake hardware and hydraulics, wheel and axle hardware, suspension arms, knuckles, links, bushings, and other suspension, steering, and brake components.  Hardware products include threaded bolts, auto body and home fasteners, automotive and home electrical wiring components, and other hardware assortments and merchandise.  
 We warrant our products against certain defects in material and workmanship when used as designed on the vehicle on which it was originally installed. We offer a limited lifetime warranty on most of our products. Our warranty limits the customer’s remedy to the repair or replacement of the part that is defective. 
 Product Development
 Product development and continuous innovation are central to our business. The development of a broad range of products, many of which are not conveniently or economically available elsewhere, has enabled us to grow to our present size and is an important driver to our future growth. Our product strategy has been to design and engineer products, many of which are better and easier to install and/or use than the original parts they replace and to commercialize automotive parts for the broadest possible range of uses. New product ideas are reviewed by our product management staff, as well as by members of the supply chain, sales, finance, marketing, legal, and administrative staffs. The following table represents the number of unique parts we introduced for each of the last three fiscal years:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
----------------------------------------------------+------+-------+------+-------+-----
New to the aftermarket | | 1,716 | | 1,192 | | 1,255
Line extensions (many of which are exclusive items) | | 3,827 | | 2,887 | | 2,965
Total unique parts introduced | | 5,543 | | 4,079 | | 4,220

 
Through careful evaluation of high failure-prone parts, exacting design and precise engineering, we are frequently able to offer products which fit a broader range of makes and models, as well as a wider range of application years than the original equipment parts they replace. One such innovation is our HVAC climate control module specifically designed to provide optimal performance at a more economical price than a dealer replacement part. Our product development included consolidating multiple year, make and model vehicle solutions, to reduce customer inventory complexity, with a direct replacement/fit of matching design to the original equipment part.  The development process ensures ease of installation to save technician time.  Extensive on-vehicle testing was conducted to confirm proper function across all vehicle applications.
 Our new truck bed floor support system provides a time-saving and cost-efficient repair solution for rusted original bed supports across a number of truck platforms ranging from 1999-2018 models. There were limited viable solutions for repairing rusted truck bed floor and support components to deliver the required functionality for these vehicles.  Dorman’s direct replacement truck bed floor supports provide a superior economic solution by replacing 
 5


only the failed original supports, instead of the entire truck bed assembly. Dorman’s truck bed floor support includes all necessary components needed for a complete installation.
 Additionally, Dorman introduced a line of nitrogen oxide sensors which represent another new-to the-aftermarket solution which we have pioneered, leveraging a strong team of mechanical and software engineers to redesign this emission sensor to meet stringent, regulated EPA standards. We designed, developed and engineered an aftermarket solution to meet the needs of the end technician servicing diesel fueled vehicles. The NOx (Nitrogen Oxide) Sensor is a high-temperature sensor designed to detect NOx levels in diesel-fueled vehicles that must comply with state emissions regulations. As state emissions requirements become more demanding for diesel vehicles, it is imperative to have a quality sensor to notify the driver when high amounts of NOx levels are in the engine.
 Ideas for expansion of our product lines arise through a variety of sources. We maintain an in-house product management staff that routinely generates ideas for new parts and the expansion of existing lines. Further, we maintain an "800" telephone number and an Internet site for "new product ideas" and receive, through our sales force, product development team, and our website, many ideas from our customers and end-users as to which types of presently unavailable parts the ultimate consumers are seeking.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market our products to three groups of purchasers who in turn supply individual consumers and professional installers. Our products are also available in our customer’s retail stores, on our customer’s websites, and through warehouse distributors. Based on net sales to our customers as of December 29, 2018:
 (i) approximately 49% of our revenues were generated from sales to automotive aftermarket retailers (such as, Advance, AutoZone and O'Reilly), local independent parts wholesalers and national general merchandise chain retailers. We sell many of our products to virtually all major chains of automotive aftermarket retailers;
 (ii) approximately 46% of our revenues were generated from sales to automotive parts distributors (such as NAPA), which may be local, regional or national in scope, and which may also engage in retail sales; and
 (iii) the balance of our revenues (approximately 5%) are generated from international sales and sales to special markets, which include, among others, mass merchants (such as Wal-Mart), salvage yards and the parts distribution systems of parts manufacturers.
 We use a number of different methods to sell our products. Our direct sales and sales support staff of over 80 people solicits purchases of our products directly from customers, as well as manages the activities of independent manufacturers’ representative agencies worldwide. We use independent manufacturers’ representative agencies to help service existing automotive retail, automotive and heavy duty parts distribution customers, providing frequent on-site contact. We increase sales by securing new customers, by adding new product lines and expanding product selection within existing customers.
 Our sales efforts are not directed merely at selling individual products, but rather more broadly towards selling our entire product portfolio in an effort to make our customers a destination for new to the aftermarket products.
 We prepare a number of on-line catalogs, application guides, digital marketing tools, training materials and videos designed to describe our products and other applications as well as to train our customers' sales teams in the promotion and sale of our products. Catalogs of all our parts are available on our website.  
 We currently service more than 2,500 active accounts.  During fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, four customers (Advance, AutoZone, NAPA, and O'Reilly) each accounted for more than 10% of net sales and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 63% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 61% in fiscal 2017, and 60% in fiscal 2016.   
 Manufacturing and Procurement
 Substantially all of our products are manufactured by third parties. We engage professional manufacturing firms around the world to develop and manufacture products according to our performance and design 
 6


specifications, using tooling that we own. In fiscal 2018, as a percentage of our total dollar volume of purchases, approximately 23% of our products were purchased from various suppliers throughout the United States and the balance of our products were purchased directly from suppliers in a variety of foreign countries. Our global supplier network provides access to a broad array of manufacturing capabilities and technologies while limiting our dependency on any single source of supply.  While our supplier selection and sourcing programs will continue to leverage our strategic manufacturing firms, for a substantial portion of our product portfolio, we also have qualified alternative sources available to provide additional support and capacity if needed. We make a concerted effort to build and nurture strong, healthy relationships with our suppliers. We purchase automotive products in substantial volumes from over 260 suppliers. For fiscal 2018, no single manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of total product purchases. 
Packaging, Inventory and Shipping
 Finished products are received at one or more of our facilities, depending on the type of part. It is our practice to inspect samples of shipments based upon supplier performance. If cleared, these shipments of finished parts are logged into our computerized production tracking systems and staged for packaging, if necessary. 
 We employ a variety of custom-designed packaging machines which include blister sealing, skin film sealing, clamshell sealing, bagging and boxing lines. Packaged product contains our label (or a private label), a part number, a universal packaging bar code suitable for electronic scanning, a description of the part and, if appropriate, installation instructions. Products are also sold in bulk to automotive parts manufacturers and packagers. Computerized tracking systems, mechanical counting devices and experienced workers combine to assure that the proper variety and numbers of parts meet the correct packaging materials at the appropriate places and times to produce the required quantities of finished products.
 Packaged inventory is stocked in the warehouse portions of our facilities and is organized to facilitate the most efficient methods of retrieving product to fill customer orders. We strive to maintain a level of inventory to adequately meet current customer order demand with additional inventory to satisfy new customer orders and special programs. 
 We ship our products from each of our locations by contract carrier, common carrier or parcel service. Products are generally shipped to the customer's main warehouses for redistribution within their network. In certain circumstances, at the request of the customer, we ship directly to the customer's warehouses, stores or other locations either via smaller direct ship orders or consolidated store orders that are cross docked.
 Competition
 The replacement automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Various competitive factors affecting the automotive aftermarket are price, product quality, breadth of product line, range of applications and customer service. Substantially all of our products are subject to competition with similar products manufactured by other manufacturers of aftermarket automotive repair and replacement parts. Some of these competitors are divisions and subsidiaries of companies much larger than us, and possess a longer history of operations and greater financial and other resources than we do. We also face competition from automobile manufacturers who sell through their dealerships many of the same replacement parts that we sell, although these manufacturers generally sell parts only for cars they produce.  Our customers may also be successful in sourcing some of our products directly from suppliers.  Further, some of our private label customers also compete with us.
Seasonality
 Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate.
Proprietary Rights
 7


While we take steps to register our trademarks and copyrights when possible, we believe that our business is not heavily dependent on such trademark and copyright registrations. Similarly, while we actively seek patent protection for the products and improvements which we develop, we do not believe that patent protection is critical to the success of our business. Rather, the quality, price, customer service and availability of our products is critical to our success.
Employees
 As noted below, at December 29, 2018, we had 2,370 employees worldwide, essentially all of which were employed full-time. “Operations” consists of employees engaged in production, inventory and quality control. “Product Development” includes employees involved in product development and purchasing. “Quality and Engineering” consists of employees involved in internal and external quality management, manufacturing engineering, design, and testing. “Sales” includes employees employed in sales and customer service. “Administration” includes executive officers, finance, legal and human resources. The number of employees will be affected by planned and unplanned open positions at any point in time.
