INTRODUCTION
 
We are an early entrant in the Digital Asset market and one of the first U.S. publicly traded companies to be involved with Digital Assets and blockchain technologies. To our knowledge, we are one of a few public companies intending to acquire both Digital Assets and a controlling interest in one or more businesses in the Digital Asset and blockchain industries.
OUR BUSINESS
 
Subject to additional financing, the Company plans to acquire additional Digital Assets to provide investors with indirect ownership of Digital Assets that are not securities, such as bitcoin and ether. The Company intends to acquire Digital Assets through open market purchases. Additionally, the Company may acquire Digital Assets by resuming its transaction verification services business through outsourced data centers and earning rewards in Digital Assets by securing their respective blockchains. We are not limiting our assets to a single type of Digital Asset and may purchase a variety of Digital Assets that appear to benefit our investors, subject to the limitations contained within this report regarding Digital Securities. The Company is also seeking to acquire controlling interests in businesses in the blockchain industry as further described in this report.
 
The Company has not participated in any initial coin offerings as it believes most of the offerings entail the offering of Digital Securities and require registration under the Securities Act and under state securities laws or can only be sold to accredited investors in the United States. Since about July 2017, initial coin offerings using Digital Securities have been (or should be) limited to accredited investors. Because we cannot qualify as an accredited investor, we do not intend to acquire coins in initial coin offerings or from purchasers in such offerings. Further, the Company does not intend to participate in registered or unregistered initial coin offerings. The Company will carefully review its purchases of Digital Securities to avoid violating the 1940 Act and seek to reduce potential liabilities under the federal securities laws. See “Risk Factors” at page 16 and “Business” at pages 3-16.
 
Digital asset blockchains are typically maintained by a network of participants which run servers which secure their blockchain. The market is rapidly evolving and there can be no assurances that we will be competitive with industry participants that have or may have greater resources than us.
 
Blockchain Technology and Digital Asset Initiatives
 
We are also focused on Digital Assets and blockchain technologies. Subject to additional financing, we plan to continue to evaluate other strategic opportunities including acquiring controlling interests in business in this rapidly evolving sector in an effort to enhance shareholder value.
 
Even though the prices of Digital Assets have fallen substantially and there remains some regulatory uncertainty, we believe that businesses using blockchain technology and those involved with Digital Assets such as bitcoin and ether, offer upside opportunity and are the types of opportunities that we may pursue.
 
Our current framework or criteria is to seek and evaluate acquisition targets in the blockchain and Digital Asset sector which (i) align with our business model of acquiring Digital Assets or acquiring a controlling interest in one or more blockchain technology related business ventures, and (ii) have sufficient capital to provide working capital and cover public company expenses. As disclosed in this report we have limited cash, and accordingly as a critical framework element are seeking acquisition targets with sufficient capital which may help us sustain our operations without having us rely on toxic funding structures. Our acquisition activities are spearheaded by Charles Allen, our Chief Executive Officer who regularly communicates with Mr. David Garrity, one of our independent directors who is also seeking acquisition targets.
 
Transaction Verification Service Business (digital asset mining e.g. bitcoin, Suspended)
 
We believe that with additional funding we may be able to resume our transaction verification services business (Digital Asset mining e.g. bitcoin) and believe this may provide revenue growth. However, given the current network difficulties and price levels to mine both ethereum and bitcoin we do not believe mining offers a positive return on investment at present. We plan to monitor the blockchain networks and subject to additional funding re-enter the mining business when we believe a positive return on investment is achievable. If we are successful in resuming our transaction verification services business, we anticipate utilizing outsourced data centers and may diversify operations by securing other blockchains in addition to bitcoins. If we resume our mining operations, we do not intend to actively trade the Digital Assets but rather hold them for our own account and sell them for U.S. dollars or other currencies including virtual currencies.
 
Transaction verification entails running ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) servers or other specialized servers which solve a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to a blockchain and thereby confirm Digital Asset transactions. A party which is successful in adding a block to the blockchain, is awarded a fixed number of Digital Assets for our effort.

Going Concern
 
Because of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, our independent auditors have indicated in their report on our December 31, 2018 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW (BITCOIN AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES)
 
Introduction to Bitcoins and the Bitcoin Network
 
A bitcoin is one type of a Digital Asset that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security that is known as the “Bitcoin Network.” The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the “Blockchain,” and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Bitcoins can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, at rates determined on Bitcoin Exchanges or in individual end-user-to-end-user transactions under a barter system.
 
Bitcoins are “stored” or reflected on the digital transaction ledger known as the “Blockchain,” which is a digital file stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all bitcoins in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns them. The Bitcoin Network and Bitcoin software programs can interpret the Blockchain to determine the exact bitcoin balance, if any, of any digital wallet listed in the Blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the Bitcoin Network.
 
The Blockchain is comprised of a digital file, downloaded and stored, in whole or in part, on all bitcoin users’ software programs. The file includes all blocks that have been solved by miners and is updated to include new blocks as they are solved. As each newly solved block refers back to and “connects” with the immediately prior solved block, the addition of a new block adds to the Blockchain in a manner similar to a new link being added to a chain. Each new block records outstanding bitcoin transactions, and outstanding transactions are settled and validated through such recording, the Blockchain represents a complete, transparent and unbroken history of all transactions on the Bitcoin Network.
 
The Bitcoin Network is decentralized and does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of bitcoins. Rather, bitcoins are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a “mining” process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule. The value of bitcoins is determined by the supply of and demand for bitcoins in the Bitcoin Exchange Market (and in private end-user-to-end-user transactions), as well as the number of merchants that accept them. As bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network by any user’s bitcoin software and bitcoins can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are little or no transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Third party service providers such as Bitcoin Exchanges and bitcoin third party payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting, or facilitating the conversion of, bitcoins to or from fiat currency.
 
Overview of the Bitcoin Network’s Operations
 
In order to own, transfer or use bitcoins, a person generally must have Internet access to connect to the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoin transactions between parties occur very rapidly (within several seconds) and may be made directly between end-users without the need for a third-party intermediary, although there are entities that provide third-party intermediary services. To prevent the possibility of double-spending a single bitcoin, a user must notify the Bitcoin Network of the transaction by broadcasting the transaction data to its network peers. The Bitcoin Network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Blockchain, which is publicly accessible and transparent. This memorialization and verification against double-spending is accomplished through the bitcoin mining process, which adds “blocks” of data, including recent transaction information, to the Blockchain.
Brief Description of Bitcoin Transfers
 
Prior to engaging in bitcoin transactions, a user generally must first install on its computer or mobile device a bitcoin software program that will allow the user to generate a digital “wallet” (analogous to a bitcoin account). Alternatively, a user may retain a third party to create a digital wallet to be used for the same purpose. Each such wallet includes one or more unique digital addresses and verification system consisting of a “public key” and a “private key,” which are mathematically related.
 
In a bitcoin transaction, the bitcoin recipient must provide its digital address, which serves as a routing number to the recipient’s digital wallet on the Blockchain, to the party initiating the transfer. The recipient, however, does not make public or provide to the sender its related private key. The payor, or “spending” party, does reveal its public key in signing and verifying its spending transaction to the Blockchain.

Neither the recipient nor the sender reveal their digital wallet’s private key in a transaction, because the private key authorizes access to, and transfer of, the funds in that digital wallet to other users. In the data packets propagated from a user’s bitcoin software program onto the Bitcoin Network to allow transaction confirmation, the sending party must “sign” its transaction with a data code derived from entering the private key into a “hashing algorithm.” The hashing algorithm converts the private key into a digital signature, which signature serves as validation that the transaction has been authorized by the holder of the digital wallet’s private key.
 
Transaction Verification (Digital Asset Mining) & Creation of New Digital Assets
 
Transaction Verification Process (Mining Process)
 
The process by which bitcoins are “mined” results in new blocks being added to the Blockchain and new bitcoins being issued to the miners. Miners engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the Blockchain and thereby confirm bitcoin transactions included in that block’s data. Miners that are successful in adding a block to the Blockchain are automatically awarded a fixed number of bitcoins for their effort; we also refer to this process of receiving the aforementioned award as transaction verification services. This reward system is the method by which new bitcoins enter into circulation to the public and is accomplished in the added block through the notation of the new bitcoin creation and their allocation to the successful miner’s digital wallet. To begin mining, a user can download and run Bitcoin Network mining software, which, like regular Bitcoin Network software programs, turns the user’s computer into a “node” on the Bitcoin Network that validates blocks.
 
All bitcoin transactions are recorded in blocks added to the Blockchain. Each block contains the details of some or all of the most recent transactions that are not memorialized in prior blocks, a reference to the most recent prior block, and a record of the award of bitcoins to the miner who added the new block. In order to add blocks to the Blockchain, a miner must map an input data set (i.e., a reference to the immediately preceding block in the Blockchain, plus a block of the most recent Bitcoin Network transactions and an arbitrary number called a “nonce”) to a desired output data set of predetermined length (“hash value”) using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm. To “solve” or “calculate” a block, a miner must repeat this computation with a different nonce until the miner generates a SHA-256 hash of a block’s header that has a value less than or equal to the current target set by the Bitcoin Network. Each unique block can only be solved and added to the Blockchain by one miner; therefore, all individual miners and mining pools on the Bitcoin Network are engaged in a competitive process and are incentivized to increase their computing power to improve their likelihood of solving for new blocks.
 
The cryptographic hash function that a miner uses is one-way only and is, in effect, irreversible: hash values are easy to generate from input data (i.e., valid recent network transactions, Blockchain and nonce), but neither a miner nor participant is able to determine the original input data solely from the hash value. As a result, generating a new valid block with a header less than the target prescribed by the Bitcoin Network is initially difficult for a miner, yet other nodes can easily confirm a proposed block by running the hash function just once with the proposed nonce and other input data. A miner’s proposed block is added to the Blockchain once a majority of the nodes on the Bitcoin Network confirms the miner’s work, and the miner that solved such block receives the reward of a fixed number of bitcoins (plus any transaction fees paid by transferors whose transactions are recorded in the block). Therefore, “hashing” is akin to a mathematical lottery, and miners that have devices with greater processing power (i.e., the ability to make more hash calculations per second) are more likely to be successful miners because they can generate more hashes or “entries” into that lottery.
 
As more miners join the Bitcoin Network and its processing power increases, the Bitcoin Network automatically adjusts the complexity of the block-solving equation in an effort to set distribution such that newly-created blocks will be added to the Blockchain, on average, approximately every ten minutes. Processing power is added to the Bitcoin Network at irregular rates that have grown rapidly from early 2013 through 2017.
 
Incentives for Transaction Verification (Mining)
 
Miners dedicate substantial resources to mining. Given the increasing difficulty of the target established by the Bitcoin Network, current miners must invest in expensive mining devices with adequate processing power to hash at a competitive rate. The first mining devices were standard home computers; however, mining computers are currently designed solely for mining purposes. Such devices included ASIC machines built by specialized companies like BitFury, Bitmain Technologies, 21 Inc., Canaan Creative, Halong Mining, and BW. Miners also incur substantial electricity costs in order to continuously power and cool their devices while solving for a new block.
 
The Bitcoin Network is designed in such a way that the reward for adding new blocks to the Blockchain decreases over time and the production (and reward) of bitcoins will eventually cease. Once such reward ceases, it is expected that miners will demand compensation in the form of transaction fees to ensure that there is adequate incentive for them to continue mining. The amount of transaction fees will be based upon the structural requirements necessary to provide sufficient revenue to incentivize miners, as counterbalanced by the need to retain sufficient bitcoin users (and transactions) to make mining profitable.

Though not free from doubt, bitcoin industry participants have expressed a belief that transaction fees would be enforced through (i) mining operators collectively refusing to record transactions that do not include a payment of a transaction fee or (ii) the updating of bitcoin software to require a minimum transaction fee payment. Under a regime whereby large miners require fees to record transactions, a transaction where the spending party did not include a payment of transaction fees would not be recorded on the Blockchain until a miner who does not require transaction fees solves for a new block (thereby recording all outstanding transaction records for which it has received data). If popular bitcoin software for digital wallets were to require a minimum transaction fee, users of such programs would be required to include such fees; however, because of the open-source nature of the Bitcoin Network, there may be no way to require that all digital wallets include minimum transaction fees for spending transactions. Alternatively, a future Bitcoin Network software update could simply build a small transaction fee payment into all spending transactions (e.g., by deducting a fractional number of bitcoins from all transactions on the Bitcoin Network as transaction fees).
 
The Bitcoin Network protocol already includes transaction fee rules and the mechanics for awarding transaction fees to the miners that solve for blocks in which the fees are recorded; however, users currently may opt not to pay transaction fees (depending on the bitcoin software they use) and miners may choose not to enforce the transaction fee rules since, at present, the bitcoin rewards are far more substantial than transaction fees. On October 11, 2018, transaction fees accounted for approximately 0.92 percent of miners’ total revenue, though the percentage of revenue represented by transaction fees is not static and fluctuates based on the number of transactions for which sending users include transaction fees, the levels of those transaction fees and the number of transactions a miner includes in its solved blocks. Typically, transactions do not have difficulty being recorded if transaction fees are not included. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, much of the world’s bitcoin mining occurs in China; it is unclear whether the Chinese crackdown on Digital Assets will impact mining activities or whether if it does, what the adverse effects will be.
 
Mining Pools
 
The Bitcoin Network’s mining protocol was created in a manner to make it more difficult to solve for new blocks as the processing power dedicated to mining increases (in order to maintain the 10 minute per block solution time average). Therefore, the difficulty of finding a valid hash value has grown exponentially since the first blocks were mined. Currently, the likelihood that an individual acting alone will be able to mine bitcoins is extremely low. As a result, mining “pools” have developed in which multiple miners act cohesively and combine their processing power to solve blocks. When a pool solves a new block, the participating mining pool members split the resulting reward based on the processing power they each contributed to solve for such block. Mining pools provide participants with access to smaller, but steadier and more frequent, bitcoin payouts. The Company monitors the Blockchain network and, based on the information we collected from our network access, as of January 24, 2019, the largest three mining pools were, an unknown pool, BTC.TOP, and BTC, which, when aggregated, represented approximately 53 percent of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network (as calculated by determining the percentage of blocks mined by each such pool over the prior month).
Mathematically Controlled Supply
 
The method for creating new bitcoins is mathematically controlled in a manner so that the supply of bitcoins grows at a limited rate pursuant to a pre-set schedule. The number of bitcoins awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved every 210,000 blocks. Thus, the current fixed reward for solving a new block is 12.5 bitcoins per block and the reward will decrease by half to become 6.25 bitcoins around June 2020 (based on estimates of the rate of block solution calculated by BitcoinClock.com). This deliberately controlled rate of bitcoin creation means that the number of bitcoins in existence will never exceed 21 million and that bitcoins cannot be devalued through excessive production unless the Bitcoin Network’s source code (and the underlying protocol for bitcoin issuance) is altered. The Company monitors the Blockchain network and, as of January 24, 2019, based on the information we collected from our network access 17.5 million bitcoins have been mined.
 
Modifications to the Bitcoin Protocol
 
Bitcoin is an open source project (i.e., a product whose source code is freely available to the public and that utilizes crowdsourcing to identify possible issues, problems and defects) and there is no official developer or group of developers that controls the Bitcoin Network. The Bitcoin Network’s development is overseen by a core group of developers, which varies from time to time (“Core Developers”). The Core Developers are able to access and can propose alterations to the Bitcoin Network source code hosted on GitHub, an online service and forum used to share and develop open source code. Other programmers have access to and can propose changes to the bitcoin source code on GitHub, but the Core Developers have an elevated level of influence over the process. As a result, the Core Developers are responsible for quasi-official releases of updates and other changes to the Bitcoin Network’s source code. Users and miners must accept any changes made to the Bitcoin Network (including those proposed by the Core Developers) by downloading the proposed modification of the source code.
 
A modification of the source code is only effective with respect to the bitcoin users and miners that download it. Consequently, as a practical matter, a modification to the source code (e.g., a proposal to increase the 21 million total limit on bitcoins or to reduce the average confirmation time target from 10 minutes per block) only becomes part of the Bitcoin Network if accepted by participants collectively having a substantial majority of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network. If a modification is accepted only by a percentage of users and miners, a division in the Bitcoin Network will occur such that one network will run the pre-modification source code and the other network will run the modified source code; such a division is known as a “fork” in the Bitcoin Network. It should be noted that, although their power to amend the source code is effectively subject to the approval of users and miners, the Core Developers have substantial influence over the development of the Bitcoin Network and the direction of the bitcoin community.

Other Blockchain Technologies
 
Core Development of the bitcoin source code has increasingly focused on modifications of the bitcoin protocol to allow non-financial and next generation uses (sometimes referred to as Bitcoin 2.0 projects). These uses include smart contracts and distributed registers built into, built atop or pegged alongside the Blockchain. For example, the white paper for Blockstream, a program of which Core Developers Jeff Garzik and Gregory Maxwell are a part, calls for the use of “pegged sidechains” to develop programming environments that are built within block chain ledgers that can interact with and rely on the security of the Bitcoin Network and Blockchain, while remaining independent thereof. We are actively evaluating other Blockchain technologies that relate to Bitcoin 2.0 projects. At this time, Bitcoin 2.0 projects remain in early stages and have not been materially integrated into the Blockchain or Bitcoin Network.
Bitcoin Value
 
Bitcoins are an example of a Digital Asset that is not a fiat currency (i.e., a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization) and are not backed by hard assets or other credit. As a result, the value of bitcoins is determined by the value that various market participants place on bitcoins through their transactions.
Exchange Valuation
 
Due to the peer-to-peer framework of the Bitcoin Network and the protocols thereunder, transferors and recipients of bitcoins are able to determine the value of the bitcoins transferred by mutual agreement or barter with respect to their transactions. As a result, the most common means of determining the value of a bitcoin is by surveying one or more Bitcoin Exchanges where bitcoins are publicly bought, sold and traded (i.e., the Bitcoin Exchange Market).
 
On each Bitcoin Exchange, bitcoins are traded with publicly disclosed valuations for each transaction, measured by one or more fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, the Euro or the Chinese Yuan. Bitcoin Exchanges typically report publicly on their site the valuation of each transaction and bid and ask prices for the purchase or sale of bitcoins. Although each Bitcoin Exchange has its own market price, it is expected that most Bitcoin Exchanges’ market prices should be relatively consistent with the Bitcoin Exchange Market average since market participants can choose the Bitcoin Exchange on which to buy or sell bitcoins (i.e., exchange shopping). Arbitrage between the prices on various Bitcoin Exchanges is possible, but the imposition of fees and fiat currency deposit/withdrawal policies appears to have, at times, prevented an active arbitrage mechanism among users on some Bitcoin Exchanges. For example, delayed fiat currency withdrawals imposed by Mt. Gox resulted in Mt. Gox trading at a premium of up to 10 to 20 percent for several months through January 2014. In February 2014, Mt. Gox suspended trading, closed its website and exchange service, and filed for a form of bankruptcy protection from creditors called minjisaisei, or civil rehabilitation, to allow courts to seek a buyer. In April 2014, Mt. Gox began liquidation proceedings.
 
Even in the absence of large trading fees and fiat currency deposit/withdrawal policies, price differentials across Bitcoin Exchanges remain. For disclosure on the accounting of Digital Assets, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” at page 18.
 
Forms of Attack Against the Bitcoin Network
 
Exploitation of Flaws in the Bitcoin Network’s Source Code
 
As with any other computer code, the Bitcoin Network source code may contain certain flaws. Several errors and defects have been found and corrected, including those that disabled some functionality for users, exposed users’ information, or allowed users to create multiple views of the Bitcoin Network. Such flaws have been discovered and quickly corrected by the Core Developers or the bitcoin community, thus demonstrating one of the advantages of open source codes that are available to the public: open source codes rely on transparency to promote community-sourced identification and solution of problems within the code.
 
Reports of flaws in or exploitations of the source code that allow malicious actors to take or create money in contravention of known Bitcoin Network rules have been exceedingly rare. For example, in 2010, a hacker or group of hackers exploited a flaw in the Bitcoin Network source code that allowed them to generate 184 billion bitcoins in a transaction and send them to two digital wallet addresses. However, the bitcoin community and developers identified and reversed the manipulated transactions within approximately five hours, and the flaw was corrected with an updated version of the bitcoin protocol. Another addressed issue with the Bitcoin Network source code, “transaction malleability” was addressed by the Core Developers in a March 2013 software update. The Core Developers, in conjunction with other developers and miners, work continuously to ensure that flaws are quickly fixed or removed.
 
Greater than Fifty Percent of Network Computational Power
 
Malicious actors can structure an attack whereby such actor gains control of more than half of the Bitcoin Network’s processing power or “hashrate.” Computer scientists and cryptographers believe that the immense collective processing power of the Bitcoin Network makes it impracticable for an actor to gain control of computers representing a majority of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network. During May and June 2014, mining pool GHash.io’s hashing power approached 50 percent of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network. During a brief period in early June 2014, the mining pool may have controlled in excess of one-half of the Bitcoin Network’s processing power. Although no malicious activity or abnormal transaction recording was observed, the incident establishes that it is possible that a substantial mining pool may accumulate close to or more than a majority of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network. As of October 11, 2018, no single pool controlled more than twenty four percent of the total processing power.

If a malicious actor acquired sufficient computational power necessary to control the Bitcoin Network (which amount would be well in excess of fifty percent), it would be able to engage in double-spending, or prevent some or all transactions from being confirmed, and prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid new blocks. The malicious actor or group of actors, however, would not be able to reverse other people’s transactions, change the fixed number of bitcoins generated per new block, or transfer previously existing bitcoins that belong to other users.
 
Cancer Nodes
 
This form of attack involves a malicious actor propagating “cancer nodes” to isolate certain users from the legitimate Bitcoin Network. A target user functionally surrounded by cancer nodes would be put on a separate “network,” allowing the malicious actor to relay only blocks created by the separate network and thus opening the target user to double-spending attacks. By using cancer nodes, a malicious actor also can disconnect the target user from the bitcoin economy entirely by refusing to relay any blocks or transactions. Bitcoin software programs make these attacks more difficult by limiting the number of outbound connections through which users are connected to the Bitcoin Network.
Manipulating Blockchain Formation
 
A malicious actor may attempt to double-spend bitcoins by manipulating the formation of the Blockchain rather than through control of the Bitcoin Network. In this type of attack, a miner creates a valid new block containing a double-spend transaction and schedules the release of such attack block so that it is added to the Blockchain before a target user’s legitimate transaction can be included in a block. Variations of this form of attack include the “Finney attack,” “race attack,” and “vector76 attack.” All double-spend attacks require that the miner sequence and execute the steps of its attack with sufficient speed and accuracy. Users and merchants can dramatically reduce the risk of a double-spend attack by waiting for multiple confirmations from the Bitcoin Network before settling a transaction. The Bitcoin Network still may be used to execute instantaneous, low-value transactions without confirmation to the extent the recipient of bitcoins determines that a malicious miner would be unwilling to carry out a double-spend attack for low-value transactions because the reward from mining would be higher than the small profit gained from double-spending. Users and merchants can take additional precautions by adjusting their Bitcoin Network software programs to connect only to other well-connected nodes and to disable incoming connections. These precautions reduce the risk of double-spend attacks involving manipulation of a target’s connectivity to the Bitcoin Network (as is the case with vector76 and race attacks).
 
Historical Chart of the Price of Bitcoins, 2018-2019
 
The price of bitcoins is volatile and fluctuations are expected. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world. Since our Transaction Verification Services business records revenue based on the price of earned bitcoins and we may retain such bitcoins as an asset or as payment for future expenses, the relative value of such revenues may fluctuate, as will the value of any bitcoins we retain. The following chart illustrates the fluctuating value of the US Dollar exchange rate for bitcoins for the one-year period ending January 29, 2019, as reported by blockchain.com:

Uses of Bitcoins
 
Global Bitcoin Market
 
Global trade in bitcoins consists of individual end-user-to-end-user transactions, together with facilitated exchange-based bitcoin trading. A limited market currently exists for bitcoin-based derivatives. There is currently no reliable data on the total number or demographic composition of users or miners on the Bitcoin Network.
Goods and Services
 
Bitcoins also can be used to purchase goods and services, either online or at physical locations, although reliable data is not readily available about the retail and commercial market penetration of the Bitcoin Network. In addition to our Company in January 2014, US national online retailers Overstock.com and TigerDirect began accepting bitcoin payments. Over the course of 2014, computer hardware and software company Microsoft began accepting bitcoins as online payment for certain digital content, online retailer NewEgg began accepting bitcoins, and computer hardware company Dell began accepting bitcoins. There are thousands of additional online merchants that accept bitcoins, and the variety of goods and services for which bitcoins can be exchanged is increasing. Currently, local, regional and national businesses, including Time Inc., Wikimedia, WordPress, Expedia and Foodler, accept bitcoin. Bitcoin service providers such as BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin and online gift card retailer Gyft provide other means to spend bitcoin for goods and services at additional retailers. There are also many real-world locations that accept bitcoin throughout the world. In 2014, payments giant PayPal announced a partnership with BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin to expand their bitcoin-related services to PayPal’s merchant customers, thereby significantly expanding the reach of bitcoin-accepting merchants. To date, the rate of consumer adoption and use of bitcoin in paying merchants has trailed the broad expansion of retail and commercial acceptance of bitcoin. Nevertheless, there will likely be a strong correlation between continued expansion of the Bitcoin Network and its retail and commercial market penetration.
Anonymity and Illicit Use
 
The Bitcoin Network was not designed to ensure the anonymity of users, despite a common misperception to the contrary. All bitcoin transactions are logged on the Blockchain and any individual or government can trace the flow of bitcoins from one address to another. Off-Blockchain transactions occurring off the Bitcoin Network are not recorded and do not represent actual bitcoin transactions or the transfer of bitcoins from one digital wallet address to another, though information regarding participants in an Off-Blockchain transaction may be recorded by the parties facilitating such Off-Blockchain transactions. Digital wallet addresses are randomized sequences of 27-34 alphanumeric characters that, standing alone, do not provide sufficient information to identify users; however, various methods may be used to connect an address to a particular user’s identity, including, among other things, simple Internet searching, electronic surveillance and statistical network analysis and data mining. Anonymity is also reduced to the extent that certain Bitcoin Exchanges and other service providers collect users’ personal information, because such Bitcoin Exchanges and service providers may be required to produce users’ information in order to comply with legal requirements. In many cases, a user’s own activity on the Bitcoin Network or on Internet forums may reveal information about the user’s identity.
 
Users may take certain precautions to enhance the likelihood that they and their transactions will remain anonymous. For instance, a user may send its bitcoins to different addresses multiple times to make tracking the bitcoins through the Blockchain more difficult or, more simply, engage a so-called “mixing” or “tumbling” service to switch its bitcoins with those of other users. However, these precautions do not guarantee anonymity and are illegal to the extent that they constitute money laundering or otherwise violate the law.
 
As with any other asset or medium of exchange, bitcoins can be used to purchase illegal goods or fund illicit activities. For example, Silk Road, an anonymous online marketplace that sold illegal substances prior to its seizure and the arrest of its founder and operator in October 2013, accepted only bitcoins. The use of bitcoins for illicit purposes, however, is not promoted by the Bitcoin Network or the user community as a whole. Furthermore, we do not believe our ecommerce platform, which we no longer support or are developing, has exposure to such uses because the products sold in our marketplace were curated by our management and the sellers of those products are big box retailers with credible products and retail operations.
 
Alternative Digital Assets
 
Bitcoins are not the only type of Digital Assets founded on math-based algorithms and cryptographic security, although it was considered the most prominent as of January 24, 2019. Over 2,100 other Digital Assets, (commonly referred to as “altcoins”, “tokens”, “protocol tokens”, or “Digital Assets”), have been developed since the Bitcoin Network’s inception, including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, and Monero. The Bitcoin Network, however, possesses the “first-to-market” advantage and thus far has captured the majority of the industry’s market share and is secured by a mining network with significantly more processing power than that of any other Digital Asset. The Company is examining and will continue to examine these other Digital Assets including Digital Securities and acquire them, subject to financing, existing market conditions and regulatory compliance.

Government Oversight
 
The Bitcoin Network is a recent technological innovation and the regulatory schemes to which bitcoin and the Bitcoin Network may be subject have not been fully explored or developed. Recent actions taken by the SEC in its DAO Report that certain Digital Assets may be securities and actions taken by the CFTC including its July 24, 2017 order approving the first derivative clearing organization for digital currency swaps reflects that we may face increased government regulation and oversight. As stated earlier in this report, the SEC’s July 25, 2017 DAO Report, its Chairman’s recent remarks and concerns about the “Wild West” nature of the Digital Assets market and reports that its staff is issuing subpoenas will adversely affect the Company’s future acquisition of Digital Assets by limiting the amount of Digital Securities it may acquire and creating increased compliance and legal costs. In the future before we acquire Digital Assets, we may be required to examine how they were originally offered to determine if they were offered as an investment contract or security. Because of legal uncertainties, careful examination of the results of our compliance review will be required by experienced securities counsel. Because we must stay under the Investment Company’s 40% provisions, we will limit the amount of Digital Securities we acquire and establish procedures designed to protect us from rapid fluctuations in value of our Digital Assets portfolio. If our compliance procedures and legal reviews prove to be incorrect, we may incur the likelihood of prohibitive SEC penalties and/or private lawsuit defense costs and adverse rulings.
 
Following the issuance of the DAO Report, promoters sought to evade it by callings coins “utility tokens” even where the developer retained material future services that affected the profitability and future value of the coins. The SEC quickly stopped one such initial coin offering, which clearly was intended to send a message.
 
The Company does not currently own any virtual currencies, however, subject to additional funding intents to acquire virtual currencies. The Company has previously owned bitcoin, ether and other virtual currencies and may acquire them in the future. In order to avoid being an inadvertent investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, we actively focus on insuring that our ownership of assets that are not securities will always exceed 60% of our total assets excluding cash. See “Risk Factors” at page 16 and “Business at page 3. The ownership of Digital Assets including digital securities may change based on the definition of a security under the Securities Act and applicable court decisions. The key definition is the term “investment contract” and what is an investment contract. In 1946 the U.S. Supreme Court held that an investment in an orange grove operated and controlled by a third party was an investment contract and therefore a security subject to various provisions of the federal securities laws.
 
In the future if we acquire Digital Assets that may be a security we will analyze whether our ownership of the Digital Assets are securities under the investment contract analysis from the leading case and the lower court cases which have followed it. The test for determining if an asset is an investment contract based upon whether there was: (i) an investment of money, (ii) in a common enterprise, (iii) with the expectation of profits, (iv) primarily through the efforts of others.
 
Bitcoin
 
The Company previously owned Bitcoin but does not currently own Bitcoin but may own Bitcoin in the future and has therefor included the following analysis of Bitcoin.
 
Regardless of how one obtains bitcoin it requires an investment of money (whether it be U.S. dollars, other currency, or virtual currency) or mining. When a holder acquires bitcoin, the holder pays for the bitcoin with some form of currency, thus bitcoin satisfies this prong of the test.
 
Courts have focused on three distinct types of common enterprise: (i) horizontal commonality; (ii) broad vertical commonality; and (iii) strict vertical commonality. The horizontal commonality test requires a pooling of investors and profit sharing.
 
The holders of bitcoin do not pool their assets in a common entity or make payments to one common enterprise. Bitcoin is, by its design, decentralized and has no common entity controlling it. Mining, buying, and selling of bitcoin are all decentralized exchanges which do not feature the holders sharing in risks. Similarly, sellers of bitcoin do not share profits or risks with the purchasers and each purchaser keeps his or her own profits. Bitcoin holders who see their holdings as an investment are viewing bitcoin as an appreciating asset not as a common enterprise. Thus, bitcoin does not satisfy the test for horizontal commonality.
 
With broad vertical commonality, the key is an investors’ dependence on the efforts and expertise of the promoter or in the case of virtual currencies based on blockchain, the developer. There is no central promoter or common seller for bitcoin. Further, an individual seller of bitcoin would not constitute a promoter. A court has concluded that when the seller is no longer involved with the business there is no common enterprise. The lack of continuing management by the promoter or developer is similar to the land development cases where the courts have concluded that initial development services do not lead to the conclusion that the sale of a real estate parcel is a security. Thus, bitcoin does not satisfy the test for broad vertical commonality.
 
Strict vertical commonality differs from broad vertical commonality by requiring that the fortunes of the investors be tied to the efforts of the promoter or third parties; pooling is not an element. Because sellers of bitcoin do not provide further services or share in future price increases, bitcoin does not satisfy the test for strict vertical commonality.


The speculative fever surrounding bitcoin means that buyers of it often expect profits arising from value of the appreciation of bitcoin just as has historically happened with gold and silver. While some holders may acquire bitcoin exclusively for the purpose of transacting sales (similar to a currency), many holders acquire bitcoin in order to sell it at a later date when the value has appreciated or depreciated.

The Supreme Court’s use of “solely” has been interpreted by an appellate court to mean “the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.” However, the effort to create profit need not come exclusively from the efforts of others so long as the efforts of others are significant and primary. Bitcoin’s expectation of profits arise not from any efforts of others but from mere hoped for appreciation of value. This is similar to commodities such as gold or diamonds. As such, bitcoin does not satisfy this prong of the Supreme Court’s test.
 
As a result of failing to meet the prongs of the test for common enterprise and the efforts of others, we believe that bitcoin does not constitute an investment contract and is not a security.
 
Ether
 
The Company previously owned Ether but does not currently own Ether but may own Ether in the future and has therefor included the following analysis of Ether.
 
As mentioned in the SEC’s DAO Report, ether is a virtual currency originally created by the Ethereum Foundation that permits the development by third parties of digitalized contracts on a decentralized blockchain platform called the Ethereum Blockchain. The DAO Report refers to ether as a “virtual currency” which was used to purchase DAO tokens. The DAO Report could have but did not concluded that ether is or may be a security. In the DAO Report the Commission concluded that the DAO tokens under discussion were securities. As a virtual currency like bitcoin, the Company does not believe that ether is a security. Our counsel has advised us that while it is clear that bitcoin is not a security and more likely than not that ether is not a security, there is a risk that the SEC or a court may conclude otherwise. This is a factor that we must consider in evaluating whether we have become or may become an investment company since it will never be practical for us to register under the 1940 Act. However, due to cost considerations our counsel has not completed a full analysis as to whether or not ether is a security. Its view is that when ether was initially developed it may have been an investment contract which is one part of the statutory definition of a security. Nonetheless, while not settled, our counsel believes that while not free from doubt, it appears that ether presently is a virtual currency and not an investment contract or security. Since bitcoin constitutes approximately 70% of our eligible assets and we monitor this valuation on a daily basis, we do not believe it is in our shareholders’ interests or necessary for the protection of investors to get a more definitive opinion on ether.
 
Until February 2014, the only U.S. federal regulator to release official guidance on bitcoin and the Bitcoin Network was FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury responsible for the federal regulation of currency market participants. On March 18th, 2013, FinCEN issued interpretive guidance relating to the application of the Bank Secrecy Act to distributing, exchanging and transmitting “virtual currencies.” More specifically, it determined that a Bitcoin user will not be considered a money service business (“MSB”) or be required to register, report and perform recordkeeping; however, an administrator or exchanger of bitcoin must be a registered money services business under FinCEN’s money transmitter regulations. As a result, Bitcoin Exchanges that deal with U.S. residents or otherwise fall under U.S. jurisdiction are required to obtain licenses and comply with FinCEN regulations. FinCEN released additional guidance on January 30, 2014, April 29, 2014, October 27, 2014 and August 14, 2015, clarifying that most miners, software developers, hardware manufacturers, escrow service providers and investors in bitcoin would not be required to register with FinCEN on the basis of such activity alone, but that Bitcoin Exchanges, payment processors and convertible Digital Asset administrators would likely be required to register with FinCEN on the basis of the activities described in the October 2014 and August 2015 letters.
 
Prior to concluding that digital assets may be securities, the SEC has taken various actions against persons or entities misusing bitcoin in connection with fraudulent schemes (i.e., Ponzi schemes), inaccurate and inadequate publicly disseminated information, and the offering of unregistered securities. Clarity regarding the treatment of bitcoin was obtained on September 17, 2015, when the CFTC instituted and settled the Coinflip case. The Coinflip order found that the respondents (i) conducted activity related to commodity options transactions without complying with the provisions of the CEA and CFTC regulations, and (ii) operated a facility for the trading of swaps without registering the facility as a SEF or DCM. The Coinflip order was significant as it is the first time the CFTC determined that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities under the CEA. Based on this determination, the CFTC applied CEA provisions and CFTC regulations that apply to transactions in commodity options and swaps to the conduct of the bitcoin derivatives trading platform. Also of significance, is that the CFTC appears to have taken the position that bitcoin is not encompassed by the definition of currency under the CEA and CFTC regulations. The CFTC defined bitcoin and other “virtual currencies” as “a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are distinct from ‘real’ currencies, which are the coin and paper money of the United States or another country that are designated as legal tender, circulate, and are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance.”
 
The CFTC affirmed its approach to the regulation of bitcoin and bitcoin-related enterprises on June 2, 2016, when the CFTC settled charges against Bitfinex, a Bitcoin Exchange based in Hong Kong. In its Order, the CFTC found that Bitfinex engaged in “illegal, off-exchange commodity transactions and failed to register as a futures commission merchant” when it facilitated borrowing transactions among its users to permit the trading of bitcoin on a “leveraged, margined or financed basis” without first registering with the CFTC. In 2017 the CFTC stated that it would consider bitcoin and other virtual currencies as commodities or derivatives depending on the facts of the offering. The CME Group announced that it will permit trading of bitcoin futures on its exchanges as early as December 2017.

On March 25, 2014, the IRS released guidance on the treatment of virtual convertible currencies, such as bitcoin, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The guidance, the first issued by a U.S. government agency regarding the asset classification of bitcoin, classified bitcoin as “property” that it is not currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The guidance clarified that bitcoin could be held as capital assets and that holders of bitcoin were required to track gains and losses relating to their cost basis at acquisition and their amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the bitcoin. The IRS also clarified that bitcoin received as payment (e.g., as wages or, in the case of a miner, as a reward for solving a block) is included in the recipient’s taxable income based on the fair market value of bitcoin when received. The IRS may revisit its treatment of Digital Assets, including seeking enforcement of existing guidance or issuing new guidance, in response to recommendations in a September 2016 report by the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The asset classification of bitcoin by the IRS is not controlling on other government agencies for purposes other than those relating to U.S. federal income tax.
 
On June 26, 2014, the U.S. Government Accountability Office publicly released a report to the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs that summarized regulatory, law enforcement and consumer protection assessments regarding the Bitcoin economy and Bitcoin in general. The report recommended that the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau participate in inter-agency working groups on Bitcoin to assess how the agency might address Bitcoin-related consumer protection issues. The report echoed, in part, a May 7, 2014 investor alert published by the SEC that highlighted fraud and other concerns relating to certain investment opportunities denominated in bitcoin and fraudulent and unregistered investment schemes targeted at participants in online Bitcoin forums. In the fall of 2014, the SEC is reported to have initiated an inquiry into the sale of unregistered securities denominated in bitcoin or altcoins, and into the sale of “crypto-equity” (i.e., tokens for use on altcoin programming platforms), although the Company has not verified the scope or veracity of such reports due to the confidentiality of such inquiries.
 
As of April 2016, the U.S. Congress, U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, the CFTC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”), and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors had initiated formal inquiries into or held hearings on Digital Assets, including bitcoin, and possible regulation thereof. Members of the private sector and representatives of the Department of Justice, Secret Service and FinCEN (among other government agencies) had participated in such inquiries and hearings.
 
U.S. state regulators, including the California Department of Financial Institutions, NYSDFS, Virginia Corporation Commission, Idaho Department of Financial Services and Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, have similarly released interpretations or mandates that Bitcoin Exchanges and similar Bitcoin service providers register on a state-level as MTs or MSB. In July 20-17, Delaware amended its General Corporation Law to provide for the creation maintenance of certain required records by blockchain technology and permit its use for electronic transmission of stockholder communications. In June 2014, the State of California adopted legislation that would formally repeal laws that could be interpreted as making illegal the use of bitcoin or other Digital Assets as a means of payment. In February 2015, a bill was introduced in the California State Assembly to establish a licensing regime for businesses engaging in virtual currencies. In September 2015, the bill was ordered to become an inactive file and as of the date of this report there hasn’t been further consideration by the California State Assembly. As of August 2016, the bill was withdrawn from consideration for vote for the remainder of the year.
 
In July 2014, the NYSDFS proposed the first US regulatory framework for licensing participants in “virtual currency business activity.” The proposed regulations, known as the “BitLicense,” are intended to focus on consumer protection and, after the closure of an initial comment period that yielded 3,746 formal public comments and a reproposal, the NYSDFS issued its final “BitLicense” regulatory framework in June 2015. The “BitLicense” regulates the conduct of businesses that are involved in “virtual currencies” in New York or with New York customers and prohibits any person or entity involved in such activity to conduct activities without a license. The “BitLicense” requires, among other things, that licensees are adequately capitalized, maintain detailed books and records, adopt anti-money laundering policies, ensure they have robust cyber security policies and incorporate a variety of other compliance policies. As of January 2017, the NYSDFS has granted a “BitLicense” to three (3) market participants.
 
On December 16, 2014, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors released for public comment a proposed model regulatory framework for state regulation of participants in “virtual currency activities.” Although similar in some regards, the proposed model framework does not track completely the BitLicense regulations in New York. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors proposed framework is a non-binding model and would have to be independently adopted, in sum or in part, by state legislatures or regulators on a case-by-case basis. In numerous other states, including Connecticut, North Carolina, New Hampshire and New Jersey, legislation is being proposed or has been introduced regarding the treatment of bitcoin and other Digital Assets.
 
In addition, various foreign jurisdictions may adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect Bitcoin. In October 2012, the European Central Bank issued a report on “virtual currency” schemes indicating that Bitcoin may become the subject of regulatory interest in the European Union. In August 2013, the German Ministry of Finance released an interpretation that labeled bitcoin to be a form of private money or a unit of account that is not recognized as a full currency, but is subject to German tax laws. A ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union on October 22, 2015 found that a bitcoin exchange’s trading of bitcoin for conventional currency (such as Euros or Swedish Krona) and vice versa was subject to value added tax (“VAT”) rules because it constituted the supply of services for consideration. However, the court also found that bitcoin could qualify for an exception reserved for transactions related to currency, bank notes, and other legal tender, and thus the bitcoin trading could be exempted from VAT. The ruling shows that bitcoin tax treatment in the European Union has moved more closely in-line with that of conventional currency. Foreign government bodies have also initiated public inquiries similar to those taken by US government bodies, including public hearings on Digital Assets, including bitcoin, held by both the French and Canadian Senates. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice determined that exchanging transactions in Digital Assets are exempt from value-added taxes in the same manner as traditional currencies. In July 2016, the European Commission released a draft directive that proposed applying counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering regulations to virtual currencies, and in September 2016, the European Banking authority advised the European Commission to institute new regulation specific to virtual currencies, with amendments to existing regulation as a stopgap measure.

The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2017 that China has decided to ban Digital Asset Exchanges which has had the immediate effect of reducing the price of bitcoin. Earlier on December 5, 2013, the People’s Bank of China and five Chinese ministries released a notice that restricted Bitcoin activity among its financial and payment institutions while classifying bitcoin as a “virtual commodity” that was legal to own and speculate in. News reports from China indicated that many banking institutions and third-party payment processors in China had received private guidance leading them to close Bitcoin Exchange bank accounts that held Chinese Yuan on behalf of exchange customers. During the second half of 2014, Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges again began to accept deposits of Chinese Yuan through the use of third-party payment providers, and trading activity returned to higher levels. In January 2016, the People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank, disclosed that it has been studying a state-backed electronic monetary system and potentially had plans for its own state-backed electronic money. In January 2017, the People’s Bank of China announced that it had found several violations, including margin financing and a failure to impose anti-money laundering controls, after on-site inspections of two China-based Bitcoin Exchanges. In response to the Chinese regulator’s oversight, the three largest China-based Bitcoin Exchanges, OKCoin, Huobi, and BTC China, started charging trading commission fees to suppress speculative trading and prevent price swings which resulted in a significant drop in volume on these exchanges. On September 4, 2017, reports were published that China may begin prohibiting the practice of using cryptocurrency for capital fundraising. Additional reports have surfaced that China is considering regulating Bitcoin Exchanges by enacting a licensing regime wherein Bitcoin Exchanges may legally operate.
 
In Russia, state agencies and prosecutors have released guidance or statements that have hampered the growth of bitcoin. In January 2014, anonymous electronic transfers were restricted to de minimis sums; although bitcoin transactions are not truly anonymous, this measure has been taken to apply to the Bitcoin Network. Additionally, a central bank statement warned of the association of bitcoin and money laundering and terrorist activity. In early February, a prosecutor implied that the use of bitcoin and bitcoin themselves were not legal tender and were illegal, although whether this amounted to a ban on bitcoin has been questioned. In April 2016, it was reported that the Russian Finance Ministry was considering proposing regulations that would prohibit the issuance of all Digital Assets or their use in exchange for goods or services in Russia. However, in July 2016, in a significant change in tone, the Russian Ministry of Finance indicated it supports a proposed law that bans bitcoin domestically but allows for its use as a foreign currency. In October 2017, Russia issued several releases indicating they may begin regulating bitcoin and licensing miners and entities engaging in initial coin offerings.
 
After the United States, China and Russia were among the next tier of large bitcoin-using jurisdictions as of late 2013. The impact of the restrictions has been seen in a decline of Chinese investment activity in bitcoin and a reduction in the number of bitcoin nodes operating in Russia had continued into late 2014, despite a pickup in trading volume on Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges. Less active bitcoin jurisdictions in Iceland (conversion between bitcoin and krona prohibited), Vietnam (financial services firms prohibited from interacting with Bitcoin) and Bolivia (use of bitcoin prohibited by the Central Bank of Bolivia) have more severely restricted the use of bitcoin with little impact on the global growth of bitcoin. Similarly, the reported ban on decentralized Digital Assets in Ecuador (made in advance of plans to introduce a government backed electronic cash system) have had no visible impact on the Bitcoin Network due to limited use of bitcoin in Ecuador.
 
While jurisdictions such as Germany and China have taken a preliminary regulatory stance on bitcoin, some countries have declined to apply regulation to bitcoin when afforded the opportunity. In June 2014, the Swiss government elected not to regulate bitcoin use and issued guidance on the further development and future application of laws to bitcoin-related activity in Switzerland. In 2017 Switzerland gave a swiss bank approval to manage assets based on bitcoin and other Digital Assets. Among others, Australia, Finland and the Netherlands have joined Canada and Germany among the foreign countries releasing formal or informal tax guidance regarding bitcoin income or operations. On August 24, 2017, Canada issued guidance stating the sale of cryptocurrency may constitute the sale of investment contract in accordance with Canadian law for determining if an investment constitutes a security.
 
Due in part to its international nature and the nascent stage of regulation, along with the limited experience with bitcoin of, and language barriers between, international journalists, information regarding the regulation of bitcoin in various jurisdictions may be incomplete, inaccurate or unreliable. For example, news of the People’s Bank of China notice release on December 5, 2013 was followed by days of confusion relating to difficulty in interpreting and analyzing the content of the release. In another instance, on July 29, 2013, a bitcoin service business in Thailand announced that, in a meeting with the Bank of Thailand, regulators from the Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department had functionally banned bitcoin activity in the country, leading to widespread reporting of a blanket ban. Later reporting, however, questioned whether the Bank of Thailand regulators had the authority, or ever expressed the intention, to ban all bitcoin use in Thailand. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2014, the Bank of Thailand issued a warning to its citizens regarding the risks of bitcoin and stated that it is not a currency. Despite these announcements, bitcoin exchanges continue to operate in Thailand converting bitcoin to and from Thai baht.
 
In April 2015, the Japanese Cabinet approved proposed legal changes that would reportedly treat bitcoin and other Digital Assets as included in the definition of currency. These regulations would, among other things, require market participants, including exchanges, to meet certain compliance requirements and be subject to oversight by the Financial Services Agency, a Japanese regulator. These changes were approved by the Japanese Diet in May 2016 and became effective in April 2017. In September 2017, Japan began regulating Bitcoin Exchanges and registered several such exchanges to operate within Japan.

In September 2017, the Financial Services Commission in South Korea released a statement that initial coin offerings would be prohibited as a fundraising tool. In January 2018, the South Korean Justice Minister issued remarks about banning bitcoin and other Digital Assets, although the President’s office clarified that no final decision has been made.
 
In June 2017, India’s government ruled in favor of regulating bitcoin and India’s ministry of Finance is currently developing rules for such regulation.
 
In February 2018, the Ontario Securities Commission recently approved a Blockchain exchange-traded fund for launch on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
 
Australia has previously introduced legislation to regulate Bitcoin Exchanges and increase anti-money laundering policies.
 
As both the regulatory landscape develops and journalistic familiarity with bitcoin increases, mainstream media’s understanding of Digital Assets and the regulation thereof may improve. Regulation of Digital Assets varies from country to country as well as within countries. An increase in the regulation of Digital Assets may affect our proposed business by increasing compliance costs or prohibiting certain or all of our proposed activities.
 
COMPETITION
 
Blockchain Technology and Digital Assets Initiatives
 
Subject to raising additional capital, the Company’s Digital Asset initiatives will compete with other industry participants that focus on investing in and securing the Blockchains of bitcoin and other Digital Assets. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Company’s control, may make it more attractive to invest in other entities, or to invest in bitcoin or Digital Assets directly. Companies have raised substantial capital this year seeking to enter the Digital Assets business. Our lack of capital is a competitive disadvantage.
 
Transaction Verification Service Business (digital asset mining e.g. bitcoin, Suspended)
 
While our current Transaction Verification Services business is suspended we anticipate that if we resume our operations, which is subject to additional financing, our current and future competition is centered on the following areas:
 

● | Vertically integrated companies such as Bitfury, Bitmain Technologies, Canaan Creative, and BW which design and build ASIC servers and are engaged in transaction verification services through the use of their own ASIC servers; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Companies that are engaged in transaction verification services which may have lower operating costs than our future operations. 

 
Our potential competitors may have greater resources, longer histories, more intellectual property, greater hashing capacity, and lower cost operations. They may secure better terms from ASIC server suppliers, deploy ASIC servers faster than us, and devote more resources to technology infrastructure. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.
 
ASSETS
 
The Company’s sole asset (other than its cash balance) is its human capital specifically Mr. Allen and Mr. Handerhan, who have extensive market knowledge and long-standing business relationships within the industry. Our success depends solely on their continued service. See “Risk Factors” below.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TRADE SECRETS
 
We have no intellectual property assets or licenses and rely upon the experience of our two executive officers in the Digital Assets business as it has evolved.

GROWTH STRATEGY
 
Transaction Verification Services Growth Strategy
 
We believe that with additional funding we may be able to resume our transaction verification services business (Digital Asset mining e.g. bitcoin) and believe this may provide revenue growth. However, given the current network difficulties and price levels to mine both ethereum and bitcoin we do not believe mining offers a positive return on investment at present. We plan to monitor the blockchain networks and subject to additional funding re-enter the mining business when we believe a positive return on investment is achievable. If we are successful in resuming our transaction verification services business, we anticipate utilizing outsourced data centers and may diversify operations by securing other blockchains in addition to bitcoins blockchain.
EMPLOYEES
 
We currently have two employees.
