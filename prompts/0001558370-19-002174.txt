 Business. The Company’s principal business consists of attracting deposits and investing those deposits in loans/leases and securities. The deposits of the subsidiary banks are insured to the maximum amount allowable by the FDIC. The Company’s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on its loans/leases and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The Company’s operating results are affected by economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities, as described more fully in this Form 10‑K. Its operating results also can be affected by trust fees, investment advisory and management fees, deposit service charge fees, gains on the sale of residential real estate and government guaranteed loans, earnings from BOLI and other noninterest income. Operating expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, professional and data processing fees, advertising and marketing expenses, bank service charges, FDIC and other insurance, loan/lease expenses and other administrative expenses.

 The Company and its subsidiaries collectively employed 755 and 641 FTEs at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The majority of the increase in FTEs during 2018 was the result of the additions of  SFC Bank and the Bates Companies and new positions created to accommodate the increased scale of our operations.
 The Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator of the Company, QCBT, CRBT, CSB, SFC Bank and RB&T.  QCBT, CRBT and CSB are also regulated by the Iowa Superintendent of Banking, SFC Bank is regulated by the Missouri Division of Finance and RB&T is regulated by the IDFPR. The FDIC, as administrator of the DIF, also has regulatory authority over the subsidiary banks. See Appendix A for more information on the federal and state statutes and regulations that are applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries.
 Lending/Leasing. The Company and its subsidiaries provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending/leasing and investment services to corporations, partnerships, individuals, and government agencies. The subsidiary banks actively market their services to qualified lending and deposit clients. Officers actively solicit the business of new clients entering their market areas as well as long-standing members of the local business community. The Company has an established lending/leasing policy which includes a number of underwriting factors to be considered in making a loan/lease, including, but not limited to, location, loan-to-value ratio, cash flow, collateral and the credit history of the borrower.
 In accordance with Iowa regulation, the legal lending limit to one borrower for QCBT, CRBT and CSB, calculated as 15% of aggregate capital, was $24.3 million, $25.2 million, and $12.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with Missouri regulation, the legal lending limit to one borrower for SFC Bank, calculated as 15% of aggregate capital, totaled $8.6 million as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with Illinois regulation, the legal lending limit to one borrower for RB&T, calculated as 25% of aggregate capital, totaled $12.6 million as of December 31, 2018.  
 The Company recognizes the need to prevent excessive concentrations of credit exposure to any one borrower or group of related borrowers. As such, the Company has established an in-house lending limit, which is lower than each subsidiary bank’s legal lending limit, in an effort to manage individual borrower exposure levels.
 The in-house lending limit is the maximum amount of credit each subsidiary bank will extend to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities. As of January 1, 2017, the Company implemented a tiered approach, based on the risk rating of the borrower. Under the most recent in-house limit, total credit exposure to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities will not exceed the following, subject to certain exceptions:

 | High Quality | | Medium Quality | | Low Quality 
 | (Risk Ratings 1-3) | | (Risk Rating 4) | | (Risk Ratings 5-8)
 | (dollars in thousands)
QCBT | $ | 14,000 | | $ | 11,750 | $ | 8,000 
CRBT | $ | 13,000 | | $ | 11,000 | $ | 7,500 
CSB | $ | 9,500 | | $ | 8,000 | $ | 5,500 
SFC Bank | $ | 9,000 | | $ | 7,500 | $ | 5,000 
RB&T | $ | 4,500 | | $ | 3,750 | $ | 2,500 
QCRH Consolidated | $ | 25,000 | | $ | 19,000 | $ | 12,500

      The QCRH Consolidated amount represents the maximum amount of credit that all affiliated banks, when combined, will extend to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities, subject to certain exceptions.
 In addition, m2’s in-house lending limit is $1.0 million to a single leasing entity or group of related entities, subject to certain exceptions.
 As part of the loan monitoring activity at the five subsidiary banks, credit administration personnel interact closely with senior bank management. For example, the internal loan committee of each subsidiary bank meets weekly. The Company has a separate in-house loan review function to analyze credits of the subsidiary banks.   To complement the in-house loan review, an independent third-party performs external loan reviews. Historically, management has attempted to identify problem loans at an early stage and to aggressively seek a resolution of those situations.
 The Company recognizes that a diversified loan/lease portfolio contributes to reducing risk in the overall loan/lease portfolio. The specific loan/lease portfolio mix is subject to change based on loan/lease demand, the business environment

and various economic factors. The Company actively monitors concentrations within the loan/lease portfolio to ensure appropriate diversification and concentration risk is maintained.
 Specifically, each subsidiary bank’s total loans as a percentage of average assets may not exceed 85%. In addition, following are established policy limits and the actual allocations for the subsidiary banks as of December 31, 2018 for the loan portfolio organized by loan type, reflected as a percentage of the subsidiary bank’s gross loans:

      Proper pricing of loans is necessary to provide adequate return to the Company’s stockholders. Loan pricing, as established by the subsidiary banks’ internal loan committees, includes consideration for the cost of funds, loan maturity and risk, origination and maintenance costs, appropriate stockholder return, competitive factors, and the economic environment. The portfolio contains a mix of loans with fixed and floating interest rates. Management attempts to maximize the use of interest rate floors on its variable rate loan portfolio. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more discussion on the Company’s management of interest rate risk.
 C&I Lending
 As noted above, the subsidiary banks are active C&I lenders. The current areas of emphasis include loans to small and mid-sized businesses with a wide range of operations such as wholesalers, manufacturers, building contractors, business services companies, other banks, and retailers. The banks provide a wide range of business loans, including lines of credit for working capital and operational purposes, and term loans for the acquisition of facilities, equipment and other purposes. Since 2010, the subsidiary banks have been active in participating in lending programs offered by the SBA and USDA. Under these programs, the government entities will generally provide a guarantee of repayment ranging from 50% to 85% of the principal amount of the qualifying loan.

 Loan approval is generally based on the following factors:

· | Ability and stability of current management of the borrower;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stable earnings with positive financial trends;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | Sufficient cash flow to support debt repayment;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | Earnings projections based on reasonable assumptions;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Financial strength of the industry and business; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | Value and marketability of collateral.
--+---------------------------------------

  For C&I loans, the Company assigns internal risk ratings which are largely dependent upon the aforementioned approval factors. The risk rating is reviewed annually or on an as needed basis depending on the specific circumstances of the loan. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including the internal risk rating scale.
 As part of the underwriting process, management reviews current borrower financial statements. When appropriate, certain C&I loans may contain covenants requiring maintenance of financial performance ratios such as, but not limited to:

· | Minimum debt service coverage ratio;
--+-------------------------------------


· | Minimum current ratio;
--+-----------------------


· | Maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio; and/or
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Minimum tangible net worth.
--+----------------------------

  Establishment of these financial performance ratios depends on a number of factors, including risk rating and the specific industry.
 Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate. The Company’s lending policy specifies approved collateral types and corresponding maximum advance percentages. The value of collateral pledged on loans must exceed the loan amount by a margin sufficient to absorb potential erosion of its value in the event of foreclosure and cover the loan amount plus costs incurred to convert it to cash. Approved non-real estate collateral types and corresponding maximum advance percentages for each are listed below.

Approved Collateral Type | Maximum Advance % 
Financial Instruments | 
U.S. Government Securities | 90% of market value 
Securities of Federal Agencies | 90% of market value 
Municipal Bonds rated by Moody’s As “A” or better | 80% of market value 
Listed Stocks | 75% of market value 
Mutual Funds | 75% of market value 
Cash Value Life Insurance | 95%, less policy loans 
Savings/Time Deposits (Bank) | 100% of current value 
Penny Stocks | 0% 
General Business | 
Accounts Receivable | 80% of eligible accounts 
Inventory | 50% of value 
Crop and Grain Inventories | 80% of current market value 
Livestock | 80% of purchase price, or current market value; or higher if cross-collateralized with other assets
Fixed Assets (Existing) | 50% of net book value, or 75% of orderly liquidation appraised value 
Fixed Assets (New) | 80% of cost, or higher if cross-collateralized with other assets 
Leasehold Improvements | 0% 

      Generally, if the above collateral is part of a cross-collateralization with other approved assets, then the maximum advance percentage may be higher.
 The Company’s lending policy specifies maximum term limits for C&I loans. For term loans, the maximum term is generally seven years. Generally, term loans range from three to five years. For lines of credit, the maximum term is typically 365 days. For low income housing tax credits permanent loans, the maximum term is generally up to 20 years.

 In addition, the subsidiary banks often take personal guarantees or cosigners to help assure repayment. Loans may be made on an unsecured basis if warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower.
 Following is a summary of the five largest industry concentrations within the C&I portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:

 | 2018 | | 2017 
 | Amount | | Amount
 | (dollars in thousands)
Administration of urban planning & rural development | $ | 111,579 | | $ | 83,344
Hotels & motels | | 83,106 | | | 73,200
Bank holding companies | | 75,601 | | | 66,950
Skilled nursing care facilities | | 53,134 | | | 60,989
General medical & surgical hospitals | | 36,895 | | | 35,217

      These loan categories are defined by industry-standard NAICS codes – refer to NAICS.com for category descriptions.
     CRE Lending
 The subsidiary banks also make CRE loans. CRE loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to C&I loans, in addition to those standards and processes specific to real estate loans. Collateral for these loans generally includes the underlying real estate and improvements, and may include additional assets of the borrower. The Company’s lending policy specifies maximum loan-to-value limits based on the category of CRE (commercial real estate loans on improved property, raw land, land development, and commercial construction). These limits are the same limits as, or in some situations, more conservative than, those established by regulatory authorities. Following is a listing of these limits as well as some of the other guidelines included in the Company’s lending policy for the major categories of CRE loans:

 | | Maximum 
CRE Loan Types | Maximum Advance Rate ** | Term 
CRE Loans on Improved Property * | 80% | 7 years 
Raw Land | Lesser of 90% of project cost, or 65% of "as is" appraised value | 12 months
Land Development*** | Lesser of 85% of project cost, or 75% of "as-completed" appraised value | 24 months
Commercial Construction Loans | Lesser of 85% of project cost, or 80% of "as-completed" appraised value | 12 months
Residential Construction Loans to Builders | Lesser of 90% of project cost, or 80% of "as-completed" appraised value | 12 months


 *     Generally, the debt service coverage ratio must be a minimum of 1.25x for non-owner occupied loans and 1.15x for owner-occupied loans. For loans greater than $500 thousand, the subsidiary banks sensitize this ratio for deteriorated economic conditions, major changes in interest rates, and/or significant increases in vacancy rates.
 **  These maximum rates are consistent with, or in some situations, more conservative than, those established by regulatory authorities.
 *** Generally, the maximum term for land development loans is 12 months but there are some situations where the maximum term would be 24 months.
 The Company’s lending policy also includes guidelines for real estate appraisals and evaluations, including minimum appraisal and evaluation standards based on certain transactions. In addition, the subsidiary banks often take personal guarantees to help assure repayment.
 In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied CRE loans versus non-owner occupied CRE loans. Owner-occupied CRE loans are generally considered to have less risk. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 28% and 26%, respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio was owner-occupied.
 In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Company exercises heightened risk management practices when non-owner occupied CRE lending exceeds 300% of total risk-based capital or construction, land development and other land loans exceed 100% of total risk-based capital. Although CSB’s loan portfolio has historically been real estate dominated and its real estate portfolio levels exceed these policy limits, it has established a Credit Risk Committee to routinely monitor its real estate loan portfolio.

  Residential Real Estate Lending
 Generally, the subsidiary banks’ residential real estate loans conform to the underwriting requirements of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to allow the subsidiary banks to resell loans in the secondary market. The subsidiary banks structure most loans that will not conform to those underwriting requirements as adjustable rate mortgages that adjust in one to five years, and then retain these loans in their portfolios. Servicing rights are generally not retained on the loans sold in the secondary market. The Company’s lending policy establishes minimum appraisal and other credit guidelines.
 The following table presents the originations and sales of residential real estate loans for the Company. Included in originations is activity related to the refinancing of previously held in-house mortgages.
