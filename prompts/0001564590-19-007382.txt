 Company Overview
 We are a global provider of ultra-broadband network access solutions and communications platforms deployed by advanced Tier 1, 2 and 3 service providers and enterprise customers.  Our solutions are deployed by over 900 customers in more than 80 countries worldwide. Our ultra-broadband solutions are focused on creating significant value for our customers by delivering innovative solutions that empower global communication advancement by shaping the internet connection experience.  Every connection matters, and the first connection to the internet and cloud services applications matters the most. Our principal focus is centered around enabling our customers to connect everything and everyone to the internet-cloud economy via ultra-broadband connectivity solutions.
 We research, develop, test, sell, manufacture and support platforms in five major areas: broadband access, mobile backhaul, Ethernet switching with Software Defined Networking (“SDN”) capabilities, new enterprise solutions based on Passive Optical LAN (“POL”), and new generation of SDN/ Network Function Virtualization (“NFV”) solutions for unified wired and wireless networks. We have extensive regional development and support centers around the world to support our customer needs.
 Keymile Acquisition 
 On January 3, 2019, ZTI Merger Subsidiary III Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary, acquired all of the outstanding shares of Keymile GmbH, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Germany (“Keymile”), from 
Riverside KM Beteiligung GmbH, also a limited liability company organized under the laws of Germany, pursuant to a share purchase agreement.  We refer to this transaction as the “Keymile Acquisition.” The aggregate cash purchase price paid for all of the shares of Keymile and certain of its subsidiaries was EUR 10,250,000 ($11.8 million)
, which was paid with a combination of cash, a loan from DNI, and a draw under our Wells Fargo Bank (“Wells Fargo”) credit facility (as amended, the “Wells Fargo 
Facility”). Following the closing of the Keymile Acquisition, Keymile became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary. 
 Keymile is a leading solution provider and manufacturer of telecommunication systems for broadband access. We believe the 
Keymile Acquisition complements and strengthens our portfolio of broadband access solutions, which now includes a series of multi-service access platforms, including ultra-fast broadband copper access based on very-high-bit-rate DSL (“VDSL/Vectoring”) & G. Fast technology.
 Broadband Access
 Our broadband access products are at the core of our product strategy and offer a variety of options for carriers and service providers to connect residential and business customers. Our solutions allow carriers and service providers to either use high-speed fiber or leverage their existing deployed copper networks to offer broadband services to customer premises. Once our broadband access products are deployed, the service provider can offer voice, high-definition and ultra-high-definition video, high-speed internet access and business class services to their customers. We develop our broadband access products for all aspects of carrier and service provider access networks: customer premise equipment. Products include digital subscriber line (“DSL”) modems, Ethernet access demarcation devices, Gigabit passive optical network (“GPON”) terminals, 10 Gigabit (“10G”) passive optical network (“GPON/GEPON/XGPON1/XGSPON/NGPON2/10GEPON”) units and, Gigabit and 10G point-to-point Active Ethernet optical network terminals (“ONTs”). We also develop central office products, such as broadband loop carriers for DSL and voice-grade telephone service (“POTS”), high-speed digital subscriber line access multiplexers (“DSLAMs”) with G. Fast and VDSL capabilities, optical line terminals (“OLTs”) for passive optical distribution networks like GPONs, 10G passive optical networks and 10G point-to-point Active Ethernet.

Ethernet Switching
 Our Ethernet switching products provide a high switching performance and manageable solution that bridges the gap from carrier access technologies to the core network. Over the past ten (10) years carriers have migrated access infrastructure to Ethernet from time-division multiplexing and asynchronous transfer mode systems. Our products can also be deployed in data centers, blurring the line between central office and data center. 
Our products support pure Ethernet switching as well as layer 3 IP and multiprotocol label switching (“
MPLS”) and are currently being developed as part of the new programmable SDNs networks.
 Mobile Backhaul
 Our mobile backhaul products provide a robust, manageable and scalable solution for mobile operators that enable them to upgrade their mobile backhaul systems and migrate from 5G networks 
and beyond. We provide our mobile backhaul products to mobile operators or carriers who provide the transport for mobile operators. Our mobile backhaul products may be collocated at the radio access node base station and can aggregate multiple radio access node base stations into 
a single backhaul for delivery of mobile traffic to the radio access node network controller. We provide standard Ethernet/IP or MPLS interfaces and interoperate with other vendors in these networks. In recent years, mobile backhau
l networks have been providing carriers with significant revenue growth, which has led to mobile backhaul becoming one of the most important parts of their networks.
 Enterprise Passive Optical LAN
Our FiberLANTM portfolio of POL products are designed for enterprise, campus, hospitality and entertainment arena usage. Our portfolio includes high-performance, high-bandwidth switches connected to port extenders, which include units with integrated Power over Ethernet (“PoE”) to power a wide range of PoE-enabled access devices. 
 Our environmentally friendly FiberLAN POL solutions are one of the most cost-effective LAN technologies that can be deployed, allowing IT network managers to deploy a future-proof, low-maintenance, manageable solution that requires less space, air conditioning, copper and electricity than other alternatives.
 The FiberLAN™ 2.0  portfolio is focused on a “plug and play” architecture for a new generation of distributed enterprise IT infrastructure that is both highly secure and bandwidth scalable with unified management of wireless and wireline end points/devices from a central network operations center with full visibility and management control of remote sites. Additionally, with SDN upgrades enterprise networks can be software programmed to autonomously monitor, reconfigure, diagnose and authenticate without the need for human intervention.
 Software Defined Networks
 Our SDN/NFV strategy is to develop tools and building blocks that will allow customers to migrate their networks’ full complement of legacy control plane and data plane devices to a centralized intelligent controller that can reconfigure the services of hundreds of network elements in real time for more controlled and efficient provision of services and bandwidth on a web scale basis.  The latest evolution of our hardware-based solution are designed to support SDN/NFV architectures.
 The adoption of SDN/NFV is a slow process in the service provider space, but is viewed as providing a better service for subscribers and a more efficient and cost-effective use of hardware resources for service providers. We will leverage our broadband access, mobile backhaul and Ethernet switching expertise to extract and virtualize many of the traditional legacy control and data plane functions to allow them to be run from the Cloud. 
 Industry Background
 We believe that expansion in our worldwide business is driven by the increased demand of subscribers and cloud service providers for mobile and fixed network access solutions and communications equipment that enable or support access to higher speed bandwidth access to the internet. Furthermore, increased competition between service providers for the subscriber business has resulted in significant investment pressure to upgrade network infrastructure to meet the growing bandwidth needs. Broadband access networks must be multiservice in nature and must have an extensive quality of service guarantees in order to support 5G mobile backhaul, symmetric business services and residential services as well as virtual overlay networks for alternative operators and wholesale access.
 In recent years, the growth of social communications and networking has placed significant demands on legacy access infrastructure, which has been challenging for the industry, even for the newest and most advanced subscribers. Increased subscriber usage of smartphone, video streaming services, PC gaming services and high definition and ultra-high definition televisions has increased the demand for music, pictures, user-generated content (as found on many video-sharing sites) and high definition video, which have all become a growing part of subscribers’ regular exchange of information. Trends such as SaaS, Cloud, IoT, and 5G have also increased the demand for broadband network access. All of these new technologies share a common dependency on high-bandwidth communication networks and sophisticated traffic management tools. As bandwidth demands continue to increase, carriers need to continue to upgrade their network infrastructure to support such demand. The infrastructure upgrade cycle typically has the effect of moving bandwidth bottlenecks from one part of the network to another (such as a carrier’s access network, core network or data centers), depending on the selection of technology and costs.

It is widely acknowledged in the industry that a fiber-optic broadband access network is the preferred network architecture for a broadband fixed network. This network architecture is commonly called Fiber to the Premises (“FTTP”) for business subscribers or Fiber to the Home (“FTTH”) for residential subscribers. With FTTH all services are generally delivered at the premise through smart optical networking units (ONT).  The Fiber to the Node (“FTTN”) architecture is also deployed where the fiber-optic cable terminates at a street cabinet which contains a DSLAMs or Multiple Service Access Node (“MSAN”) that then provides higher speed services to their customers over the last mile legacy copper wireline infrastructure. With the shift away from the legacy copper telephone TDM switches (used in carrier networks from the 1980’s to the early 2000’s): many carriers that continue to provide services over copper wireline networks are decommissioning their legacy telephone switches and moving services over to Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) platforms via an MSAN/Softswitch solution. Our broadband access products and solutions are designed to address all these fiber configurations commonly referred to as (FTTX) by allowing carriers and service providers to either use fiber-optic networks or leverage their existing deployed copper networks to offer broadband services to customer premises.
 With respect to mobile wireless networks, the popularity of mobile smartphones and increasing demand for mobile data has forced mobile network operators to upgrade their mobile access technologies from 3rd generation wireless (“3G”) to 4th generation wireless (“4G” or “LTE”) and to plan for 5th generation wireless technologies (“5G”). These technology upgrades are typically accompanied by network infrastructure upgrades, including upgrades to the carriers’ access networks (referred to as “mobile backhaul”), core networks and data centers. Our mobile backhaul products, which have features for time sensitive networks, provide a robust, manageable and scalable solution for mobile network operators that enable them to upgrade their mobile backhaul systems and migrate to 4G and 5G.
 Another growing industry trend is the desire of carriers and service providers to simplify network operation and reduce costs. Increasingly, we see network operators seeking to reduce the number of active components in their networks and to centralize network data and control in data centers, both of which require network redesigns and upgrades. Our FiberLAN portfolio of POL products, as well as our Ethernet switching products and SDN and NFV tools and building blocks, are designed to address these market trends, with POL emerging as a popular customer choice for network upgrades.

• | Strategic Mergers and Acquisitions. Prior to the Merger, DNS provided communications equipment primarily in the Asia-Pacific region with a particular focus on Korea, Japan and Vietnam, and Legacy Zhone provided communications equipment primarily in the Americas and in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region. The Merger formed DZS, expanding our geographic reach and range of our product offerings to become a global broadband solutions provider. Further, on January 3, 2019, we acquired Keymile to expand our business efforts in the EMEA region by acquiring experienced employees in sales and marketing, support and services, manufacturing, and research and development groups. This also expanded our in-house manufacturing and logistics and procurement capacity. The Keymile Multi-service Access Nodes (MSAN) portfolio complement the DZS existing portfolio by offering leading class point-to-point active FTTx Ethernet and copper based access technology based on VDSL/Vectoring and G. Fast technology as well as VoIP gateway features. In addition, Keymile has a broad base of customers, comprised primarily of Tier 1 and Tier 2 service providers, across 31 countries, which further offers DZS customer and geographic diversification, particularly in Europe. The new DZS regional EMEA headquarters is now located in the Keymile facilities in Hannover, Germany.

We continue our commitment to invest in leading edge technology research and development for new products and innovative solutions that align with our business strategy. Our research and product development expenses were $35.3 million, $36.0 million, and $25.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Intellectual Property
 We seek to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a number of patents and trademarks in the United States of America (“United States”) and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitive products in every jurisdiction or any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
 Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The communications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 Sales and Marketing
 
We have a global sales presence with customers from over 80 countries, and we sell our products and services both directly and indirectly through channel partners with support from our sales force. Channel partners include distributors, value added resellers, system integrators and service providers. These partners sell directly to and service end customers and often provide additional value added services such as system installation, technical support, and professional support services in addition to equipment sales. Our sales efforts are generally organized and fitted according to geographical regions for target carriers, service providers, municipalities and enterprise customers. 
  
• | Americas Sales. Our Americas Sales organization includes coverage of North America and Latin America regions. On the functional side, the Americas Sales organization also manages our inside sales and sales engineer activities. The organization establishes and maintains direct and indirect relationships with customers in the Americas, which includes carriers and service providers, cable operators, utilities and enterprises. In addition, this organization is responsible for managing our distribution channel.

Our marketing team works closely with our sales, research and product development organizations, and our customers by providing communications that keep the market current on our products and features. Marketing also identifies and sizes new target markets for our products, creates awareness of our company and products, generates contacts and leads within these targeted markets, performs outbound education and public relations, and participates in industry associations and standard industry bodies to promote the growth of the overall industry.
 Our backlog consists of purchase orders for products and services that we expect to ship or perform within the next year. Our backlog may fluctuate based on the timing of when purchase orders are received. As of December 31, 2018, our backlog was $47.3 million, compared to $24.4 million at December 31, 2017. We consider backlog to be an indicator, but not the sole predictor, of future sales because our customers may cancel or defer orders without penalty.
 Competition
 We compete in communications equipment markets, providing products and services for the delivery of voice, data and video services. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to solutions that offer superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in our core business, including ADTRAN, Calix, Huawei, Nokia, and ZTE, among others. 
In our FiberLAN business, our competitors include Cisco, Nokia, and Tellabs, among others. In our Ethernet switching business, our competitors include Arris, Cisco and Juniper Networks, among others. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products and solutions address, both domestically and internationally. The overall number of our competitors may increase, and the identity and composition of competitors may change. As we continue to expand our sales globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do.
 The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:
  
• | product performance;
--+---------------------


• | feature capabilities;
--+----------------------


• | manufacturing capacity;
--+------------------------


• | interoperability with existing products;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | scalability and upgradeability;
--+--------------------------------


• | conformance to standards;
--+--------------------------


• | breadth of services;
--+---------------------


• | reliability;
--+-------------


• | ease of installation and use;
--+------------------------------


• | geographic footprints for products;
--+------------------------------------


• | ability to provide customer financing;
--+---------------------------------------


• | pricing;
--+---------


• | technical support and customer service; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | brand recognition.
--+-------------------

 While we believe that we compete successfully with respect to each of these factors, we expect to face intense competition in our markets. In addition, the inherent nature of communications networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies.
 Manufacturing and Operations
 
Operationally, we use a global sourcing procurement program to purchase and manage key raw materials and subassemblies through qualified suppliers, sub-contractors, original equipment and design manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service vendors. The manufacturing process uses a strategic combination of procurement from qualified suppliers and in-house manufacturing, throughout the process we manage the assembly, quality assurance, customer testing, final inspection and shipping of our products
 6



We manufacture our low volume, high mix products at our manufacturing facility in the Florida, USA and Hannover, Germany, through the acquisition of Keymile. For certain products, we rely on subcontractors and original design manufacturers for high volume, low mix products.
 
Some completed products are procured to our specifications and shipped directly to our customers. We also acquire completed products from certain suppliers, which we configure and ship from our facility. Some of these purchases are significant. We purchase both standard off-the-shelf parts and components, which are generally available from more than one supplier, and single-source parts and components. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies to meet customer demand in a timely manner from our current vendors, or, when necessary, from alternate vendors. We believe that alternate vendors can be identified if current vendors are unable to fulfill our needs, or design changes can be made to employ alternate parts.
 
We design, specify, and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet our quality standards. Our manufacturing and test engineers work closely with our design engineers to ensure manufacturability and testability of our products, and to ensure that manufacturing and testing processes evolve along with our technologies. Our manufacturing engineers specify, build, or procure our test stations, establish quality standards and protocols, and develop comprehensive test procedures and processes to assure the reliability and quality of our products. Products that are procured complete or partially complete are inspected, tested, or audited for quality control.
 
Our Quality Management System is compliant with, and we are certified to, ISO-9001:2015 by our external registrar, National Standards Authority of Ireland. ISO-9001:2015 requires that our processes be documented, followed and continuously improved. Internal audits are conducted on a regular schedule by our quality assurance personnel, and external audits are conducted by our external registrar each year. Our quality system is based upon our model for quality assurance in production and service to ensure our products meet rigorous quality standards.
 
We believe that we have sufficient production capacity to meet current and future demand for our product offerings through a combination of existing and added capacity, additional employees and the outsourcing of products or components.
 Compliance with Regulatory and Industry Standards
 Our products must comply with a significant number of voice and data regulations and standards which vary by jurisdiction. Standards for new services continue to 
evolve, and we may need to modify our products or develop new versions to meet these standards. Standards setting and compliance verification in the United States are determined by the Federal Communications Commission, Underwriters Laboratories, Quality Management Institute, Telcordia Technologies, Inc., and other communications companies. In international markets, our products must comply with standards issued, implemented and enforced by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions, as applicable, such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (“ETSI”), among others.
Environmental Matters
 Our operations and manufacturing processes are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. Such laws 
and regulations relate to the presence, use, handling, storage, discharge and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, the pre-treatment and discharge of process waste waters and the control of process air pollutants. Under certain laws of the United States, we can be held responsible for cleanup costs at currently or formerly owned or operated locations or at third party sites to which our wastes were sent for disposal.  To date, liabilities relating to contamination have not been significant, and have not had a material impact on our operations or results. We believe that our operations and manufacturing processes currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of our products. In addition, such regulations could require us to incur significant expenses to comply with environmental laws or regulations, including expenses associated with the redesign of any non-compliant product or the development or installation of additional pollution control technology. From time to time new laws or regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such laws or regulations will be implemented and enforced, or the impact they will have on our operations or results. For example, in 2003 the European Union enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, for implementation in European Union member states. Similar legislation could be currently in force or that are being considered in the United States or other countries, such as Japan and China. We are aware of and are taking suitable action to comply with the new European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances standards. Our failure to comply with any regulatory requirements or contractual obligations relating to environmental matters or hazardous materials could result in us being liable for costs, fines, penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the jurisdictions where such laws or the regulations apply.

Audit Committee Investigation
 On March 21, 2017, our Audit Committee concluded, in consultation with management and after informing our former independent registered public accounting firm, that Legacy Zhone's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
 contained in its Amendment No. 2 to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 should no longer be relied upon due to material errors associated with the sale and subsequent return of certain products sold in December 2014. 
 In connection with such findings, our
 Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation to determine whether any Legacy Zhone 
financial statements prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016 contained material errors.  In July 2017, our Audit Committee concluded, in consultation with management and after informing our former independent registered public accounting firm, that Legacy Zhone's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters en
ded March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and March 31, 2016, and Legacy Zhone's audited consolidated financial statements and assessments of internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in its Annual Reports on Form 10-K should no longer be relied upon. 
 The errors in Legacy Zhone's financial statements for pre-Merger 
periods do not impact DZS’s financial statements after the closing of the Merger because DNS is treated as an accounting acquirer of DZS.
 Matters relating to or arising from our
 Audit Committee investigation, and the associated material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity, (a) have caused us to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and other costs, (b) have exposed us to greater risks associated with civil litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, (c) have diverted resources and attention that would otherwise be 
directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy and (d) may have impacted our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed over 670 staff members worldwide. We consider the relationships with our employees to be positive. Competition for technical personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.
