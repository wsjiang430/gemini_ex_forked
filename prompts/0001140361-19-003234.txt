ITEM 1: | Business.
--------+----------



As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” ”Macatawa” and “Company” mean Macatawa Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning.  The term “Bank” means Macatawa Bank.
 
Macatawa Bank Corporation is a Michigan corporation, incorporated in 1997, and is a registered bank holding company. It wholly-owns Macatawa Bank, Macatawa Statutory Trust I and Macatawa Statutory Trust II. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan chartered bank with depository accounts insured by the FDIC. The Bank operates twenty-six branch offices and a lending and operational service facility, providing a full range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern Allegan County, Michigan. Macatawa Statutory Trusts I and II are grantor trusts and have issued $20.0 million each of pooled trust preferred securities. These trusts are not consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information regarding consolidation, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
At December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $1.98 billion, total loans of $1.41 billion, total deposits of $1.68 billion and shareholders’ equity of $190.9 million.  We recognized net income of $26.4 million in 2018 compared to net income of $16.3 million in 2017.  Earnings in 2017 were reduced by $2.5 million to record the impact of tax reform enacted in 2017 on the value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets.  Earnings before income tax in 2018 and 2017 improved over their respective previous years through growth in total revenue, primarily net interest income, while holding noninterest expenses flat.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s and the Bank’s risk-based regulatory capital ratios were significantly above those required under the regulatory standards and the Bank continued to be categorized as “well capitalized” at December 31, 2018.
 
On December 22, 2017, “H.R.1”, also known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, was signed into law.  This new tax law, among other items, reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This tax rate change reduced our federal income tax liability during 2018.  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require companies to re-value their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment.  Since the enactment took place in December 2017, we revalued our net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in a $2.5 million reduction to earnings in 2017.
 
The Company paid a cash dividend of $0.04 per share for the first and second quarters of 2017 and $0.05 per share for the third and fourth quarters of 2017.  The Company increased the dividend to $0.06 per share for the first, second and third quarters of 2018, and to $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Over the past several years, much progress has been made at reducing our nonperforming assets.  The following table reflects period end balances of these nonperforming assets as well as total loan delinquencies.

We recorded a provision for loan losses of $450,000 in 2018 due to loan portfolio growth and net charge-offs during the year.  Our earnings in 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by negative provisions for loan losses of $1.35 million and $1.35 million, respectively.  The negative provisions in these periods were impacted by recoveries from our collection efforts and a continual decline in our historical charge-off levels from prior years.

While we did experience net charge-offs in 2018, it came after we had experienced five consecutive full years of net recoveries.  The following table reflects the provision for loan losses for the past three years along with certain metrics that impact the determination of the level of the provision for loan losses.

Economic conditions in our market areas of Grand Rapids and Holland have been good during the past several years.  The state of Michigan’s unemployment rate at the end of 2018 was 3.9%.  The Grand Rapids and Holland area unemployment rate was 2.5% at the end of 2018.  Residential housing values and commercial real estate property values have increased in recent years.
 
It also appears that the housing market in our primary market area continues to be strong.  In the Grand Rapids market during 2018, living unit starts were consistent with levels experienced over the past five years.  The Holland-Grand Haven/Lakeshore region showed similar results.
 
We experienced strong commercial loan growth in recent years. Most of our emphasis has been on growing commercial and industrial loans.  These loans have increased steadily from $449.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $513.3 million at December 31, 2018.  Commercial real estate loans have increased from $518.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $568.7 million at December 31, 2018.  Consumer loans have increased from $313.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $323.6 million at December 31, 2018.  We believe we are positioned for continued loan growth in 2019.
 
We have no material foreign loans, assets or activities. No material part of our business is dependent on a single customer or very few customers.  Our loan portfolio is not concentrated in any one industry.

Products and Services
 
Loan Portfolio
 
We have historically offered a broad range of loan products to business customers, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, and to retail customers, including residential mortgage and consumer loans.  Select, well-managed loan renewal activity is taking place and we are seeing growth in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios and pipelines.  Following is a discussion of our various types of lending activities.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
 
Our commercial and industrial lending portfolio contains loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance operations and equipment. Generally, our commercial and industrial lending has been limited to borrowers headquartered, or doing business, in our primary market area.  These credit relationships typically require the satisfaction of appropriate loan covenants and debt formulas, and generally require that the Bank be the primary depository bank of the business.  These loan covenants and debt formulas are monitored through periodic, required reporting of accounts receivable aging schedules and financial statements, and in the case of larger business operations, reviews or audits by independent professional firms.
 
 - 2 -
 
Commercial and industrial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business.  As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and economic conditions.  Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
Our commercial real estate loans consist primarily of construction and development loans and multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans.
 
Construction and Development Loans.   These consist of construction loans to commercial customers for the construction of their business facilities.  They also include construction loans to builders and developers for the construction of one- to four-family residences and the development of one- to four-family lots, residential subdivisions, condominium developments and other commercial developments.
 
This portfolio can be affected by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building.  During the past several years, we made a significant effort to reduce exposure to residential land development and other construction and development loans.
 
Multi-Family and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans.   These are permanent loans secured by multi-family and other non-residential real estate and include loans secured by apartment buildings, condominiums, small office buildings, small business facilities, medical facilities and other non-residential building properties, substantially all of which are located within our primary market area.
 
Multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family residences.  This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans.  Furthermore, the repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project.  For example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations, cash flow from the project will be reduced.   If cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
Retail Loans
 
Our retail loans are loans to consumers and consist primarily of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans.
 
Residential Mortgage Loans.   We originate construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences and owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which are generally long-term with either fixed or adjustable interest rates.  Our general policy is to sell the majority of our fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market due primarily to the interest rate risk associated with these loans.  For 2018, we retained loans representing 66% of the total dollar volume originated, compared to 48% in 2017.
 
Our borrowers generally qualify and are underwritten using industry standards for quality residential mortgage loans.  We do not originate loans that are considered “sub-prime”.  Residential mortgage loan originations derive from a number of sources, including advertising, direct solicitation, real estate broker referrals, existing borrowers and depositors, builders and walk-in customers.  Loan applications are accepted at most of our offices and online. The substantial majority of these loans are secured by one-to-four family properties in our market area.
 
Consumer Loans.   We originate a variety of different types of consumer loans, including automobile loans, home equity lines of credit and installment loans, home improvement loans, deposit account loans and other loans for household and personal purposes.  We also originate home equity lines of credit utilizing the same underwriting standards as for home equity installment loans. Home equity lines of credit are revolving line of credit loans.  The majority of our existing home equity line of credit portfolio has variable rates with floors and ceilings, interest only payments and a maximum maturity of ten years.
 
The underwriting standards that we employ for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.  Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.  Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles.  In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.  In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.

We solicit deposit services from individuals, businesses, associations, churches, nonprofit organizations, financial institutions and government authorities.  Deposits are gathered primarily from the communities we serve through our network of 26 branches.   We offer business and consumer checking accounts, regular and money market savings accounts, and certificates of deposit with many term options.

Securities Portfolio
 
Our securities portfolio is classified as either “available for sale” or “held to maturity.”  Securities classified as “available for sale” may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risks, and availability of alternative investments, or to meet our liquidity needs.
 
The primary objective of our investing activities is to provide for the safety of the principal invested. Our secondary considerations include the maximization of earnings, liquidity and to help decrease our overall exposure to changes in interest rates.  We have generally invested in bonds with lower credit risk, primarily those secured by government agencies or insured municipalities, to assist in the diversification of credit risk within our asset base.  The commercial bond component of this category decreased by $10.0 million in 2018.
 
These bonds represent financing provided to some of our non-profit commercial customers who qualified for borrowing on a tax-exempt basis.  We have not experienced any credit losses within our securities portfolio.
 
The following table reflects the composition of our securities portfolio as of the dates indicated (includes securities available for sale and held to maturity).

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
The following is a summary of statutes and regulations affecting Macatawa Bank Corporation and Macatawa Bank.  A change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on us and our business.
General
 
Financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities.  Those authorities include, but are not limited to, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”), the FDIC, the State of Michigan’s Department of Financial and Insurance Services (“DIFS”), the Internal Revenue Service, and state taxing authorities. The effect of such statutes, regulations and policies can be significant, and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty.
 
Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies regulate, among other things, the scope of business, investments, reserves against deposits, capital levels relative to operations, lending activities and practices, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations and declaration and payment of dividends.  The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our bank establishes a comprehensive framework for our respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund, our depositors, and the public, rather than our shareholders.
 
Federal law and regulations establish supervisory standards applicable to our lending activities, including internal controls, credit underwriting, loan documentation and loan-to-value ratios for loans secured by real property.
 
Recent Developments
 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:  On December 22, 2017, “H.R.1”, also known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, was signed into law.  This new tax law, among other items, reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. This tax rate change reduced the Company’s federal income tax liability in 2018.  However, the new tax law impacted the Company’s 2017 operating results as well.  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require companies to re-value their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment.  Since the enactment took place in December 2017, the Company revalued its net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in a $2.5 million reduction to earnings in 2017.
Macatawa Bank Corporation
 
General.  Macatawa Bank Corporation is registered as a bank holding company with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”).  Under the BHCA, Macatawa Bank Corporation is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic reports of our operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require.
 
In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, Macatawa Bank Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank.  In addition, if the DIFS deems the Bank’s capital to be impaired, the DIFS may require the Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment upon Macatawa Bank Corporation as the Bank’s sole shareholder.  If Macatawa Bank Corporation were to fail to pay any such assessment, the directors of the Bank would be required, under Michigan law, to sell all or part of the shares of the Bank’s stock owned by Macatawa Bank Corporation to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore the Bank’s capital.
 
Investments and Activities.  In general, any direct or indirect acquisition by us of any voting shares of any bank which would result in our direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank, and any merger or consolidation between us and another financial holding company or bank holding company, will require the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA.
 
The merger or consolidation of the Bank with another bank, or the acquisition by the Bank of assets of another bank, or the assumption of liability by the Bank to pay any deposits of another bank, will require the prior written approval of the FDIC under the Bank Merger Act and DIFS under the Michigan Banking Code.  In addition, in certain such cases, an application to, and the prior approval of, the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA may be required.
 
Capital Requirements.  The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies.  If capital falls below minimum guidelines, a bank holding company may, among other things, be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses.

Additional information on our capital ratios may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading “Capital Resources” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.
 
Dividends.  Macatawa Bank Corporation is a corporation separate and distinct from the Bank.  Most of our revenues are dividends paid by the Bank.  Thus, Macatawa Bank Corporation’s ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is indirectly limited by restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends described below.  Further, in a policy statement, the Federal Reserve Board has expressed its view that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends if its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.  The Federal Reserve Board also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations.  Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.  Similar enforcement powers over our Bank are possessed by the FDIC.  The “prompt corrective action” provisions of federal law and regulation authorizes the FDIC to restrict the payment of dividends to Macatawa Bank Corporation by our Bank if the Bank fails to meet specified capital levels.
 
In addition, the Michigan Business Corporation Act provides that dividends may be legally declared or paid only if after the distribution a corporation can pay its debts as they come due in the usual course of business and its total assets equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any holders of preferred stock whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.
 
Additional information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is here incorporated by reference.
 
Federal Securities Regulation.   Our common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.  We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes numerous reporting, accounting, corporate governance and business practices on companies, as well as financial and other professionals who have involvement with the U.S. public markets.  We are generally subject to these requirements and applicable SEC rules and regulations.
 
Macatawa Bank
 
General.  Macatawa Bank is a Michigan banking corporation, and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC.  As a DIF-insured Michigan-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the DIFS, as the chartering authority for Michigan banks, and the FDIC, as administrator of the DIF.  These agencies, and the federal and state laws applicable to the Bank and its operations, extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business, including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of noninterest bearing reserves on deposit accounts, and the safety and soundness of banking practices.
 
Deposit Insurance.  As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of four categories and assessed insurance premiums, based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory evaluation.  Institutions categorized as well-capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered healthy pay the lowest premium, while institutions that are categorized as less than adequately capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium.  Risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period.
 
The FDIC’s deposit insurance assessment base methodology uses average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity as the assessment base.  Under this calculation, most well capitalized banks will pay 5 to 9 basis points annually, increasing up to 35 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns.  This base rate may be adjusted for the level of unsecured debt and brokered deposits, resulting in adjusted rates ranging from 2.5 to 9 basis points annually for most well capitalized banks to 30 to 45 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns.  We estimate our annual assessment rate to be 3 basis points in 2019.  The FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund exceeded its targeted reserve ratio of 1.35% and the FDIC sent the Bank a letter dated January 24, 2019 notifying the Bank that it would be apportioned a share of the excess in the form of credits to offset future assessments.  The preliminary assessment credit for the Bank was approximately $400,000.  Total FDIC assessment expense for 2018 was $518,000, so this will significantly reduce the Bank’s expense in 2019.

FICO Assessments.   The Bank, as a member of the DIF, is subject to assessments to cover the payments on outstanding obligations of the Financing Corporation (“FICO”).  From now until the maturity of the outstanding FICO obligations in 2019, DIF members will share the cost of the interest on the FICO bonds on a pro rata basis.  It is estimated that FICO assessments during this period will be less than 0.025% of deposits.
 
Capital Requirements.  The FDIC has established the following minimum capital standards for FDIC insured banks:  a leverage requirement consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets and risk-based capital requirements consisting of a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets, and a ratio of common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to risk weighted assets.  Tier 1 capital consists principally of shareholders’ equity.  Common equity Tier 1 capital excludes forms of stock that are not common stock.
 
Basel III. In July 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. banks (commonly known as Basel III). Under the final rules, which began for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 and are subject to a phase-in period through January 1, 2019, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CET1 ratio) of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which when fully phased-in, effectively results in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7.0%. Basel III raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% (which, with the capital conservation buffer, effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% when fully phased-in), effectively results in a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (with the capital conservation buffer fully phased-in), and requires a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Basel III also makes changes to risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. We expect that the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank under Basel III will continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements.
 
Federal regulations define these capital categories as follows:
 

 | CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Leverage Ratio 
-------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------
Well capitalized | 6.5% or above | 8% or above | 10% or above | 5% or above 
Adequately capitalized | 4.5% or above | 6% or above | 8% or above | 4% or above 
Undercapitalized | Less than 4.5% | Less than 6% | Less than 8% | Less than 4% 
Significantly undercapitalized | Less than 3% | Less than 4% | Less than 6% | Less than 3% 
Critically undercapitalized | — | — | — | Ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less

 
Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.  Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include:  requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; restricting transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; ordering a new election of directors of the institution; requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.
 
In general, a depository institution may be reclassified to a lower category than is indicated by its capital levels if the appropriate federal depository institution regulatory agency determines the institution to be otherwise in an unsafe or unsound condition or to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice.  This could include a failure by the institution, following receipt of a less-than-satisfactory rating on its most recent examination report, to correct the deficiency.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized”.   Additional information on our capital ratios may be found in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.
 
Dividends.  Under Michigan law, the Bank is restricted as to the maximum amount of dividends it may pay on its common stock.  The Bank may not pay dividends except out of net income after deducting its losses and bad debts. A Michigan state bank may not declare or pay a dividend unless the bank will have surplus amounting to at least 20% of its capital after the payment of the dividend.
 
Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.  The FDIC may prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC.  In addition, the FDIC may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank, if such payment is determined to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

Additional information about restrictions on payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.
 
Insider Transactions.  The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa, on investments in the stock or other securities of Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa as collateral for loans.  Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to Macatawa’s directors and officers, to our principal shareholders and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal shareholders.  In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of our company or any subsidiary or a principal shareholder in our company may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.
 
Safety and Soundness Standards.  The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions.  These guidelines establish standards for, among other things, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
 
Investments and Other Activities.  Under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank.  Federal law, as implemented by FDIC regulations, also prohibits FDIC insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank or its subsidiary, respectively, unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF.  Impermissible investments and activities must be divested or discontinued within certain time frames set by the FDIC in accordance with federal law.
 
Consumer Protection Laws.  The Bank’s business includes making a variety of types of loans to individuals. In making these loans, we are subject to state usury and regulatory laws and to various federal laws and regulations, including the privacy of consumer financial information provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which prohibit discrimination, specify disclosures to be made to borrowers regarding credit and settlement costs, and regulate the mortgage loan servicing activities of the Bank, including the maintenance and operation of escrow accounts and the transfer of mortgage loan servicing.  In receiving deposits, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal law and regulations, including the Truth in Savings Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  Violation of these laws could result in the imposition of significant damages and fines upon the Bank and its directors and officers.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC Regulation.  A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (“BSA”) and subsequent laws and regulations require the Bank to take steps to prevent the use of the Bank or its systems from facilitating the flow of illegal or illicit money or terrorist funds.  Those requirements include ensuring effective Board and management oversight, establishing policies and procedures, performing comprehensive risk assessments, developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities, ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive independent audit of BSA compliance activities.
 
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”) significantly expanded the anti-money laundering (“AML”) and financial transparency laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Regulations promulgated under the Patriot Act impose various requirements on financial institutions, such as standards for verifying client identification at account opening and maintaining expanded records (including “Know Your Customer” and “Enhanced Due Diligence” practices) and other obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to aid the process of preventing, detecting, and reporting money laundering and terrorist financing. An institution subject to the Patriot Act must provide AML training to employees, designate an AML compliance officer and annually audit the AML program to assess its effectiveness. The FDIC continues to issue regulations and additional guidance with respect to the application and requirements of BSA and AML.
 
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. Based on their administration by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), these are typically known as the “OFAC” rules. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “United States persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to United States jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of United States persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC.

 Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA, AML and OFAC programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution and result in material fines and sanctions.
 
Branching Authority.   Michigan banks have the authority under Michigan law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Michigan, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals.  Banks may establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks.  The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law.
 
Michigan law permits both U.S. and non-U.S. banks to establish branch offices in Michigan.  The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of the DIFS, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan.  A Michigan bank holding company may acquire a non-Michigan bank and a non-Michigan bank holding company may acquire a Michigan bank.
