Item 1. | Business

Introduction
Founded in 1847, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the United States. We are a major supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry from our mines and pellet plants located in Michigan and Minnesota. By 2020, we expect to be the sole producer of HBI in the Great Lakes region with the development of our first production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Driven by the core values of safety, social, environmental and capital stewardship, our employees endeavor to provide all stakeholders with operating and financial transparency.
In alignment with our strategic goals, we have become a North America-centric business and have updated the names of our operating segments. We are now organized according to our differentiated products. We have two reportable segments – the Mining and Pelletizing segment (formerly known as U.S. Iron Ore) and the Metallics segment.
In our Mining and Pelletizing segment, we currently own or co-own four operational iron ore mines plus one indefinitely idled mine. We are currently operating one iron ore mine in Michigan and three iron ore mines in Minnesota, and all four mines are currently operating at or near full capacity. The Empire mine located in Michigan was indefinitely idled beginning in August 2016. In our Metallics segment, we are currently constructing an HBI production plant in Toledo, Ohio. We expect to complete construction and begin production in 2020.
We are Focused on Protecting our Core Mining and Pelletizing Business 
We are the market-leading iron ore producer in the U.S., supplying differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major North American blast furnace steel producers. We have the unique advantage of being a low-cost, high-quality, iron ore pellet producer with significant transportation and logistics advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market effectively. The pricing structure and long-term nature of our existing contracts, along with our low-cost operating profile, position our Mining and Pelletizing segment as a strong cash flow generator in most commodity pricing environments. Since instituting our strategy in 2014 of focusing on this core business, we have achieved significant accomplishments, including providing accelerating profitability growth each year since 2015, maximizing commercial leverage in pricing and securing sales volume certainty by signing multiple new supply agreements with steelmakers throughout the Great Lakes region, improving operating reliability by making operational improvements, realizing more predictability in cash flows, embracing the global push toward environmental stewardship and developing new pellet products to meet ever-evolving market demands.
We recognize the importance of our strong position in the North American blast furnace steel industry, and our top priority is to protect and enhance the market position of our Mining and Pelletizing business. This involves continuing to deliver high-quality, custom-made pellets that allow our customers to remain competitive in the quality, production efficiency, and environmental friendliness of their steel products. Protecting the core business also involves continually evaluating opportunities to expand both our production capacity and ore reserve life. In 2017, we achieved key accomplishments toward these goals by acquiring the remaining minority stake in our Tilden and Empire mines as well as additional real estate interests in Minnesota. In 2018, we began supplying pellets under two new customer supply agreements in the Great Lakes region. In addition, we executed the efficient exit of our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business, officially completing the divestiture of the Company's non-core assets.
Expanding our Customer Base and Product Offering
While we hold a strong market position in supplying iron ore to Great Lakes blast furnaces, we cannot ignore the ongoing shift of steelmaking share in the U.S. away from our core blast furnace customers to EAF steelmakers. Over the past 25 years, the market share of EAFs has nearly doubled. However, as EAFs have moved to higher-value steel products, they require more high-quality iron ore-based metallics instead of lower-grade scrap as raw material feedstock. As a result of this trend, one of our top strategic priorities is to become a critical supplier of the EAF market by providing these specialized metallics. HBI is a specialized high-quality iron alternative to scrap and pig iron that, when used as a feedstock, allows the EAF to produce more valuable grades of steel. In June 2017, we announced the planned construction of an HBI production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Over the past 18 months, we have made significant progress on the construction of this plant. Based on current market analysis, greater-than-expected customer demand and expansion opportunities identified during the construction process, we are increasing the expected productive capacity of the Toledo HBI production plant from 1.6 million to 1.9 million metric tons per year. Accordingly, we now estimate the construction cost to be approximately $830 million, exclusive of construction-related contingencies and 
4

capitalized interest, which increase partially relates to the expanded capacity. We expect that the HBI production plant, once operational, will consume approximately 2.8 million long tons of our DR-grade pellets per year.
We expect our HBI to partially replace the over 3 million metric tons of ore-based metallics that are imported into the Great Lakes region every year from Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and Venezuela, as well as the nearly 20 million metric tons of scrap used in the Great Lakes area every year. The Toledo site is in close proximity to over 20 EAFs, giving us a natural competitive freight advantage over import competitors. Not only does this production plant create another outlet for our high-margin pellets, but it also presents an attractive economic opportunity for us. As the only producer of DR-grade pellets in the Great Lakes region and with access to abundant, low-cost natural gas, we will be in a unique position to serve clients in the area and grow our customer base. 
Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, to decide how to allocate resources and to assess performance. In alignment with our strategic goals, our Company’s continuing operations are organized and managed in two business units according to our differentiated products. The former 'U.S. Iron Ore' segment is now 'Mining and Pelletizing.' In addition, the Toledo HBI business will be categorized under the segment 'Metallics.' Until operational, expenses reported in the Metallics segment will be limited to administrative costs. Each of our business units qualifies as an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. As of December 31, 2018, the Mining and Pelletizing segment and the Metallics segment are both reportable segments in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting.
Financial information about our segments is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and NOTE 3 - SEGMENT REPORTING.
Mining and Pelletizing Segment
We are a major producer of iron ore pellets, primarily selling production from our Mining and Pelletizing segment to integrated steel companies in the U.S. and Canada. We operate four iron ore mines: the Tilden mine in Michigan and the Northshore, United Taconite and Hibbing mines in Minnesota. These mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 27.4 million long tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 55% of total U.S. pellet production capacity. Based on our equity ownership in these mines, our share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 21.2 million long tons, representing 42% of total U.S. annual pellet capacity. The Empire mine located in Michigan, which historically had annual rated capacity of 5.5 million long tons, was indefinitely idled beginning in August 2016. During 2017, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interest of the Empire and Tilden mines from ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, respectively. We are the manager of the Hibbing mine and rely on our joint venture partners to make their required capital contributions and to pay for their share of the iron ore pellets that we produce. In 2018, we tendered our resignation as the mine manager of the Hibbing mine and plan to transition this role to the majority owner in August 2019.
The following chart summarizes the estimated annual pellet production capacity and percentage of total U.S. pellet production capacity for each of the respective iron ore producers as of December 31, 2018:

Our Mining and Pelletizing segment production generally is sold pursuant to long-term supply agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we produced a total of 26.3 million long tons of iron ore pellets. The 2018 production included 20.3 million long tons for our account and 6.0 million long tons on behalf of our steel company partners associated with the Hibbing mine. During 2017 and 2016, we produced a total of 25.5 million and 23.4 million long tons, respectively. 
We produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard, fluxed and DR-grade, for use in our customers’ operations as part of the steelmaking process. The variation in grade of iron ore pellets results from the specific chemical and metallurgical properties of the ores at each mine, the requirements of end user's steelmaking process and whether or not fluxstone is added in the process. Although the grade or grades of pellets currently delivered to each customer are based on that customer’s preferences, which depend in part on the characteristics of the customer’s steelmaking operation, in certain cases our iron ore pellets can be used interchangeably. Standard pellets require less processing, are generally the least costly pellets to produce and are called “standard” because no ground fluxstone, such as limestone or dolomite, is added to the iron ore concentrate before turning the concentrate into pellets. In the case of fluxed pellets, fluxstone is added to the concentrate, which produces pellets that can perform at higher productivity levels in the customer’s specific blast furnace and will minimize the amount of fluxstone the customer may be required to add to the blast furnace. DR-grade pellets require additional processing to make a pellet that contains higher iron and lower silica content than a standard pellet. Unlike standard or fluxed pellets, DR-grade pellets are produced to be fed into a direct reduced iron facility, which then are converted into DRI or HBI, a high-quality raw material used in an EAF.
Additionally, as the EAF steel market continues to grow in the U.S., there is an opportunity for our iron ore to serve this market by providing pellets to the alternative metallics market to produce DRI, HBI and/or pig iron. We have produced and shipped industrial trials of low-silica DR-grade pellets, which were successfully processed in two customers' DRI reactors to produce a high-quality DRI product. By 2020, we expect to sell these low-silica DR-grade pellets to our own Metallics business unit, which includes the HBI facility in Toledo, Ohio.
Each of our Mining and Pelletizing segment mines is located near the Great Lakes. The majority of our iron ore pellets are transported via railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to blast furnace steelmakers in North America.
Upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, the timing and pattern of revenue recognition changed for our Mining and Pelletizing segment. The change in timing of revenue recognition, combined with the normal seasonal closure of the Soo Locks and the Welland Canal during the winter months, influenced our revenues to lower than historical levels during the first quarter and higher than historical levels during the remaining three quarters in 2018. We expect this pattern to continue in future years. However, we expect the total amount of revenue recognized during the year to remain substantially the same as under historical GAAP. During the first quarter, we continue to produce our products, but we cannot ship most of those products via lake vessel until the conditions on the Great Lakes are navigable, which causes our first and second quarter inventory levels to rise. Our limited practice of shipping product to ports on the lower Great Lakes or to customers’ facilities prior to the transfer of control has somewhat mitigated the seasonal effect on first and second quarter inventories, as shipment from this point to the customers’ operations is not limited by weather-related shipping constraints. As of December 31, 2018, under the new accounting standard, we had 
6

finished goods of 0.8 million long tons in transit or stored at the Port of Toledo to service customers, for which revenue had yet to be recognized. As of December 31, 2017, under the previous accounting standard, we had finished goods of 1.5 million long tons stored at ports and customer facilities on the lower Great Lakes to service customers for which revenue had yet to be recognized. Refer to NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES and NOTE 2 - NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS for further discussion on revenue recognition.
Mining and Pelletizing Customers
Our Mining and Pelletizing segment revenues primarily are derived from sales of iron ore pellets to the North American integrated steel industry, consisting primarily of three major customers. Generally, we have multi-year supply agreements with our customers. Sales volume under these agreements largely is dependent on customer requirements, and in certain cases, we are the sole supplier of iron ore to the customer. Most agreements contain a base price that is adjusted annually using one or more adjustment factors. Factors that could result in price adjustments under our contracts include changes in the Platts 62% Price, hot-rolled coil steel price, the Atlantic Basin pellet premium, published Platts international indexed freight rates and changes in specified Producer Price Indices, including those for industrial commodities, fuel and steel.
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we sold 20.6 million, 18.7 million and 18.2 million long tons of iron ore product, respectively, from our share of production from our Mining and Pelletizing segment mines. Refer to Concentration of Customers below for additional information regarding our major customers.
Metallics Segment
 In June 2017, we announced the planned construction of an HBI production plant in Toledo, Ohio. HBI is a specialized high-quality iron alternative to scrap that, when used as a feedstock, allows an EAF to produce more valuable grades of steel. We expect our HBI to partially replace the over 3 million metric tons of ore-based metallics that are imported into the Great Lakes region every year from Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and Venezuela, as well as nearly 20 million metric tons of scrap used in the Great Lakes area every year.
Over the past 18 months, we have made significant progress on the construction of this plant. Based on current market analysis, greater-than-expected customer demand and expansion opportunities identified during the construction process, we are increasing the expected productive capacity of the Toledo HBI production plant from 1.6 million to 1.9 million metric tons per year. We expect that the HBI production plant, once operational, will consume approximately 2.8 million long tons of DR-grade pellets per year from our Mining and Pelletizing segment.
Discontinued Operations
Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations.
Asia Pacific Iron Ore Operations
During 2018, we sold all of the assets of our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business through a series of sales to third parties. As a result of our planned exit, management determined that our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operating segment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and a discontinued operation under ASC Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements. As such, all current and historical Asia Pacific Iron Ore operating segment results are classified within discontinued operations.
Historically, the Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations served the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we produced 2.7 million, 10.1 million and 11.8 million metric tons, respectively, from our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operation. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we sold 3.9 million, 9.8 million and 11.6 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operation.
Refer to NOTE 13 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS for further discussion of the Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment.
Canadian Operations
During March 2018, we agreed to terms of a plan of compromise or arrangement in the CCAA proceedings with the Bloom Lake Group, the Wabush Group and the Monitor. By order of the Québec Superior Court of Justice (Commercial Division) (the “Court”) dated April 20, 2018, the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group were authorized to file a joint plan of compromise and arrangement dated April 16, 2018 (the “Original Plan”). Following discussions with various stakeholder groups, the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group were authorized by the Court to amend 
7

the Original Plan and to file an amended and restated joint plan of compromise and arrangement dated May 16, 2018 (as same may be further amended from time to time, the “Amended Plan”). The Amended Plan was approved by the required majorities of each unsecured creditor class and was sanctioned by the Court by order dated June 29, 2018 (the “Sanction Order”). Further amendments to address the manner in which certain distributions under the Amended Plan would be effected were presented to the Court on July 30, 2018. Finally, on July 31, 2018, the conditions precedent to the implementation of the Amended Plan were satisfied and the Amended Plan was implemented.
Under the terms of the Amended Plan, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries made a C$19.0 million cash contribution to the Wabush Group pension plans and agreed to contribute into the CCAA estate any remaining distributions or payments we may be entitled to receive as creditors of the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group for distribution to other creditors. The Original Plan did not resolve certain employee claims asserted against us and certain of our affiliates outside of the CCAA proceedings. The Amended Plan resolved these employee claims, all claims by the Bloom Lake Group, the Wabush Group and their respective creditors against us as well as all of our claims against the Bloom Lake Group and the Wabush Group. 
Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Canadian Entities are classified within discontinued operations. Refer to NOTE 13 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS for further discussion of the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment.
Applied Technology, Research and Development
We have been a leader in iron ore mining and processing technology since inception and have been in operation for over 170 years. We operated some of the first mines on Michigan’s Marquette Iron Range and pioneered early open-pit and underground mining methods. From the first application of electrical power in Michigan’s underground mines to the use of today’s sophisticated computers and global positioning satellite systems, we have been a leader in the application of new technology to the centuries-old business of mineral extraction. Today, our engineering and technical staffs are engaged in full-time technical support of our operations, improvement of existing products and development of new products.
We are also a pioneer in iron ore pelletizing with over 60 years of experience. We are able to produce customized, environmentally friendly pellets to meet each customer’s blast furnace specifications and produce both standard and fluxed pellets. Using our technical expertise and strong market position in the United States to increase our product offering, we have started producing DR-grade pellets. In recent years, we shipped low silica DR-grade pellets, which were successfully processed in multiple DRI reactors to produce a high-quality direct reduced iron product.
With our experienced technical professionals and unsurpassed reputation for our pelletizing technology, we continue to deliver a world-class quality product to our customers. We are a pioneer in the development of emerging reduction technologies, a leader in the extraction of value from challenging resources and a front-runner in the implementation of safe and sustainable technology. Our technical experts are dedicated to excellence and deliver superior technical solutions tailored to our customer base. We are also devoted to promoting environmental sustainability in our industry, primarily evidenced with the development of our HBI facility in Toledo, Ohio. Similar to the market shift to pellets over 60 years ago, we recognize the need to serve the growing EAF market and the need for less pollutive methods of steelmaking. We expect our introduction of HBI to the Great Lakes EAF market will be notable in the evolution of the steel industry.

Concentration of Customers
In 2018 and 2017, three customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated product revenue and in 2016, two customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated product revenue. Product revenue from those customers totaled $2.1 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion of our total consolidated product revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following represents sales revenue attributable to each of these customers as a percentage of total product sales for those years:

 | PercentageProduct Revenue
Customer1 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
ArcelorMittal | 57% | 48% | 51% 
AK Steel | 25% | 29% | 27% 
Algoma2 | 13% | 11% | 5% 
1 Includes subsidiaries. 
2 On October 5, 2015, we terminated the long-term agreement with Algoma; however, we entered into certain short-term contracts with Algoma throughout 2016. On May 16, 2016, we reinstated our agreement with Algoma, which took effect in January 2017. 

ArcelorMittal
Historically, and still today, our pellet supply agreements with ArcelorMittal USA were based on customer requirements, except for the Indiana Harbor East facility, which is based on customer contract obligations. The legacy agreements with ArcelorMittal USA expired at the end of December 2016 and January 2017. The parties executed a new long-term agreement, which became effective October 31, 2016, for the sale and delivery of ArcelorMittal USA’s annual tonnage requirements that fall within a specific range of volume. This latest agreement expires at the end of December 2026. Additionally, in 2018 we entered into an agreement with ArcelorMittal Dofasco to sell and deliver a portion of its annual pellet consumption requirements.
ArcelorMittal USA is a 62.3% equity participant in Hibbing. During 2017, we acquired the 21% ownership interest of ArcelorMittal USA in Empire as part of an agreement to distribute the noncontrolling interest net assets of the mine. 
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Mining and Pelletizing segment pellet sales to ArcelorMittal were 10.1 million, 8.4 million and 9.7 million long tons, respectively. 
AK Steel
In August 2013, we entered into a new agreement with AK Steel to provide iron ore pellets to AK Steel for use in its Middletown, Ohio and Ashland, Kentucky blast furnace facilities. This contract includes minimum and maximum tonnage requirements for each year between 2014 and 2023. In 2018, through contract amendments, we added tonnage with AK Steel above the maximum tonnage requirements specific to the 2018 contract year.
In 2015, we entered into an amended and restated agreement with AK Steel after it acquired Severstal Dearborn, LLC, under which we supply all of the Dearborn, Michigan facility’s blast furnace pellet requirements through 2022, subject to specified minimum and maximum requirements in certain years.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Mining and Pelletizing segment pellet sales to AK Steel were 5.8 million, 5.6 million and 4.5 million long tons, respectively.

Algoma
Algoma is a Canadian steelmaker whose common shares were owned by Essar Steel Holdings Limited. Essar Steel Algoma Inc. initiated CCAA proceedings in 2016. In November 2018, substantially all of the assets of Essar Steel Algoma Inc. were acquired by the emerging company, Algoma Steel Inc. We had a long-term supply agreement under which we were Algoma’s sole supplier of iron ore pellets through the end of 2016, and would continue to provide a portion of its pellet needs through 2024. Under the terms of a 2016 settlement reinstatement agreement approved by the CCAA court, Algoma agreed to assume the long-term supply agreement. Additionally, Algoma entered into agreements with us wherein we sell additional incremental tonnage that equates to Algoma's 2016 through 2020 annual iron ore pellet consumption. These agreements began in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and run through December 2020. Algoma assumed these contracts in the CCAA proceedings at the completion of the sale of assets forming the new entity.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Mining and Pelletizing segment pellet sales to Algoma were 3.5 million, 2.5 million and 1.2 million long tons, respectively.
Competition
In our Mining and Pelletizing business segment, we primarily sell our product to steel producers with operations in North America. We compete directly with steel companies that own interests in iron ore mines in the United States and/or Canada, including U.S. Steel, and with major iron ore pellet exporters from Eastern Canada and Brazil. 
A number of factors beyond our control affect the markets in which we sell our iron ore. Continued demand for our iron ore and the prices obtained by us primarily depend on the consumption patterns of the steel industry in the U.S., China and elsewhere around the world, as well as the availability, location, cost of transportation and competing prices. 
Environment 
Our mining activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We conduct our operations in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects.
Environmental issues and their management continued to be an important focus at each of our operations throughout 2018. In the construction and operation of our facilities, substantial costs have been and will continue to be incurred to comply with regulatory requirements and avoid undue effect on the environment. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters totaled approximately $10 million, $21 million and $15 million, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It is estimated that capital expenditures for environmental improvements will total approximately $10 million in 2019, for various water treatment, air quality, dust control, tailings management, selenium management and other miscellaneous environmental projects in our Mining and Pelletizing segment. 
Regulatory Developments
Various governmental bodies continually promulgate new or amended laws and regulations that affect us, our customers and our suppliers in many areas, including waste discharge and disposal, the classification of materials and products, air and water discharges and many other environmental, health and safety matters. Although we believe that our environmental policies and practices are sound and do not expect that the application of any current laws, regulations or permits reasonably would be expected to result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot predict the collective adverse impact of the expanding body of laws and regulations.
Specifically, there are several notable proposed or potential rulemakings or activities that could have a material adverse impact on our facilities in the future depending on their ultimate outcome: Minnesota's potential revisions to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard; evolving water quality standards for selenium and conductivity; scope of the Clean Water Act and the definition of “Waters of the United States”; Minnesota's Mercury TMDL and associated rules governing mercury air emission reductions; Climate Change and GHG Regulation; Regional Haze FIP Rule; NO2 and SO2 NAAQS; and increased administrative and legislative initiatives related to financial assurance obligations for CERCLA, mining and reclamation obligations.
Minnesota’s Withdrawal of Proposed Amendments to the Sulfate Wild Rice Water Quality Standard
The Minnesota Legislature provided $1.5 million in 2011 for a study to gather additional information about the effects of sulfate and other substances on the growth of wild rice and to support an update to the sulfate wild rice water 
10

quality standard originally adopted in 1973 by the MPCA. In August 2017, MPCA released proposed amendments of the sulfate water quality standard, which included a proposed sulfate wild rice water quality standard, a proposed list of waters where the standard would apply, and criteria for adding waters to that list. In January 2018, the proposed rule was substantially disapproved by an ALJ. The MPCA filed a request for reconsideration after changes were made to the proposed rule and it was disapproved again in April 2018. That same month the MPCA formally withdrew the proposed rule. Following two vetoed sulfate wild rice water quality standard-related bills, the Minnesota Governor established a Wild Rice Task Force by Executive Order in May 2018 that is charged with providing recommendations to the Governor’s Office on wild rice restoration and regulation. Currently, the water quality standard that has not been enforced in decades remains; and may be unenforceable because the water bodies to which the existing standard applies have never been identified specifically in rule, nor are there criteria for identifying them. For these reasons, the impact of the proposed wild rice water quality standard to us is not estimable at this time, but it could have an adverse material impact if we are required to significantly reduce sulfate in our discharges.
Conductivity
Conductivity, the measurement of water’s ability to conduct electricity, is a surrogate parameter that generally increases as the amount of dissolved minerals in water increases. In 2011, the EPA issued A Field-Based Aquatic Life Benchmark for Conductivity in Central Appalachian Streams, which established a recommended conductivity benchmark of 300 µS/cm for the region. The issuance of a benchmark outside of the established rulemaking process was subsequently the subject of litigation in 2012 where the court ruled the benchmark is nothing more than a non-binding suggestion. Three years later in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, et al. v. Elk Run Coal Co., et al., 3:12-cv-00785 (S.D. W. Va.), a judicial decision held that levels of conductivity higher than the EPA’s benchmark constituted a violation of the state’s narrative water quality standards, and were unsupported by science and contrary to decisions previously made by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the West Virginia Supreme Court. In 2015, a group filed a petition with EPA Region 5 alleging that Minnesota was failing to implement properly the state NPDES program, and one of the various allegations asserted that MPCA should be assessing compliance with the state’s narrative water quality standard against the EPA’s conductivity benchmark for the Central Appalachian region. In December 2015, the EPA provided MPCA a draft of the Protocol for Responding to Issues Related to Permitting and Enforcement which indicated that EPA staff would review available scientific basis in peer-reviewed literature as well as promulgated standards. In February 2016, EPA's Office of Research and Development endorsed use of the Field-Based Conductivity Benchmark in northeast Minnesota indicating that a value of 320 µS/cm was appropriate to protect aquatic life. In December 2016, EPA issued a notice soliciting public comments on its draft document, Field-Based Methods for Developing Aquatic Life Criteria for Specific Conductivity. According to EPA, once this document is final, states and authorized tribes located in any region of the country may use the methods to develop field-based specific conductivity criteria for adoption into water quality standards. In April 2017, comments were submitted by our trade associations providing objective evidence indicating the draft methodology was scientifically flawed and unfit for promulgation. Adoption of this methodology is not certain due to significant concerns with respect to the scientific validity of the proposed method, which is now under intense review by scientists working for various trade associations. Because the outcome of the Region 5 Petition is uncertain and the proposed Field-Based Methods for Developing Aquatic Life Criteria for Specific Conductivity is only draft guidance at this time, the exact nature and certainty of the potential risk to us cannot be predicted; however, direct application of the 320 µS/cm benchmark to our Minnesota-based assets may have a material adverse impact if the conductivity benchmark is applied to our NPDES permits.
Definition of “Waters of the United States” Under the Clean Water Act
In June 2015, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers promulgated the rule, “Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’ Under the Clean Water Act,” which attempted to add clarity to which waters are jurisdictional under the federal Clean Water Act; and applied to all Clean Water Act programs, including certain permitting programs, spill prevention programs and a state certification process. It has remained unclear how the federal and state agencies will implement and enforce this final rule, and the rule has been stayed in several states. The regulation may expand EPA’s authority under the Clean Water Act to many traditionally unregulated mine features such as mine pits, pit lakes, on-site ditches, water retention structures, and tailings basins creating a new burden on our facilities. This could be further interpreted to add questionable regulatory authority over the groundwater connections between these features and nearby traditionally navigable waters. 
11

The “Executive Order on Restoring the Rule of Law, Federalism, and Economic Growth by Reviewing the ‘Waters of the United States’ Rule” ("Executive Order") was signed by the President in February 2017. This Executive Order instructs EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review the Clean Water Rule and “publish for notice and comment a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule.” Accordingly, EPA and Army Corps of Engineers signed in December 2018 a proposed Revised Definition of "Waters of the United States" rule. The proposed rule will have a sixty-day comment period after publication in the Federal Register. The rule as proposed is not expected to have a material negative impact to our business. We are actively participating in the rulemaking and will continue assessing the potential impacts to our operations.
Selenium Discharge Regulation
In Michigan, Empire and Tilden have implemented compliance plans to manage selenium according to the permit conditions. Empire and Tilden submitted the first permit-required Selenium Storm Water Management Plan to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") in December 2011 and have updated it annually as required. The Selenium Storm Water Management Plans have outlined the activities that have been undertaken to address selenium in storm water discharges from our Michigan operations including an assessment of potential impacts to surface and groundwater. The remaining infrastructure needed for implementation of the storm water collection and conveyance system will likely be completed in 2020. A storm water treatment system for both facilities is anticipated sometime before 2028. As of December 31, 2018, included within our Empire asset retirement obligation is a discounted liability of approximately $85 million, which includes the estimated costs associated with the construction of Empire's portion of the required infrastructure and expected future operating costs of the treatment facilities. Additionally, included within our Tilden future capital plan is approximately $25 million for the construction of Tilden's portion of the required infrastructure. We are continuing to assess and develop cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies. 
In July 2016, the EPA published new selenium fish tissue limits and lower lentic and lotic water column concentration criteria, which may someday increase the cost for treatment should MDEQ adopt these new standards in lieu of the existing limits established under the Great Lakes Initiative. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or long-term impact of the water quality criteria to our business.
Mercury TMDL and Minnesota Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy
Since the 1990’s the taconite industry has voluntarily reduced and removed mercury products and supported development of mercury emission reduction technology. While TMDL regulations are contained in the Clean Water Act, Minnesota developed in 2007 a Statewide Mercury TMDL which set an objective for 93% mercury air emission reductions from 1990 levels for sources within Minnesota. The State of Minnesota has acknowledged that approximately 90% of the mercury entering the state’s airshed is from other national and international sources.
In September 2014, Minnesota promulgated the Mercury Air Emissions Reporting and Reduction Rules mandating mercury air emissions reporting and reductions from certain sources, including taconite facilities. The rule is applicable to all of our Minnesota operations and required submittal of a Mercury Reduction Plan to the MPCA by the end of 2018 with plan implementation requirements becoming effective on January 1, 2025. In the Mercury Reduction Plan, facilities must evaluate if available control technologies can technically achieve a 72% mercury reduction rate. If available control technologies cannot technically achieve a 72% mercury reduction rate, the facilities must propose alternative mercury reduction measures. One of the main tenets agreed upon for evaluating potential mercury reduction technologies during TMDL implementation and 2014 rule development proceedings was that the selected technology must meet the following “Adaptive Management Criteria”: the technology must be technically feasible; must be economically feasible; must not impact pellet quality; and must not cause excessive corrosion in the indurating furnaces or air pollution control equipment. The Mercury Reduction Plans for Cliffs’ Minnesota facilities were submitted to the MPCA in December 2018 and are currently being reviewed by the MPCA. 
There is currently no proven technology to cost effectively reduce mercury emissions from taconite furnaces to the target level of 72% while satisfying all four Adaptive Management Criteria. The Mercury Reduction Plans that were submitted to MPCA include documentation that describes the results of detailed engineering analysis and research testing on potential technologies to support this determination. The results of this analysis will guide further dialogue with the MPCA. Potential impacts to us are not estimable at this time because the submitted Mercury Reduction Plans are currently being reviewed by MPCA.

Climate Change and GHG Regulation
With the complexities and uncertainties associated with the U.S. and global navigation of the climate change issue as a whole, one of our potentially significant risks for the future is mandatory carbon pricing obligations. Policymakers are in the design process of carbon regulation at the state, regional, national and international levels. The current regulatory patchwork of carbon compliance schemes presents a challenge for multi-facility entities to identify their near-term risks. Amplifying the uncertainty, the dynamic forward outlook for carbon pricing obligations presents a challenge to large industrial companies to assess the long-term net impacts of carbon compliance costs on their operations. Our exposure on this issue includes both the direct and indirect financial risks associated with the regulation of GHG emissions, as well as potential physical risks associated with climate change adaption. We are continuing to review the physical risks related to climate change utilizing our formal ERM process. As an energy-intensive business, our GHG emissions inventory includes a broad range of emissions sources, such as iron ore furnaces and kilns, diesel mining equipment and our wholly owned Silver Bay power generation plant, among others. As such, our most significant regulatory risks are: (1) the costs associated with on-site emissions levels (direct impacts), and (2) indirect costs passed through to us from electrical and fuel suppliers (indirect impacts).
Internationally, mechanisms to reduce emissions are being implemented in various countries, with differing designs and stringency, according to resources, economic structure and politics. We expect that momentum to extend carbon regulation will continue with implementation of the Paris climate agreement that was adopted in 2015, the aim of which is to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius. Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation may have a material impact on our customer base, operations and financial results in the future.
In the U.S., future federal and/or state carbon regulation potentially presents a significantly greater impact to our operations. To date, the U.S. Congress has not legislated carbon constraints. In the absence of comprehensive federal carbon legislation, numerous state, regional, and federal regulatory initiatives are under development or are becoming effective, thereby creating a disjointed approach to GHG control and potential carbon pricing impacts. In May 2010, the EPA promulgated the GHG Tailoring Rule establishing a mechanism for regulating GHG emissions from facilities through the Prevention of Significant Deterioration permitting program under the Clean Air Act. Under the GHG Tailoring Rule, as modified by a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding some components of the rule, new projects that increase GHG emissions by a significant amount (generally more than 75,000 long tons of CO2 emissions per year) and significantly increase emissions of at least one non-GHG criteria pollutant are subject to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements, including the installation of best available control technology. We do not expect the Tailoring Rule provision to have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term and we cannot reliably estimate the long-term impact of the regulation. 
In June 2013, President Obama issued a memorandum directing EPA to develop carbon emission standards for both new and existing power plants under the Clean Air Act's New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS"). In October 2015, EPA promulgated a CPP which consists of NSPS regulating carbon dioxide from existing power plants at a level of approximately 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The CPP would not regulate combined heat and power generating facilities such as at Northshore's Silver Bay Power. The CPP directed states to submit SIPs to EPA by September 2016, but during February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP immediately halting implementation. In March 2017, President Trump signed the Energy Independence Executive Order which called for, among other things, a review of the CPP and, if appropriate, reconsideration proceedings to suspend, revise, or rescind the rule. On the same day, Administrator Pruitt signed a notice indicating EPA’s intent to review and, if appropriate, to propose to revise or rescind the CPP. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has been holding CPP litigation in abeyance since April 2017. During October 2017, following a review as directed by President Trump’s Energy Independence Executive Order, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the CPP and accepted comments on the proposed rule until mid-January 2018. The ultimate outcome of these carbon emission standards is not expected in the near term.
Due to the EPA's Tailoring Rule and potential patchwork state or regional carbon restriction schemes, our business and customer base could suffer negative financial impacts over time as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on GHG emissions. We believe our exposure can be reduced substantially by numerous factors, including currently contemplated regulatory flexibility mechanisms, such as allowance allocations, fixed process emissions exemptions, offsets and international provisions; emissions reduction opportunities, including energy efficiency, biofuels and fuel flexibility; and business opportunities associated with pursuing combined heat and power partnerships and new products, including DR-grade pellets, fluxed pellets and other efficiency-improving technologies.

We have worked proactively to develop a comprehensive, enterprise-wide GHG management strategy aimed at considering all significant aspects associated with GHG initiatives to plan effectively for and manage climate change issues, including risks and opportunities as they relate to the environment; stakeholders, including shareholders and the public; legislative and regulatory developments; operations; products and markets.
Regional Haze FIP Rule
In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to its regional haze rules. The rules require states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all Class I national parks and wilderness areas to natural background levels by 2064. Among the states with Class I areas are Michigan and Minnesota, in which we currently own and manage mining operations. The first phase of the regional haze rule required analysis and installation of Best Available Retrofit Technology ("BART") on eligible emission sources and incorporation of BART and associated emission limits into SIPs.
EPA disapproved Minnesota's and Michigan's SIPs for taconite furnaces and instead promulgated a Taconite Regional Haze FIP in February 2013. We, along with other stakeholders, petitioned the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of the FIP, and in May 2013, we filed a joint motion for stay of the 2013 FIP, which was granted in June 2013. We, along with the other stakeholders, reached a settlement agreement with EPA to resolve certain items in the 2013 FIP. The settlement agreement, which was published in the Federal Register in January 2015 and fully executed in April 2015, prompted EPA to grant partial reconsideration of the 2013 FIP in July 2015. Subsequently, EPA published a FIP revision final rule to implement components of the settlement agreement in April 2016, with an effective date of May 12, 2016. We believe the 2016 Regional Haze FIP reflects progress toward a more technically and economically feasible regional haze implementation plan. In November 2016, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals terminated the June 2013 stay and extended the deadlines in the original 2013 FIP. Cost estimates associated with implementation of the 2013 and 2016 FIPs are reflected in our five-year capital plan.
Due to inconsistencies in language describing the procedures for calculating NOx emission limits between the settlement agreement and the 2016 FIP final rule, we jointly filed a Petition for Reconsideration and Petition for Judicial Review in June 2016. We have been working toward a settlement agreement with EPA to resolve the outstanding issue with the emission limit calculation method and anticipate resolution of the issue in 2019. The outcome of this proceeding is not expected to have a material adverse impact to the business.
NO2 and SO2 NAAQS
During the first half of 2010, EPA promulgated rules that required each state to use a combination of air quality monitoring and computer modeling to determine each state's attainment classification status against new one-hour NO2 and SO2 NAAQS. During the third quarter of 2011, the EPA issued guidance to the regulated community on conducting refined air quality dispersion modeling and implementing the new NO2 and SO2 standards. In 2012, Minnesota issued Administrative Orders ("AOs") requiring taconite facilities to conduct modeling to demonstrate compliance with the NO2 and SO2 NAAQS pursuant to the Taconite Regional Haze SIP Long Term Strategy ("LTS"). Compliance with the LTS modeling demonstrations was originally set for June 2017, but Minnesota has not advanced work on its 2012 AOs and is expected to remove NAAQS modeling obligations under the LTS in light of reduction in haze emissions associated with implementation of the taconite Regional Haze FIP regulations.
All of our operations in Minnesota and Michigan are expected to be in attainment for NO2 and SO2 NAAQS without incurring additional capital investment. While we will continue to monitor these developments and assess potential impacts, we do not anticipate further capital investments will be necessary to address NO2 and SO2 NAAQS requirements at this time.

CERCLA 108(b)
In December 2016, EPA published a proposed amendment to CERCLA section 108(b) which is focused on developing financial assurance for managing hazardous substances in the hardrock mining industry. EPA had a court-mandated deadline for publication of the final rule by December 1, 2017. The proposed rule would have required hardrock mining facilities to calculate their level of financial responsibility based on a formula included in the rule, secure an instrument or otherwise self-insure for the calculated amount, demonstrate to EPA the proof of the security, and maintain the security until EPA releases facilities from the CERCLA 108(b) regulations. The iron mining industry notified EPA of several errors upon which EPA drafted the rule, including a mistaken reliance on reporting data from a wholly different industry sector (iron and steel toxic release inventory reporting). We also participated in developing industry specific and national trade association comments and advocating directly with EPA and the White House Office of Management & Budget to address this and other errors with goals of exempting iron ore mining from CERCLA 108(b) applicability and correcting other deficiencies with the proposed rule. On December 1, 2017 EPA signed a federal register notice of EPA's decision not to issue final regulations for financial responsibility requirements for the hardrock mining industry under section 108(b) of CERCLA because EPA determined that the risks associated with these facilities' operations are addressed by existing federal and state programs and regulations and modern industry practices. In 2018, several environmental groups filed a challenge to EPA's decision to not issue a final rule. This challenge is anticipated to be decided by the courts during 2019. Cliffs is participating as part of the industry intervenor party via representation through the American Iron and Steel Institute and will continue to participate in and monitor the challenge as it proceeds.
Energy
Electricity
WEPC is the sole supplier of electric power to our Tilden mine. During April 2015, the Tilden mine executed a special electricity contract with WEPC. The term of the contract is through 2019. WEPC provides 170 megawatts of electricity to Tilden at special rates that are regulated by the MPSC. The pricing under this contract is generally fixed except Tilden is subject to frequent changes in WEPC's power supply adjustment factor. During August 2016, Tilden executed a new 20-year special contract with WEPC that is anticipated to start on June 1, 2019 and would replace the previous special contract. 
Minnesota Power supplies electric power to the Hibbing and United Taconite mines. During September 2008, Hibbing finalized an agreement with terms from November 2008 through December 2015. The agreement was approved by the MPUC in 2009. The terms of the agreement included an automatic five-year extension that began January 2016. The United Taconite mine executed a new ten-year agreement with Minnesota Power that also included Northshore's Babbitt Mine. This agreement was finalized in May 2016 and was approved by the MPUC in November 2016.
Silver Bay Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary with a 115 megawatt power plant, is able to provide the majority of Northshore’s electrical energy requirements. Silver Bay Power has an interconnection agreement with Minnesota Power for backup power when excess generation is necessary. In May 2016, Silver Bay Power entered into an agreement with Minnesota Power to purchase roughly half of Northshore's electricity needs from Minnesota Power through 2019. Beginning January 1, 2020, Silver Bay Power will purchase 100% of the electricity requirements of Northshore from Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power plans to idle both of its generating units except under certain circumstances.
Process and Diesel Fuel
We have a long-term contract providing for the transport of natural gas on the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline for our Mining and Pelletizing segment operations. Tilden has the capability of burning natural gas, coal or, to a lesser extent, oil. Hibbing and Northshore have the capability to burn natural gas and oil. United Taconite has the ability to burn coal, natural gas and petroleum coke. Consistent with 2018, we expect that during 2019 our Mining and Pelletizing segment operations will utilize both natural gas and coal to heat furnaces and produce power at our Silver Bay Power facility. 
All of our mines utilize diesel fuel mainly for our mobile fleet. Thompson Gas supplies diesel fuel to all of our Mining and Pelletizing segment locations from various refineries in the Midwest. Our contracts with Thompson Gas expired at the end of 2018, and the parties are negotiating extensions on these supply agreements.

Salaried employees at our Mining and Pelletizing segment, Metallics segment, Corporate and Support Services are not represented by a union and are not, therefore, covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Safety
Safety is our primary core value as we continue toward a zero injury culture at all of our facilities. We constantly monitor, measure and track our safety performance and make continuous improvements to affect change. Best practices and incident learnings are shared globally to ensure each mine site can effectively administer our policies and procedures for enhanced workplace safety. Progress toward achieving our objectives is accomplished through a focus on proactive sustainability initiatives, and results are measured against established industry and company benchmarks, including our company-wide Total Reportable Incident Rate ("TRIR"). During 2018, our TRIR (including contractors) was 1.20 per 200,000 man-hours worked.
