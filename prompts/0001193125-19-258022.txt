ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 The following discussion of our business solely relates to ongoing operations. 
 General Development of Business 
 Our Company was founded in 1980 and has grown to become the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles (RVs) in the world. We are also the largest manufacturer of RVs in North America, and one of the largest manufacturers of RVs in Europe. The Company manufactures a wide variety of RVs in the United States and Europe, and sells those vehicles, as well as related parts and accessories, primarily to independent, non-franchise dealers throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. We are incorporated in Delaware and are the successor to a corporation of the same name which was incorporated in Nevada on July 29, 1980. Our principal executive office is located at 601 East Beardsley Avenue, Elkhart, Indiana 46514 and our telephone number is (574) 970-7460. Our Internet address is www.thorindustries.com. We maintain copies of our recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), available free of charge, on our web site. Unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, all references to Thor, the Company, we, our and us refer to Thor Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

 Acquisitions and Other Significant Events 
 Fiscal 2019 
 Erwin Hymer Group Acquisition 
 On February 1, 2019, the Company and the shareholders of Erwin Hymer Group SE (EHG or Erwin Hymer Group) closed on a transaction in which the Company acquired EHG. EHG is headquartered in Bad Waldsee, Germany, and is one of the largest RV manufacturers in Europe. The Company acquired EHG in order to expand its operations into the established but growing European market with a long-standing European industry leader. 
 At the closing, the Company paid cash consideration of approximately 1.53 billion Euro (approximately $1.76 billion at the exchange rate as of February 1, 2019) and issued 2,256,492 shares of the Companys common stock to the sellers valued at $144.2 million. The cash consideration was funded through a combination of available cash on hand of approximately $95 million and debt financing consisting of two credit facility agreements, a seven-year, $2.1 billion term loan, with an approximate $1.4 billion U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and an approximate 0.6 billion Euro tranche (approximately $0.7 billion at the exchange rate at February 1, 2019), and $100 million utilized at closing from a five-year, $750.0 million asset-based credit facility (ABL), each as more fully described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The obligations of the Company under each facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company, and both agreements contain certain customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company. 
 Certain costs incurred during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 related to this acquisition, including the foreign currency forward contract loss and certain bank fees, ticking fees, legal, advisory and other costs, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are included in Acquisition-related costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
 Fiscal 2018 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On June 19, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors authorized Company management to utilize up to $250,000 to purchase shares of the Companys common stock through June 19, 2020. 
 
1 


 Under the share repurchase plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time-to-time, outstanding shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of share repurchases will be determined by the Companys management team based upon its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase plan may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and the Company has no obligation to repurchase any amount of its common stock under the plan. If the plan is utilized, the Company intends to make all repurchases and to administer the plan in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory guidelines, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 There were no repurchases under this program during fiscal 2019 or 2018. 
 Joint Venture 
 On February 15, 2018, the Company announced the formation of TH2Connect, LLC (TH2), a joint venture with Tourism Holdings Limited (thl). TH2 was formed to own, improve and sell innovative and comprehensive digital applications through a platform designed for the global RV industry. TH2 offers a variety of products focused on enhancing the enjoyment, safety, connectivity and convenience of RV ownership and use. 
 The Company and thl each have a 50% ownership position in TH2 and equal representation on the board of directors of TH2. The Company contributed cash totaling $46,902 to TH2 in early March 2018 while thl contributed various assets with the same approximate fair value. The Companys initial investment in TH2 was funded entirely from cash on hand. Additional capital investments were made in TH2 by both Thor and thl of $6,500 and $3,500 during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. In accordance with the operating agreement between the parties, TH2s future capital needs will be funded proportionally by thl and the Company. Both thl and the Company loaned TH2 $2,157 in fiscal 2019 for working capital needs. The Companys investment in TH2 is accounted for under the equity method, and the results of this joint venture are recorded on a one-month lag basis. In July 2019, TH2 was rebranded to Togo Group. 
Tax Reform 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), was signed into law. The Tax Act includes numerous changes to tax laws impacting business, the most significant being a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. The rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018. As a result of other Tax Act changes, the Companys income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 has been impacted by, among other items, the repeal of the domestic production activities (Internal Revenue Code section 199) deduction and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. The Tax Act also included substantial changes to the taxation of foreign income which are applicable to the Company as a result of the acquisition of EHG during fiscal 2019. The Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions may also prospectively impact the Companys income tax expense. Under GILTI, a portion of the Companys foreign earnings may be subject to U.S. taxation, offset by available foreign tax credits subject to limitations. For fiscal 2019, the Company incurred no U.S. taxation related to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act. 
 The reduction in the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate is expected to positively impact the Companys future domestic after-tax earnings.

 Recreational Vehicles 
 Overview 
 We manufacture a wide variety of recreational vehicles in the United States and Europe and sell those vehicles, as well as related parts and accessories, primarily to independent, non-franchise dealers throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. North American recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the RV Industry Association (RVIA). The principal types of towable recreational vehicles that we produce in North America include conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels. In addition, we also produce equestrian and other specialty towable recreational vehicles, as well as Class A, Class C and Class B motorhomes. In Europe, we produce numerous types of towable and motorized recreational vehicles, including motorcaravans, caravans, campervans, urban vehicles and other RV-related products and services. 
 Travel trailers are non-motorized vehicles which are designed to be towed by passenger automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs or vans. Travel trailers provide comfortable, self-contained living facilities for camping and vacationing purposes. Within North America we produce conventional and fifth wheel travel trailers. Conventional trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle. Fifth wheel trailers, designed to be towed by pickup trucks, are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to a receiver in the bed area of the pickup truck.

 A motorhome is a self-powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis. Motorhomes are self-contained with their own lighting, heating, cooking, refrigeration, sewage holding and water storage facilities, so that they can be utilized without being attached to utilities. 
 Within North America, Class A motorhomes, generally constructed on medium-duty truck chassis, are supplied complete with engine and drivetrain components by motor vehicle manufacturers such as Ford, Freightliner and Spartan Motors. We design, manufacture and install the living area and drivers compartment of Class A motorhomes. Class C and Class B motorhomes are generally built on a Ford, General Motors or Mercedes Benz small truck or van chassis, which includes an engine, drivetrain components and a finished cab section. We construct a living area which has access to the drivers compartment and attaches to the cab section. Although they are not designed for permanent or semi-permanent living, motorhomes can provide comfortable living facilities for camping and vacationing purposes. 
 In Europe, motorcaravans are similar to the Class A and Class C motorized products in the North American market. Motorcaravans include various types, such as, integrated, semi-integrated and alcove, and are generally constructed on light duty truck chassis, supplied complete with engine and drivetrain components by chassis manufacturers such as Fiat, PSA Group, Mercedes and Iveco. The main difference between European motorcaravans as compared to RVs in the North American market is that the focus in Europe is on lighter and smaller vehicles due to weight restrictions and driving license requirements. 
 An integrated motorcaravan contains driving and passenger space that is completely integrated into the vehicle, along with the living area, which creates a great feeling of space. The driving/passenger and living areas are made of one compartment and form a single unit. 
 A semi-integrated motorcaravan is one whose cab (driver/passenger compartment) belongs to the chassis. This means that the existing driver/passenger area is complemented by an attached high-quality living area. As a result, all the advantages of the basic vehicle are enhanced by mobile living. 
 An alcove motorcaravan is one where there is an additional sleeping space located above the drivers cab. This superstructure is called an alcove and it comprises sleeping accommodations for two people. Behind the drivers cab is an additional bedroom and a living space with basic equipment. 
 A caravan is a travel trailer which is a non-motorized vehicle designed to be towed by passenger automobiles, SUVs or vans. Travel trailers provide comfortable, self-contained living facilities for camping and vacationing purposes. In Europe, the focus is on light and small caravans that can even be towed by small passenger cars. 
 A campervan is comparable to the Class B motorhome in the North American market. They are generally built on a Fiat, Citroen or Mercedes panel van chassis which includes an engine, drivetrain components and a finished cab section. A constructed living area provides access to the drivers compartment and attaches to the cab section. As they are smaller and more compact than typical motorhomes, a campervan has the advantage of being easier to maneuver and easier to park. 
 An urban vehicle is a multi-functional vehicle similar to a minivan that is mainly used as a family car but has a small removable kitchen and sitting area that can be converted into a sleeping area. Additionally, these vehicles are equipped with a pop-up roof to provide additional sleeping quarters. 
 Production 
 In order to minimize finished inventory, our recreational vehicles in both North America and Europe are produced generally to dealer order. Our facilities are designed to provide efficient assembly-line manufacturing of products. In North America and Europe, capacity increases can generally be achieved relatively quickly and at relatively low cost, largely by acquiring, leasing, or building additional facilities and equipment and increasing the number of production employees. In North America, capacity decreases can generally be achieved relatively quickly and at relatively low cost, mainly by decreasing the number of production employees. In Europe, short-term capacity decreases can generally be achieved by adjusting work schedules and reducing the number of contract and temporary workers. 
 We purchase many of the components used in the production of our recreational vehicles in finished form. The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing processes for motorhomes and travel trailers are aluminum, lumber, plywood, plastic, fiberglass and steel purchased from numerous suppliers. 
 Our relationship with our North American chassis suppliers is similar to our other RV vendor relationships in that no long-term contractual commitments are entered into by either party. Historically, chassis manufacturers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when chassis supply is restricted. These allocations are generally based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. Although our European operations have strategic partnerships with key chassis suppliers, we are not dependent on any one supplier in Europe. Sales of motorhomes rely on these chassis and are affected accordingly, as approximately half of the material cost of our motorhomes relates to the chassis. We have not experienced any recent significant cost increases from our chassis suppliers. 
 
5 


 Generally, our North American and European RV operating subsidiaries introduce new or improved lines or models of recreational vehicles each year. Changes typically include new sizes and floor plans, different decors or design features and engineering and technological improvements. 
 Seasonality 
 Since recreational vehicles are used primarily by vacationers and campers, our recreational vehicle sales tend to be seasonal and, in most geographical areas, tend to be lower during the winter months than in other periods. As a result, our recreational vehicle sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends on January 31 of each year. 
Marketing and Distribution 
 We sell our recreational vehicles primarily to independent, non-franchise dealers located throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. Each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries sell to their own network of independent dealers, with many dealers carrying more than one of our product lines, as well as products from other manufacturers. As of July 31, 2019, there were approximately 2,300 dealership locations carrying our products in the U.S. and Canada and approximately 1,000 dealership locations carrying our products throughout Europe. We believe that the working relationships between our management and sales personnel and the independent dealers provide us with valuable information on customer preferences and the quality and marketability of our products. 
 Our European brands distribute their vehicles in Europe through dealer networks that offer various EHG brands covering all price segments in each region, avoiding brand overlap even in regions with two or more dealers that offer EHG brands. The European dealer base is comprised primarily of independent dealers, although EHG does operate four company-owned dealerships. Approximately 30% of the independent European dealer body sells EHG brands exclusively. 
 While each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries has an independent sales force, the most important retail sales events occur at the major recreational vehicle shows which take place throughout the year at different locations across the United States, Canada and Europe. We also benefit in the United States from the recreational vehicle awareness advertising and major marketing programs sponsored by the RVIA in national print media and television. 
 In our selection of individual dealers, we emphasize the dealers ability to maintain a sufficient inventory of our products, as well as their financial stability, credit worthiness, reputation, experience and ability to provide service to the end customer. Many dealers, particularly in North America, carry the recreational vehicle lines of one or more of our competitors. Generally, each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries have separate agreements with their dealers. 
 One of our dealers, FreedomRoads, LLC, accounted for approximately 18.5% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019 and for approximately 20.0% in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. This dealer also accounted for approximately 19% of the Companys consolidated trade accounts receivable at July 31, 2019 and approximately 26% at July 31, 2018. 
 We generally do not finance dealer purchases. Most dealers are financed on a floor plan basis by an unrelated bank or financing company, which lends the dealer all or substantially all of the wholesale purchase price and retains a security interest in the vehicles purchased. As is customary in the recreational vehicle industry, we will generally execute a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealers purchase of our products upon the lending institutions request. Repurchase agreements provide that, typically for a period of up to eighteen months after a unit is financed and in the event of default by the dealer and notification from the lending institution of the dealer default, we will repurchase all the dealer units repossessed by the lending institution for the amount then due, which is often less than 100% of the dealers cost. The risk of loss under repurchase agreements is spread over numerous dealers and is further reduced by the resale value of the units which we would be required to repurchase. Based on current conditions, we believe that future losses under these agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our Company. The Companys total commercial commitments under standby repurchase obligations on dealer inventory financing as of July 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018 were $2,961,019 and $2,748,465, respectively. The losses incurred due to repurchase were not material in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. 
 Backlog 
 As of July 31, 2019, the backlog for North American towable and North American motorized recreational vehicle orders was $693,156 and $458,847, respectively, compared to $766,965 and $634,092, respectively, at July 31, 2018, reflecting decreases of 9.6% and 27.6%, respectively. These decreases are mainly attributable to our capacity expansions since the prior year allowing for increased production and therefore quicker delivery of units to dealers, elevated existing dealer inventory levels in certain locations and a more typical seasonal order pattern compared to the elevated order levels from the prior year. As of July 31, 2019, the backlog for our European segment was $852,675. 
 
6 


 Backlog represents unfilled dealer orders on a particular day which can and do fluctuate on a seasonal basis. The manufacturing time in the recreational vehicle business is relatively short. The existing backlog of the North American towable, North American motorized and European segments is expected to be filled in fiscal 2020. 
 Product Warranties 
 In North America, we generally provide retail purchasers of our recreational vehicles with a one-year or two-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship with longer warranties on certain structural components. The chassis and engines of our motorhomes are generally warranted for various periods in excess of one year by their manufacturers. In Europe, we generally offer a two-year limited warranty on certain structural components and up to a 12-year warranty against water leakage. 
Regulation 
 In the countries where we operate and our products are sold, we are subject to various vehicle safety and compliance standards. 
 Within the United States, we are a member of the RVIA, a voluntary association of recreational vehicle manufacturers which promulgates recreational vehicle safety standards in the United States. We place an RVIA seal on each of our North American recreational vehicles to certify that the RVIAs standards have been met. We also comply with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. and with similar standards within Canada and Europe as it relates to the safety of our products. 
 Governmental authorities in the regions in which we operate have various environmental control standards relating to air, water and noise pollution which affect our business and operations. For example, these standards, which are generally applicable to all companies, control our choice of paints, our air compressor discharge, our waste water and the noise emitted by our factories. We rely upon certifications obtained by chassis manufacturers with respect to compliance by our vehicles with applicable emission control standards. 
 Our plants are subject to and are periodically inspected by various governmental and industry agencies concerned with health and safety in the work place to ensure that our plants and products comply with applicable governmental and industry standards. 
 We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable vehicle safety (including those promulgated by NHTSA), environmental, industry, health, safety and other required regulations. 
 We do not believe that ongoing compliance with the existing regulations discussed above will have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, however, future developments in regulation and/or policy could impose significant challenges upon our business operations. 
 Competition 
 The recreational vehicle industry is generally characterized by low barriers to entry. The recreational vehicle market is intensely competitive, with several other manufacturers selling products that compete directly with our products. We also experience a certain level of competition between our own operating subsidiaries. Increased activity in the market for used recreational vehicles also impacts manufacturers sales of new products. Competition in the recreational vehicle industry is based upon price, design, value, quality and service. We believe that the price, design, value and quality of our products and the warranty coverage and service that we provide allow us to compete favorably for retail purchasers of recreational vehicles. There are approximately 65 RV manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada, according to RVIA and approximately 30 RV manufacturers across Europe according to Caravaning Industry Association e.V. (CIVD). 
 Our primary competitors within the North American towable and motorized segments are Forest River, Inc. and Winnebago Industries, Inc. We are the largest recreational vehicle manufacturer in North America in terms of both units produced and revenue. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., for the six months ended June 30, 2019, Thors combined U.S. and Canadian market share based on unit retail sales was approximately 47.4% for travel trailers and fifth wheels combined and approximately 36.5% for motorhomes. 
 Our primary competitors within the European segment are Trigano, Hobby/Fendt and Knaus Tabbert. EHGs European market share for the six months ended June 30, 2019 based on unit retail sales was approximately 25.5% for motorcaravans and campervans combined and approximately 21.6% for caravans. 
 Trademarks and Patents 
 We have registered United States trademarks, Canadian trademarks, German trademarks and certain other international trademarks and licenses carrying the principal trade names and model lines under which our products are marketed. We hold and protect certain patents related to our business. We are not dependent upon any patents or technology licenses of others for the conduct of our business. 
 
7 


 Employee Relations 
 At July 31, 2019, we employed approximately 21,750 full-time employees worldwide, including 14,950 full-time employees in the United States, of which approximately 1,750 were salaried, and 6,800 full-time employees in Europe, of which approximately 1,875 were salaried. None of our North American employees are represented by certified labor organizations. Within our European-based operations, we are subject to employee contracts, Works Councils and certain labor organizations. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees.
