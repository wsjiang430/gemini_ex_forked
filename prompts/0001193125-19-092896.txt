 Cancer Detection Segment 
 Background and Overview 
 Approximately 40 million mammograms were performed in the United States in 2017. Although mammography is the most effective method for early detection of breast cancer, studies have shown that an estimated 20% or more of all breast cancers go undetected in the screening stage. Observational errors are responsible for more than half of cancers missed, and computer aided detection (CAD), has been proven to reduce the risk of observational errors in mammography. Mammography CAD uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze image data and mark suspicious areas in the image that may indicate cancer. CAD assists radiologists review by identifying areas that warrant a second look or possibly contain a significant abnormality. Although CAD has potential applications for many types of cancer detection and diagnosis, as a medical imaging tool it has demonstrated the most success as an adjunct to mammography. 
 Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is rapidly replacing full-field digital mammography in screening due to its clinical value in cancer detection, but it also presents significant workflow challenges to radiologists who face the additional workload and time required to accurately read the extensive amounts of data contained in DBT cases. Further, as incidence rates of cancer continue to rise, it is becoming increasingly important to find cancer sooner, optimize radiology workflow and reduce unnecessary recalls resulting from false positives. CAD has the potential to address many of these challenges. 
 The Company offers a variety of CAD and breast density assessment solutions for use with mammography, breast tomosynthesis, and CT imaging, at both the detection and diagnosis stages of the cancer care cycle. These products have the potential to help radiologists better detect cancer and improve workflow efficiency. The Company completed development of a tomosynthesis CAD and workflow tool in 2015 and launched the product in the European market in April 2016, HealthCanada in June 2016 and in the United States after FDA clearance in April 2017. The Company also developed a breast density assessment product for tomosynthesis that assesses breast density using 2D synthetic images that are generated from 3D tomosynthesis datasets. The Companys tomosynthesis breast density solution received FDA clearance in December 2018. The Company believes that the CAD and breast density assessment solutions for breast tomosynthesis may represent a significant growth opportunity, given the large number of installation opportunities for CAD and breast density assessment solutions. The Company anticipates that CAD for tomosynthesis will become the standard of care in the near future, similar to what CAD for 2D mammography is today in the U.S. As of 2018, the U.S. alone had approximately 8,704 certified facilities providing mammography screening, which contained approximately 20,073 accredited full field digital mammography (FFDM) and tomosynthesis mammography units. The majority of these centers are using 2D digital mammography FFDM systems and we believe approximately 36% of the units are digital breast tomosynthesis units. 
 The Company believes that there is also growth opportunity for mammography CAD in international markets, both from the analog to digital conversion and as more countries adopt the practice of radiologists using CAD, rather than having two radiologists read each case. Furthermore, most Western European countries have or are planning to implement mammography screening programs, which is likely to increase the number of mammograms performed in those countries. Although sales of the Companys CAD solutions 
 
4 


  for two-dimensional mammography have been historically lower in Europe than in the U.S., the Company believes that its CAD solutions for use with three-dimensional tomosynthesis may be adopted with a higher attachment rate, due to workflow improvements and reading time reduction offered by the solutions. 
 Cancer Detection Products 
 iCAD develops and markets a comprehensive range of high-performance Artificial Intelligence cancer detection and workflow solutions for digital mammography systems worldwide. iCADs PowerLook Mammo Detection (also known as SecondLook Digital) is based on sophisticated patented algorithms that analyze the data, automatically identifying and marking suspicious regions in 2D full field digital mammography images. The solution provides the radiologist with a second look which helps the radiologist detect actionable missed cancers earlier than screening mammography alone. PowerLook Mammo Detection detects and identifies suspicious masses and micro-calcifications utilizing image processing, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence techniques. Information from thousands of mammography images are incorporated into these algorithms enabling the product to distinguish between characteristics of cancerous and normal tissue. This should result in earlier detection of hard-to-find cancers, improved workflow for radiologists, and higher quality patient care. 
 PowerLook. 
 PowerLook analyzes two-dimensional full-field digital mammography images and automatically identifies and marks suspicious masses and micro-calcifications. This provides a radiologist with a second look that detects potentially actionable missed cancers earlier than screening mammography alone. PowerLook uses sophisticated, patented algorithms together with image processing, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence techniques. These algorithms incorporate data from thousands of mammography images, enabling the product to distinguish between characteristics of cancerous and normal tissue. This enables earlier detection of hard-to-find cancers, improved workflow for radiologists, and higher quality patient care. 
 PowerLook is offered through the PowerLook Breast Health Solutions platform (the PowerLook Platform), which is the first product suite of its kind to integrate cancer detection and breast density assessment software. The assessment software, or PowerLook Density Assessment, aids radiologists by standardizing their approach to breast density assessment and categorization. PowerLook Density Assessment provides an automated, consistent and standardized reporting tool, which is particularly important in states that mandate reporting a breast density score to patients as part of their annual mammogram. The latest version of the PowerLook software platform received FDA clearance in August 2018. 
 PowerLook also includes a server platform, which receives patient studies from the imaging modality, performs analysis and sends the results to picture archive and communication systems (PACS) and/or review workstations. As workflow and efficiency are critical in digital imaging environments, PowerLook comes with a powerful and flexible DICOM connectivity solution, which enables universal compatibility with leading PACS and review workstations. iCAD has worked with its OEM partners to ensure optimal integration into the graphical user interface of 
 
5 


  their PACS and review workstations. The algorithms in the product have also been optimized for each digital imaging provider based upon characteristics of their unique detectors. All of these features reduce the need for separate CAD servers and result in lower hardware and service costs for the end-customer. 
 The Company expects additional modules to be released and integrated into the PowerLook platform in the future, and anticipates that all future breast imaging offerings will be built upon the PowerLook platform. 
 Breast Tomosynthesis 
 Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) was introduced in the United States in 2010 by Hologic, Inc., followed by GE Healthcare which received FDA approval for their tomosynthesis system in August 2014. Siemens approval followed in April 2015, and Fuji was approved in early 2017. Tomosynthesis has been demonstrated to have multiple advantages over traditional 2D mammography. It has improved tissue visualization and detection and results in lower recall rates for patients. Tomosynthesis improves the sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis when compared to mammography. Clinical studies indicate that digital breast tomosynthesis improves the ability to distinguish malignant from benign tumors and can detect early signs of cancer hidden by overlapping tissues. This helps reduce the overall number of biopsies performed and the call back rates. Initial studies have indicated that tomosynthesis has the ability to detect 41% more invasive cancers than conventional mammography, and it also reduces false-positives by up to 40%. 
 Artificial intelligence can play an important role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of reading breast tomosynthesis cases by automatically identifying breast masses and micro-calcifications. In 2015, the Company completed development of its cancer detection and workflow solution for DBT to aid radiologists in their review of DBT as a means of improving lesion detection and reducing the time to read the large tomosynthesis datasets. The initial solution is developed for use with GE Healthcares digital breast tomosynthesis for the detection of soft tissue densities (masses, architectural distortions and asymmetries). In January 2017, the Company submitted an amendment to its original PMA application for its 3D tomosynthesis product and the Company received FDA Approval in March of 2017. 
 In early 2018, the Company received CE mark for its multi-vendor, artificial intelligence DBT cancer detection and workflow solution, ProFound AI. The product also received clearance for clinical use in Canada in mid-2018. ProFound AI is a deep learning algorithm that is specifically designed to detect malignant soft-tissue densities and calcifications in DBT exams by analyzing all of the DBT data. Also in early 2018, the Company completed a large multi-reader, multi-case crossover design clinical reader study, which concluded that ProFound AI increases radiologist clinical performance by improving radiologist sensitivity by an average of 8%, improving radiologist specificity by an average of 6.9% and reducing recalls in non-cancer cases by average of 7.2%. The reader study also showed that the product can reduce DBT reading times by an average of 52.7%. Based on these reader study results, ProFound AI received clearance in the US by the FDA in December 2018.

 The Company will continue to focus on advancing the performance of its ProFound AI for DBT solution through training on larger datasets as well as expanding support to other DBT manufactures. The Company is also developing a ProFound AI solution for 2D mammography images for the European market where 2D mammography remains the primary procedure for breast cancer screening. The ProFound AI 2D product is expected to be available in the spring of 2019. 
 ProFound AI 
 ProFound AI is a deep learning algorithm specifically designed to detect malignant soft-tissue densities and calcifications in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). In early 2018, the Company completed a large multi-reader, multi-case crossover design clinical reader study, which found that ProFound AI increased radiologist clinical performance by improving radiologist sensitivity by an average of 8%, improved radiologist specificity by an average of 6.9% and reduced recalls in non-cancer cases by an average of 7.2%. The reader study also showed that ProFound AI reduced DBT reading times by an average of 52.7%. 
 Based on these reader study results, ProFound AI received FDA clearance in December 2018. The product received a CE mark in March 2018, and also received clearance for clinical use in Canada in mid-2018. The Company already has an OEM relationship with GE Healthcares mammography systems, and expects to use ProFound AI to expand its OEM partnerships with other mammography system providers. 
 The Company plans to focus on advancing the performance of ProFound AI by training on larger datasets and expanding support to additional DBT manufacturers. The Company is also developing a ProFound AI solution for two-dimensional mammography images. This solution is targeted at the European market, where two-dimensional mammography remains the primary procedure for breast cancer screening, and is expected to be available in the spring of 2019. 
 In February 2019, iCAD announced its intention to work with researchers from Swedens Karolinska Institute to develop and commercialize an innovative, AI-based breast cancer risk assessment model designed to identify a womans risk of developing an interval cancer which are cancers detected or present within 12 months after a mammographic screening in which findings are considered normal. The model is driven primarily by data from existing mammography images. 
 VeraLook 
 VeraLook is an FDA-cleared CAD solution designed to support detection of colonic polyps in conjunction with CT colonography (CTC). The product is distributed with advanced visualization reading workstations manufactured by Vital Images (a Toshiba Medical System Group company) and Philips Healthcare. It is a natural extension of the Companys core competencies in image analysis and image processing. 
 Field testing of the product was initiated in 2008. Results of the Companys multi-reader clinical study demonstrated that the use of VeraLook improved reader sensitivity by 5.5% for patients with both small and large polyps, and reduced specificity of readers by 2.5%. The clinical relevance of VeraLook was improved reader performance while maintaining high reader specificity.

 VeraLook received FDA clearance in 2010, and market authorization by the National Medical Products Administration in China in 2014. 
 Computed Tomography Applications and Colonic Polyp Detection 
 CT Colonography (CT) is a well-established and widely used imaging technology that is used to image cross-sectional slices of various parts of the human body. When combined, these slices provide detailed volumetric representations of the imaged areas. With recent image quality improvements and greatly increased imaging speeds, CT imaging use has expanded in both the number of procedures performed as well as the applications for which it is utilized. While the increased image quality and number of cross sectional slices per scan provides valuable diagnostic information, it adds to the challenge of managing and interpreting the large volume of data generated. The Company believes that the challenges in CT imaging present it with opportunities to provide automated image analysis and clinical decision support solutions. 
 CTC is a less invasive technique than traditional colonoscopy for imaging the colon. However, the process of reading a CTC exam can be lengthy and tedious as the interpreting physician is often required to traverse the entire length of the colon multiple times. Computer Aided Detection (CAD) technology can play an important role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of reading CTC cases by automatically identifying potential polyps. CAD technology has been developed to aid radiologists in their review of CTC images as a means of improving polyp detection. The Company believes that CAD could become an important adjunct to CTC.Cancer Therapy Segment 
 Background and Overview 
 Radiation therapy is the medical use of ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if the cancer cells are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of curative therapy to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). The clinical goal in radiation oncology is to deliver the highest radiation dose possible directly to the tumor to kill the cancer cells while minimizing radiation exposure to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor in order to limit complications and side effects. Global incidence rates of new cancer cases are rising, primarily due to aging populations and changing lifestyle habits. However, survival rates are also improving as a result of earlier detection and enhanced treatment options. 
 The three main types of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy, or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. EBRT involves a radiation source positioned outside the body, while brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely inside the body in the treatment area, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy uses temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources.

 Conventional EBRT typically involves multiple treatments of a tumor in up to 50 radiation sessions. Brachytherapy offers the benefit of reduced radiation exposure to healthy tissues further away from the radiation source. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any tumor movement within the body during treatment, the radiation source retains its correct position in relation to the tumor. Thus, brachytherapy offers an advantage over EBRT in its ability to better direct high doses of radiation to the size and shape of the cancerous area while sparing healthy tissue and organs. 
 Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for endometrial, cervical, prostate, breast, and skin cancer, and can also be used to treat tumors in many other body sites. Electronic Brachytherapy (eBx) is a type of radiotherapy that utilizes a miniaturized high dose rate X-ray source to apply radiation directly to the cancerous site. 
 Cancer Therapy 
 Products 
 The Xoft® Axxent® Electronic Brachytherapy (eBx®) System® (Xoft System) is a proprietary electronic brachytherapy platform designed to deliver isotope-free (non-radioactive) radiation treatment in virtually any clinical setting without the limitations of radionuclides. The Xoft System utilizes a miniaturized high dose rate, low energy X-ray source to apply radiation directly to the cancerous site. The goal is to direct the radiation dose to the size and shape of the cancerous area while sparing healthy tissue and organs. 
 The Companys Xoft System is a disruptive radiation oncology treatment solution with significant cost, mobility, and treatment time advantages over its competitors or other standards of care. While the primary applications of this system currently are localized breast cancer treatment using a ten to fifteen-minute breast Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) protocol and the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), the Xoft System platform can also be used to treat a wide and growing array of additional cancers, including gynecological and other non-breast IORT clinical indications. 
 The Xoft System delivers clinical dose rates similar to traditional radioactive systems. However, because of the electronic nature of the Xoft technology, the dose fall-off is faster. This lowers the radiation exposure outside of the targeted area, and eliminates the need for a shield treatment environment such as that required with traditional isotope based radiation therapy. Because the Xoft System is relatively small in size, it can easily be transported for use in virtually any clinical setting (including the operating room where IORT is delivered) under radiation oncology supervision. Current customers of the Xoft System include university research and community hospitals, cancer care clinics, veterinary facilities, and dermatology offices that have established strategic partnerships with radiation oncology service providers for supervised treatment delivery. 
 The Xoft System is FDA-cleared, CE marked and licensed in a growing number of countries for the treatment of cancer anywhere in the body, including early-stage breast cancer, non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), and gynecological cancers. In August 2018, the Xoft System received 
 
9 


  regulatory consent from Indias Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), making the Companys full suite of electronic brachytherapy products available to clinicians and patients across India. In 2017, the Companys balloon applicators were cleared by Chinas National Medical Products Administration for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. With NMPA authorization, the complete suite of Xoft System products is now available to clinicians and patients in China. In addition to the Chinese market, the company continues to build positive momentum and has regulatory authorization in key geographies such as Spain, Australia, and Switzerland. 
 The Company continues to make enhancements to the Xoft System controller, including upgrades to the software interface and the high voltage connection. In 2016, the Company unveiled the Streamlined Module for Advanced Radiation Therapy (SMART) platform for the Xoft System, which uses the Axxent Hub cloud-based oncology collaboration software solution. The SMART platform is an adaptive, patient-centric solution to improve workflow efficiency, flexibility, safety and security of a skin eBx program. This comprehensive platform provides all members of the care team with a collaborative environment in which to manage patient workflow, and is Wi-Fi enabled, eliminating challenges related to exchanging current, accurate patient data among providers. 
 The Company offers FDA-cleared applicators for the utilization of the Xoft System, including breast applicators for IORT and Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) in the treatment of breast cancer, vaginal applicators for the treatment of endometrial cancer, cervical applicators for the treatment of cervical cancer, and skin applicators for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers. The flexible single-use breast IORT and APBI applicators are offered in a variety of sizes based on clinical need. The endometrial, cervical and skin applicators are reusable and are manufactured in various sizes based on the anatomical requirements of the patient or the size of the lesion. The Xoft System includes a 50kV isotope-free energy source, a comprehensive service warranty program, and various accessories such as the Axxent eBx Rigid Shield for internal IORT shielding. The 50kV energy source is typically sold under an annual contract and is customized to individual customer volume and usage requirements. 
 The primary applications of the Xoft System involve localized breast cancer treatment using a ten to fifteen-minute breast IORT protocol and the treatment of NMSC. However, the Xoft System can also be used to treat a wide and growing array of additional cancers, including gynecological and other non-breast IORT clinical indications. The Company believes an additional strategic growth opportunity exists in the application of the Xoft System for the treatment of other cancers beyond NMSC and breast cancer in the IORT setting, including integration with minimally invasive surgical techniques and systems. 
 Of the approximately 300,000 women who are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the U.S., the majority, about 180,000 (60%), are diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. Of those with early stage breast cancers, over 100,000 (about 60%) are candidates for treatment with eBx. Currently, a majority of early stage breast cancer patients who are treated with radiation therapy follow a five-to-seven-week daily protocol of traditional external beam radiation, while a small portion are treated with a five-day protocol using brachytherapy. IORT aims to simplify radiation treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients by delivering one precise dose of radiation directly to the lumpectomy cavity in a single, safe and effective procedure. The Xoft System may also be used for APBI, which can be delivered twice daily for five days. 
 
10 


 There are approximately 3.5 million cases of NMSC diagnosed annually in the U.S. Of those cases, approximately 20%-30% have specific diagnoses and lesion characteristics that make such patients potential candidates for electronic brachytherapy treatment. The Xoft System is a viable alternative treatment option for patients with lesions in cosmetically challenging locations (ear, nose, scalp, neck), locations that experience difficulties in healing (lower legs, upper chest, fragile skin), patients on anticoagulants, and patients who are anxious about surgery. The Xoft System has been used to treat more than 10,000 NMSC lesions. Recent clinical data published from 2015 to 2017 demonstrates promising local control and supports eBx as a convenient, effective, nonsurgical treatment option offering minimal toxicity and excellent cosmesis for eligible NMSC patients. On January 4, 2018, the Company adopted a plan to discontinue offering radiation therapy professional services to practices that provide the Companys electronic brachytherapy solution for the treatment of NMSC under the subscription service model within the Therapy Segment. As a result, the Company ceased offering the subscription service model to customers. The Company will continue to offer its capital sales model for both skin cancer treatment and IORT, which provides a brachytherapy system and related source and service agreements The discontinuance of the subscription service model reduced radiation therapy professional services delivery costs, decreased cash burn, and re-focused the Company on the higher margin capital product and service offerings 
 There are approximately 50,000 new cases of endometrial cancer each year in the U.S. and nearly 300,000 new cases worldwide. In 2017, the first-ever European analysis of electronic brachytherapy using the Xoft System for endometrial and cervical cancer treatment was presented at the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) annual meeting. Researchers from Miguel Servet University Hospital in Zaragoza, Spain presented promising study results demonstrating excellent outcomes in acute toxicity in 29 endometrial or cervical cancer patients treated with the Xoft System from September 2015 to September 2016. Additional research showed that compared to an iridium isotope, the Xoft System delivered a lower dose of radiation to surrounding healthy organs at risk, such as the bladder and rectum. 
 Additionally, electronic brachytherapy is appropriate for use in other IORT clinical settings where surgical resection is unable to completely eliminate all cancer cells. In the U.S. and international settings, the Company believes that IORT for prostate, pelvic, gastrointestinal, abdominal, spinal, and soft tissue sarcoma applications remains a potential market given the minimal shielding requirements associated with this treatment modality. Based on these additional clinical applications and the potential to scale the Xoft System in the future to address other indications for use, the Company believes the Xoft System offers unique flexibility and opportunities for growth. 
 Studies 
 In 2016, Melinda Epstein, PhD, et al. of Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, CA published two clinical papers on their experience with the Xoft System for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer with IORT. In June 2016, the Annals of Surgical Oncology published data on 702 patients treated from June 2010 to January 2016, demonstrating a 1.7% recurrence rate. Further, less 
 
11 


  than 5% of patients had significant complications, concluding that IORT safely delivers radiation and allows some women who cannot (or decline to) undergo whole breast radiation to consider breast-conserving therapy rather than mastectomy. In August 2016, The Breast Journal published 20-month mean follow-up data on 146 patients with pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with IORT. The data showed a 2.1% recurrence rate with relatively few complications and again concluded that x-ray based IORT is a promising treatment modality that greatly simplifies the delivery of post-excision radiation therapy. 
 In 2017, researchers from Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian published another clinical paper in the Annals of Surgical Oncology on their experience with the Xoft System in treating 204 early-stage breast cancers in a prospective, X-ray IORT trial from June 2010 to September 2013. With a median follow-up of 50 months, results indicated there have been seven ipsilateral breast tumor events (IBTE), no regional or distant recurrences, and no breast cancer-related deaths. Kaplan-Meier analysis projects that 2.9% of patients will recur locally at 4 years. The sites low complication and recurrence rates support the cautious use and continued study of IORT in selected women with low-risk breast cancer. The Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian IORT series is currently the largest single-facility IORT series with the Xoft System in the United States. 
 Also, in 2017, the Company announced results of a landmark study that showed the benefits of IORT compared to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The analysis demonstrated that IORT could result in direct cost savings for the U.S. healthcare system of more than $630 million over the lifetime of patients diagnosed annually with early-stage breast cancer, as well as significantly benefit patient health by minimizing radiation exposure and offering a better quality of life. The results of the study were published in November 2017 in the peer-reviewed Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation and determined IORT to be the preferred method of treatment. 
 As the Company continues to focus on broadening global awareness and patient access to IORT, 2017 also brought meaningful progress in the area of international research. Physicians from Taiwan published a clinical paper in November 2017 in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal. The multi-center study examined patient selection and the oncologic safety of IORT with the Xoft System for the management of early-stage breast cancer. From 2013-2015, 26 hospitals in Taiwan performed a total of 261 IORT procedures. With a mean follow-up of 15.6 months, locoregional recurrence was observed in 0.8% of patients. The study concluded that preliminary results of IORT in Taiwan showed it is well accepted by patients and clinicians. 
 In 2018, several additional key pieces of clinical evidence supporting IORT with the Xoft System were published. With a mean follow-up of 55 months, outcomes published in The American Journal of Surgery showed that breast cancer recurrence rates of patients who were treated with IORT using the Xoft System and complied with adjuvant medical therapy were comparable to those seen in the cornerstone TARGIT-A study, which evaluated IORT using different technology. The study reviewed results of 184 patients with breast cancer from November 2011 to January 2016 completing Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved IORT protocol. The recurrence rate for the 184 total IORT patients was 5.4 percent at a mean follow-up of 55 months; however, the recurrence rate was significantly lower  2 percent  for the patients who complied with adjuvant medical therapy. The difference in recurrence rates between the 
 
12 


  group complying with versus declining adjuvant medical therapy was statistically significant. To date, this study presents the most long-term research of IORT using the Xoft System published in a peer-reviewed journal. 
 Further in 2018, a long-term study of 1,000 tumors performed at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian and in the Annals of Surgical Oncology showed that IORT is a clinically effective, faster and easier alternative to whole breast radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery for selected low-risk patients at a median follow-up of 36 months. To date, this study presents analysis of the largest series of early-stage breast cancers treated with IORT using the Xoft System published in a peer-reviewed journal. 
 Preliminary results of the Companys ExBRT clinical trial continue to demonstrate that IORT using the Xoft System is safe with excellent local control and cosmesis, and low morbidity. Analysis of the international, multi-center trial was unveiled during an oral presentation at the 60th American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual meeting at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas. In the presentation, A.M. Nisar Syed, MD, Principal Study Investigator, and Medical Director, Radiation Oncology & Endocurietherapy, MemorialCare Cancer Institute, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, and Professor of Radiation Oncology, UCI Medical Center and Harbor-UCLA School of Medicine, detailed clinical techniques and outcomes of IORT using the Xoft System at the time of breast conserving surgery with findings based upon ASTRO suitability criteria. The trial enrolled 1,201 patients between May 2012 and July 2018 at 28 international and United States-based institutions. With a median follow up of two years, less than one percent of patients had cancer regrowth (ipsilateral recurrence) or developed new primary cancers in the other breast. Treatment was well tolerated with grade 3, 4 and 5 adverse events occurring in only 37 patients. Mean treatment time was 10.5 minutes. 
 Since 2016, electronic brachytherapy for the treatment of NMSC has been reimbursed under a skin-specific Category III CPT code. Reimbursement for the treatment delivery is provided through the Category III CPT code, 0394T, which covers high dose rate electronic brachytherapy, skin surface application, per fraction, and includes basic dosimetry, when performed. There are additional Category I CPT codes reportable with the service as determined by physician orders, medical necessity, and documentation. Coverage policies and payment values associated with CPT code 0394T are determined by the regional U.S. Medicare Administrative Contractors. There are several Medicare Administrative Contractors that have published rates for the 0394T code and others that reimburse on a case-by-case basis. 
 In 2017, the Company announced that results of a matched-pair cohort study of 369 early-stage NMSC patients treated with the Xoft System or Mohs micrographic surgery showed that rates of recurrence of cancer were virtually identical at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years. Mohs micrographic surgery is accepted as the most effective technique for removing basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The study results were published online in the peer-reviewed Journal of Contemporary Brachytherapy. 
 The Company supports breast IORT through its ongoing ExBRT Clinical Trial, a post-market clinical trial that enables facilities interested in treating early stage breast cancer patients with the Xoft System to participate in a common clinical protocol and follow enrolled patients for up to 
 
13 


  ten years. The ExBRT study is led by brachytherapy and breast care physicians, including breast surgeons, radiation oncologists, pathologists, and medical physicists from leading U.S. breast cancer care institutions. In February 2018, the study completed enrollment of 1,200 patients at 27 centers in the U.S. and Europe. Clinical results from the ExBRT study are expected to be presented at key medical conferences during 2019.

 As part of its sales and marketing efforts, iCAD engages in a variety of public relations and local outreach programs with numerous customers. We continue to cultivate relationships with industry leaders in breast cancer solutions, including at trade shows where the future of medical image analysis solutions is discussed. 
 Cancer Treatment 
 iCAD markets the Xoft System in the United States and select countries worldwide through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Xoft, Inc. (Xoft). In the United States, Xoft utilizes a direct sales force. Xoft has established partnerships in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom and Ireland, and is actively exploring market entry in South and Central America. 
 A comprehensive medical education program is a key part to the Companys eBx market development strategy. Xoft actively participates in key industry scientific conferences and independent venues in the United States and Europe where we provide professional education programs and product demonstrations relating to eBx. The goal of these programs and demonstrations is to broaden physician awareness of the Xoft System and eBx technology. 
 Competition 
 The Company operates in highly competitive and rapidly changing markets with competitive products available from nationally and internationally recognized companies. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than iCAD and these competitors are well established in the healthcare market. In addition, some companies have developed or may develop technologies or products that could compete with the products the Company manufactures and distributes or that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. Moreover, competitors may achieve patent protection, regulatory approval, or product commercialization before we do, which would limit our ability to compete with them. These and other competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. 
Cancer Detection 
 The Company currently faces direct competition in its cancer detection and breast density assessment businesses from Hologic (Marlborough, MA), Volpara (Rochester, NY), ScreenPoint Medical (Nijmegen, Netherlands, and Densitas (Halifax, NS, Canada). The Company believes that its market leadership in mammography CAD and density assessment and strong relationships with its strategic partners will provide it with a competitive advantage in the mammography CAD and density assessment market.

 The Companys VeraLook product faces competition from the traditional imaging CT equipment manufacturers and emerging CAD companies. Siemens Medical (Tarrytown, NY), GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL), and Philips Medical Systems (Andover, MA) currently offer polyp detection products outside the U.S., and Siemens Medical received FDA clearance for CTC CAD in 2014. The Company expects that CT manufacturers will offer a colonic polyp detection solution as an advanced feature of their image management and display products typically sold with their CT equipment, but current regulatory requirements for the sector present a significant barrier to entry and the Company believes that its market leadership in mammography CAD provides it with a competitive advantage within the CTC community. 
 Cancer Treatment 
 The Companys eBx products face competition in breast IORT primarily from Carl Zeiss Meditec (Zeiss) (Dublin, CA), which has an established base of breast IORT installations in Europe. Zeiss manufactures and sells eBx products for the delivery of IORT, for both breast and additional anatomical areas, including the spine, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and endometrial cancers. IntraOp Medical (Sunnyvale, CA) is another competitor in the high dose rate (HDR) radiation therapy market. 
 The expansion of the Companys gynecological product portfolio and new IORT applications beyond breast IORT have increased the competitive dynamic of the Companys business. Larger and more diversified radiation therapy companies offer a wide variety of clinical solutions for HDR brachytherapy, including Varian Medical Systems (Milpitas, CA) and Elekta (Stockholm, Sweden). These companies offer broad product portfolios, which include a full range of HDR brachytherapy afterloaders and applicators, traditional radiation therapy solutions, treatment planning solutions, and workflow management capabilities. 
 The Companys NMSC products face competition from other mobile non-surgical treatment options (such as Sensus Healthcares (Boca Raton, FL) Surface Radiation Therapy (SRT) system and Elektas Esteya system), surgical treatment options and traditional radiation therapy. 
 Manufacturing and Professional Services 
 The Company manufactures and assembles its CAD products. When a product sale is made to an end-customer by one of the Companys OEM partners, it is usually installed at the customer site by the OEM partner or the Company. When iCAD makes a product sale directly to the end customer, the product is generally installed by iCAD personnel at the customer site. 
 iCADs professional services staff provides comprehensive product support on a pre-sales and post-sales basis. Product support includes pre-sale product demonstrations, product installations, applications training, and technical support. The Companys support center is a single point of contact for the end-customer, and provides remote diagnostics, troubleshooting, training, and service dispatch. Service repair efforts are generally performed at the customer site by third party service organizations or in the Companys repair depot by the Companys repair technicians.

 Xofts portable Xoft System is manufactured and assembled by contract manufacturers. Xofts miniaturized eBx X-ray source is manufactured by the Company at its San Jose, CA facility. Once the product has shipped, it is typically installed by Xoft personnel at the customer site. 
 Xofts professional services staff provides comprehensive product support, physics support, radiation therapists and billing support on a pre-sales and post-sales basis. Field service staff is involved in product installation, maintenance, training and service repair. Customer service staff provides pre-sale product demonstrations, customer support, troubleshooting, service dispatch and call center management. 
 Government Regulation 
 The Companys software and hardware systems and related accessories are regulated as medical devices in all of the jurisdictions where it operates, and its customers are subject to applicable mammography provider quality standards. In the US, the Company must comply with the medical device regulations as amended under the US Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Act governs, among other things, quality standards for product development, testing, labeling, storage, pre-market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of safety. Medical device regulators in other jurisdictions require various levels of clearance, approval, certification, licensure and/or consent before regulated medical devices can be lawfully commercialized in those jurisdictions. Increasingly, medical device manufacturers are adopting globally harmonized quality standards for medical devices as developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and risk management standards for medical devices. Manufacturers of software as a medical device (SaMD) are further subject to specific security standards. There is no guarantee that future products or modifications of current products will meet relevant requirements such as these for lawful commercialization of our products in the jurisdictions where the Company operates. 
 The US FDAs Quality System Regulations require that the Companys operations follow extensive design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures throughout the product lifecycle. The Company is subject to FDA regulations covering labeling and adverse event reporting as well as FDAs general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off-label uses. 
 The Companys manufacturing processes, facilities, and personnel located both within and outside the US are subject to periodic inspections by the US FDA and corresponding state health and safety agencies. The Company must also comply with similar requirements, including site inspections by regulators from other jurisdictions where it operates. Failure to comply fully with applicable 
 
17 


  regulations could cause regulators to take some enforcement action. In the US, for example, enforcement could include delayed marketing clearance or approval, receipt of an FDA 483 deficiency notification at the conclusion of a facility inspection, Warning Letters, product seizures, import/export refusal, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. 
 The U.S. government regulates the transfer of information, commodities, technology and software considered to be strategically important to the United States in the interest of national security, economic and/or foreign policy concerns. A complicated network of federal agencies and inter-related regulations govern exports, and are collectively referred to as Export Controls. In brief, these regulate the shipment or transfer, by whatever means, of controlled items, software, technology, or services out of the United States. 
 The Company is also subject to a variety of federal and state regulations in the US and the regulations in other jurisdictions which broadly relate to our interactions with healthcare practitioners, government officials, purchasing decision makers, and other stakeholders across healthcare systems. These regulations include among others, the following: 
 

 | anti-kickback, false claims, and physician self-referral statutes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | US state laws and regulation regarding fee splitting and other relationships between healthcare providers and non-professional entities, such as companies that provide management and reimbursement support services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Anti-bribery laws, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, (FCPA), the UK Anti-Bribery Act; the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA), and guidances promulgated by respected multi-national groups, such as the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | laws regulating the privacy and security of health data, protected health information and personally identifiable information. These include the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (HITECH), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | healthcare reform laws in the US, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the 21st Century Cures Act include new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to reduce the rate of medical inflation. These include, among other things, stringent new reporting requirements of financial relationships between device manufacturers and physicians and teaching hospitals.

 These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in some cases, still evolving. If our operations are found to violate any of the foreign, federal, state or local laws and regulations which govern our activities, we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions, and applicable penalties associated with the violation, potentially including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in certain payer programs or curtailment of our operations. Compliance obligations under these various laws are oftentimes detailed and onerous, further contributing to the risk that we could be found to be out of compliance with particular requirements. The risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. 
 The FDA, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Department of Justice, states attorneys general and other governmental authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations discussed above. 
 In the United States, medical device companies have been the target of numerous government prosecutions and investigations alleging violations of law, including claims asserting impermissible off-label promotion of medical devices, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state healthcare business, and submission of false claims for government reimbursement. While we make every effort to comply with applicable laws, we cannot rule out the possibility that the government or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and challenge our practices under one or more of these laws. The likelihood of allegations of non-compliance is increased by the fact that under certain federal and state laws applicable to our business, individuals, known as relators, may bring an action alleging violations of such laws, and potentially be awarded a share of any damages or penalties ultimately awarded to the applicable government body. 
 Any action against us alleging a violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements time and attention from the operation of our business. 
 In addition, the laws and regulations impacting or affecting our business may change significantly in the future. Any new laws or regulations may adversely affect our business. A review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities may result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations. Also, the regulatory environment applicable to our business may change in a way that restricts or adversely impacts our operations. 
 We are subject to numerous laws governing safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, among others, both at the US federal and state levels, and similar laws in other jurisdictions. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future, and complying with these laws may result in a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
19 


 Additionally, in order to market and sell our products in certain countries outside of the U.S., we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of each specific country. As noted above, These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, and the time required for regulatory review vary by country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals timely or at all in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products. 
 Federal, state, and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices and management services and software are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business. 
 Reimbursement in the US 
 The federal and state governments of the United States establish guidelines and pay reimbursements to hospitals, free-standing clinics (Independent diagnostic treatment facilities (IDTFs)), and medical professionals for diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures under the federal Medicare program and the joint federal/state Medicaid program. 
 The federal government reviews and adjusts coverage policies and reimbursement levels periodically and also considers various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services in hospitals and free-standing clinics. State government reimbursement for services is determined pursuant to each states Medicaid plan, which is established by state law and regulations, subject to requirements of federal law and regulations. 
 Third-Party Reimbursement 
 Because we expect to receive payment for our products directly from our customers, we do not anticipate relying directly on payment for any of our products from third-party payers, such as Medicare, Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care companies. However, our business will be affected by coverage and payment policies adopted by federal and state governmental authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private payers, which often follow the coverage policies of these public programs. Such policies may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. For example, our business will be indirectly impacted by the ability of a hospital or medical facility to obtain coverage and third-party reimbursement for procedures performed using our products. These third-party payers may deny coverage if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not medically necessary, was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payer, was not used in a manner supported by medical professional society treatment guidelines or third-party reviews of the published, peer reviewed literature, or was used for an unapproved indication. They may also pay an inadequate amount for the procedure which could cause healthcare providers to use a lower cost competitors device or perform a medical procedure without our device. 
 
20 


 Reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payers depend upon a number of factors, including each third-party payers determination that use of a product is: 
 

 | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | cost effective; and
--+--------------------


 | neither experimental nor investigational (i.e., that its use is supported by relevant evidence in the peer reviewed literature.)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many third-party payers use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the U.S. Medicare program, as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. Medicare periodically reviews its reimbursement practices for various products. As a result, there is no certainty as to the future Medicare reimbursement rate for our products. In addition, those third-party payers that do not follow the CMS guidelines may adopt different coverage and reimbursement policies for our current and future products. It is possible that some third-party payers will not offer any coverage for our current or future products. 
 Furthermore, the healthcare industry in the United States is increasingly focused on cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with third-party payers. If third-party payers deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our production costs increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels, we may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 Reimbursement in other jurisdictions 
 Typically, coverage and payment for healthcare products and services in other jurisdictions is determined through a public tender process that takes into consideration the results of a cost-effectiveness or value analysis conducted by a federal government-level technology assessment group, and through reference to coverage and payment policies established for the same or similar product/service in comparable jurisdictions. 
 Market acceptance of our medical products in the U.S. and other countries is dependent upon the purchasing and procurement practices of our customers, patient demand for our products and procedures, and the reimbursement policies of patients medical expenses set by government healthcare programs, private insurers or other healthcare payers. 
 The provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2012 and in subsequent years. We are continuing to evaluate the laws impact on our business. We believe that elements of the program, including the shift to value-based healthcare and increased focus on patient satisfaction will benefit the Company in the future. However, it is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequences these provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs might have on patient access to new technologies. Other elements of this legislation, including comparative effectiveness research, payment system reforms (including shared savings pilots) and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is delivered and paid for in the US, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business, including the demand for and availability of our products, the reimbursement available for our products from 
 
21 


  governmental and third-party payers, and reduced medical procedure volumes. We are evaluating the effect that Trump Administration changes to the Affordable Care Act may have on our business. We cannot predict whether the ACA will be repealed, replaced, or modified or how such repeal, replacement or modification may be timed or structured. As a result, we cannot quantify or predict the effect of such repeal, replacement, or modification might have on our business and results of operations. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The Company primarily relies on a combination of patents, trade secrets and copyright law, third-party and employee confidentiality agreements, and other protective measures to protect its intellectual property rights pertaining to its products and technologies. 
 The Company has certain patents material to its ongoing programs that expire between 2020 and 2029. These patents help the Company maintain a proprietary position in its markets. Additionally, the Company has a number of patent applications pending domestically, some of which have been also filed internationally, and the Company plans to file additional domestic and foreign patent applications when it believes such protection will benefit the Company. These patents and patent applications relate to current and future uses of iCADs cancer detection and digitizer technologies and products, including cancer detection solutions for tomosynthesis, CAD for CT colonography and lung and CAD for MRI breast and prostate, as well as Xofts current and future eBx technologies and products. The Company has also secured a non-exclusive patent license from the National Institute of Health which relates broadly to CAD in colonography, a non-exclusive patent license from Cytyc/Hologic which relates to balloon applicators for breast brachytherapy, and a non-exclusive license from Zeiss which relates to brachytherapy. The Company believes it has all the necessary licenses from third parties for software and other technologies in its products; however, it cannot assure that current or future patent applications will issue with the full scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated. 
 Sources and Availability of Materials 
 The Company depends upon a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for its products, and certain components in its products may be available from a sole or limited number of suppliers. The Companys products are generally either manufactured and assembled by a sole manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers or assembled by it from supplies it obtains from a limited number of suppliers. Critical components required to manufacture these products, whether by outside manufacturers or directly, may be available from a sole or limited number of component suppliers. The Company generally does not have long-term arrangements with any of its manufacturers or suppliers. 
 
22 


 Engineering and Product Development 
 The Company incurred $9.6 million, $9.6 million, and $10.3 million of research and development expense including depreciation and amortization, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Research and development expenses are primarily attributed to personnel, consulting, subcontract, licensing and data collection expenses relating to the Companys new product development and clinical testing. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 97 employees, of whom 95 are full time employees, with 31 involved in sales and marketing, 19 in research and development, 35 in service, manufacturing, technical support and operations functions, and 12 in administrative functions. None of the Companys employees is represented by a labor organization. The Company considers our relations with employees to be good. 
Foreign Regulations 
 International sales of the Companys products are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is an expensive and time-consuming process. The Company cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals timely or at all in any foreign country in which we plan to market its CAD products and the Xoft system, and if we fail to receive and maintain such approvals, our ability to generate revenue may be significantly diminished.
