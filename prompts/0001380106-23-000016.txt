Defining the future of pharmaceutical quality control
We are leading a global transformation toward fully automated microbial quality control within pharmaceutical manufacturing. Our products safeguard the most complex and critical bioprocessing workflows in the industry, enabling faster, safer, and higher capacity drug production. Through our unique expertise at the intersection of microbiology, robotic systems, and advanced vision algorithms, we are setting the foundation for end-to-end quality control automation to enable the future of advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Overview
We are an innovative life sciences technology company providing mission critical automation solutions to facilitate the efficient manufacturing and fast, safe release of healthcare products such as biologics, vaccines, cell and gene therapies, and sterile injectables. Our flagship Growth Direct platform automates and modernizes the antiquated, manual microbial quality control, or MQC, testing workflows used in the largest and most complex pharmaceutical manufacturing operations across the globe. The Growth Direct platform brings the quality control lab to the manufacturing floor, unlocking the power of MQC automation to deliver the faster results, greater accuracy, increased operational efficiency, better compliance with data integrity regulations, and quicker decision making that our customers rely on to ensure safe and consistent supply of important healthcare products.
Our Growth Direct platform is the only fully automated, high-throughput and secure MQC solution. Developed with over 15 years of active feedback from our customers, Growth Direct was purpose-built to meet the MQC challenges posed by the increasing scale, complexity, and regulatory scrutiny confronting global pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our platform delivers the robust and scalable automation necessary to support rapidly expanding demand for novel and complex therapeutic modalities, such as biologics, vaccines, cell and gene therapies, and sterile injectables. Our systems are designed to absorb and automate the vast majority of daily MQC test volume in any pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and can be operated in networked fleets of multiple systems per facility or campus to scale up with high-volume manufacturing.
MQC is a ubiquitous and critical testing process, executed daily at massive scale globally, that ensures pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and products are free of microbial contamination from exogenous microorganisms such as bacteria, mold, and other foreign substances. MQC ensures the safety of final drug products released for patient use, via the constant testing for microbial contamination of raw materials, production environments, personnel, and in-process and final sterility testing for drug products. A single drug production facility may conduct anywhere from tens of thousands to over one million MQC tests per year to ensure product quality. This testing is mandated and closely monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and other global regulatory agencies to ensure the safety of all pharmaceutical products, with serious regulatory and financial consequences for lack of compliance. 
The traditional method of MQC testing, or the traditional method, also known as the compendial method, involves detection of viable, potentially contaminating organisms by a process known as “growth promotion.” In this method, samples are manually collected on media plates, hand labeled and inventoried, physically transported to a centralized lab, and incubated at various temperatures for days to weeks. MQC specialists then visually inspect these plates manually, counting colonies of microbial organisms and recording their counts of thousands of plates by hand, which is a repetitive process predisposed to operator miscounts. In total, the traditional method can require 15 individual processing steps per sample. The benefit of this long-standing method is that it is trusted—a colony growing on media strongly implies the existence of viable, potentially contaminating organisms growing in the location or sample from which the assay was collected.
However, the manual traditional MQC method has become antiquated and is unable to match the growing scale of global pharmaceutical manufacturing—especially complex bioprocessing of biologics, cell, and gene therapies—principally because the process is slow to deliver results, entirely dependent on human labor, subject to technician fallibility and error, unsecured, and non-compliant with data integrity regulations. In time-sensitive, highly regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing operations, these process vulnerabilities can expose organizations to significant operational, financial, and reputational risks, including loss of valuable product batches, reduced manufacturing capacity, lengthy regulatory investigations, costly enforcement actions, and delayed release of life-saving products.
Our Growth Direct platform improves the traditional MQC process, maintaining the fundamental trusted method of growth promotion, but applying advanced robotic automation, powerful optical imaging, algorithmic vision analysis, and data management to render it more scalable and efficient for the future of advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing. Our proprietary technology works by replacing human counting of growing colonies with software and algorithm detection and counting based on image analysis. We exploit the natural autofluorescent properties of microbial organisms to count microcolonies by detecting minute changes to their brightness over time using proprietary vision algorithms, without any new reagents or additional sample prep. Our system wraps this core detection technology with fully automated, high-volume, walk-away robotic sample handling and incubation, locked behind a secured interface that enables compliance with data integrity regulations.
We believe the MQC market is poised for disruption and modernization via the widespread deployment of our Growth Direct platform, and we have embarked on the mission of transforming the MQC test market to standardize on our fully automated solution.
The Growth Direct platform fully automates and digitizes the process of pharmaceutical MQC and enables our customers to perform this critical testing process more efficiently, accurately, and securely. Our platform comprises the Growth Direct system, proprietary consumables, lab information management system, or LIMS, connection software, and comprehensive customer support and validation services. Our Growth Direct system is a fully automated, high throughput instrument for daily processing of MQC samples on our proprietary consumables—a microbiology quality control lab in a box. We have achieved an automated method that is faster and produces more accurate, reliable and accessible data than the traditional method. The Growth Direct platform delivers faster results in half the time, and with its higher testing throughputs and capacity can absorb the vast majority of daily MQC testing in any facility. Our system increases accuracy and efficiency through full automation of the MQC process. Customers depend on Growth Direct’s robust security, connectivity, and data integrity capabilities, reinforced by its high reliability.
We believe we are the first company to solve the existing barriers to MQC automation. Our product platform reflects our expertise at innovating and integrating across multiple technology disciplines, including systems design, robotic handling, microbiology, optical imaging, software image analysis, data management and security, and process automation. Our business was specifically built to meet the needs of pharmaceutical manufacturing and has developed a track record of delivering reliable results for our customers, which is why we believe we are the trusted standard in microbial automation.
We employ direct commercial and service teams that drive the adoption of our products globally. We create a superior user experience from pre-sales, to onboarding, consultative validation services, onsite technical training, and continued customer support throughout our relationship. We have a scalable commercial infrastructure including a direct sales force in North America and Europe. This is supplemented with an extensive and highly specialized customer service and validation infrastructure. This infrastructure ensures successful on-boarding of the Growth Direct through both initial validation and follow-on purchases throughout the entire customer site network, where the highest volume sites may require dozens of Growth Direct systems. We currently have customers across approximately 75 sites in 14 countries and the majority of our customers have multiple Growth Direct systems and have deployed Growth Direct across multiple facility locations.
We launched our current, second generation Growth Direct system in 2017 and have placed 125 systems and sold over 3 million consumables globally. Our customer base includes over half of the top twenty largest pharmaceutical companies as measured by revenue and the manufacturers of 25% of globally approved cell and gene therapies, including approximately 60% of approved gene-modified autologous CAR-T cell therapies. Once installed and validated in our customers’ facilities, Growth Direct provides for recurring revenues through ongoing consumables and service contracts. 
We seek to establish Growth Direct as the trusted global standard in automated MQC by delivering the speed, accuracy, security, and data integrity and regulatory compliance that our customers depend on to ensure patient safety and consistent drug supply.
Industry background and challenges
MQC overview
MQC is the principal method by which pharmaceutical manufacturers ensure the ongoing sterility of their facilities and finished products by detecting and stopping contamination from any outside microorganisms, such as bacteria, mold, and other foreign substances. MQC is a critical component of the bioprocess and pharmaceutical production process and is regulated and mandated by the FDA under current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, and by other international regulatory agencies. Current MQC testing methods are manual, laborious, have lacked innovation over the past several decades.
To guarantee the quality of the end products and the safety of patients who receive them, manufacturers must ensure that their products are free of potentially harmful microbial contamination. This requirement creates a considerable operational challenge, as the natural environment is rife with microorganisms that could pose serious risk to patients should they transit into these clean rooms and contaminate any aspect of the manufacturing process. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies must maintain strict sterility control in their manufacturing facilities by vigilantly monitoring their sites, equipment, and finished drugs, and responding quickly to any microbial contamination. This is accomplished through MQC testing, which generally encompasses four specific applications for testing of microbial contamination:
•Environmental Monitoring (EM)—tests the manufacturing environment, including circulating air, exposed surfaces, and personnel, and represents approximately 65-70% of global MQC test volume;
•Water (W)—tests any purified water used at any stage of the drug production process, including water for injection, or WFI, and represents approximately 15% of global MQC test volume;
•In-Process Bioburden (BB)—tests raw materials, drug substance and in-process product, and represents approximately 15% of global MQC test volume; and
•Sterility Release (ST)—final testing of finished product to ensure sterility before the product is released for commercial sale, and represents less than 5% of global MQC test volume.
MQC testing occurs at high volumes due to its importance across all dimensions of a pharmaceutical manufacturing operation and must be executed daily and implemented across all production lines. As a result, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities may conduct as many as tens of thousands to over one million tests per year.
Legacy MQC techniques and key challenges
The traditional method of MQC testing involves detection of viable organisms by a process known as “growth promotion.” In this process, samples are collected from a manufacturing site (e.g., on equipment, water, raw materials) and deposited by various methods onto plates with a matrix (typically agar) containing growth media with nutrients that encourage microbial growth. These plates are hand-labeled, inventoried, and physically transported to a centralized MQC lab. The plates are incubated under various conditions favorable for microbial growth; a manufacturing operation may simultaneously maintain multiple different incubation conditions and processes. If the original sample is contaminated with microbial organisms, the transferred organisms will divide and expand on the test plate, eventually forming visible colonies on the surface of the growth media. Technicians inspect these plates manually, counting colonies and recording their counts by hand. Visualization of colonies indicates the original presence of viable—that is, living—organisms from the sampled location or substance, and a likely microbial contamination for investigation and remediation.
A typical MQC testing process using the traditional testing method involves 15 or more manual steps per sample, including sample collection, labeling, transport, inventory, incubation, multiple reading and re-incubation steps, final counting, data recording, and data entry. The process is inherently inefficient, with some of the early sample collection steps occurring inside the manufacturing suites spread across a campus, and others centralized in campus MQC labs, requiring sample transport. The manual handling aspect of the traditional method makes it more prone to human error than an automated alternative and can lead to extensive labor and other direct and indirect costs given the thousands to millions of MQC tests required annually per manufacturing facility.
The traditional method poses several operational problems:
•Delayed results — Colonies must grow to a certain size, typically 10 million cells, before the human eye is able to detect them. Across the range of organisms and incubation protocols that facilities handle, this growth time can range from 5-14 days. Until then, no definitive result can be determined, which delays any dependent processes.
•Test subjectivity — Once growth has occurred, a human operator will count the colonies and decide whether the number of colonies meets or exceeds their organization’s threshold for remediation. However, colonies can grow together or overlap completely, or can be mistaken for other artifacts, confounding operators’ ability to generate an accurate, subjective count, especially given the fact that human operators can only check plates a few times during the incubation cycle.
•Vulnerability to errors — Operators must manually categorize, label, track and manage numerous plates through a complex multi-step, multi-day process of incubation and analysis, risking the loss or mishandling of samples. Manual analysis of samples also requires human data collection and entry, introducing risk of mistakes during recording and transcription of data.
•Lack of data integrity and audit controls — The manual, traditional method of data handling faces challenges in meeting the current regulatory standards requiring data integrity. Current processes, which are often paper based, introduce risk of erroneous or fraudulent data as critical data entry points are reliant on the experience, state of mind, and motives of the individual recording them.
•Laborious process — Manual growth promotion is a labor-intensive, multi-step process that requires operators to cycle samples through incubators multiple times per day as they check for growth and often requires physical transport from a manufacturing facility to a centralized lab.
Lapses in traditional MQC processes and potential contamination have resulted in increased regulatory scrutiny and organizational risk, leading to lengthy regulatory investigations and costly enforcement actions in addition to product loss and resulting lost revenue. The risks and costs of inadequate traditional MQC testing include:
•Global data integrity risk — 40-50% of all warning letters issued globally contain a data integrity component.
•Lengthy regulatory investigations — The time to resolution of FDA 483s and warning letters is approximately 6-24 months, and even longer in some cases.
•FDA enforcement action risk — Risk of significant and costly FDA enforcement actions, up to and including consent decrees.
•Significant product loss — Up to $100 million annual product loss per company due to MQC failures has been observed in recent years.
•Shareholder value destruction — Potential shareholder value destruction in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars due to MQC issues, resulting product and financial issues, potential customer concerns, and impact from negative press.
In the last several years alone, there have been numerous publicized incidents involving leading pharmaceutical companies that highlight the risk of poorly controlled, manual MQC testing and protocols, resulting in lengthy site closures, CRLs, and delays to product approvals.
Furthermore, regulatory compliance pressures in the pharmaceutical industry have generally increased over the past decade. More specifically, the proportion of FDA warning letters containing a data integrity complaint has risen in recent years, as the agency devotes greater attention to that topic. We expect there to be continued regulatory scrutiny as the industry shifts to more complex biological manufacturing and manufacturing returns domestically.
Key MQC automation growth drivers
We believe several industry trends are driving the need for MQC automation, including:
•Increasing regulatory scrutiny — Regulatory compliance pressures in the pharmaceutical industry have increased over the past decade, as mentioned above.
•Increasing data integrity scrutiny and need for remote, real-time monitoring of facilities — Facing increased data integrity scrutiny from regulatory authorities in their quality control lab and manufacturing areas, pharmaceutical manufacturers must focus on meeting these regulatory requirements as defined by the FDA and other international regulatory bodies. 
•Expansion of high growth biologics and advent of new, more complex therapeutic modalities such as cell and gene therapies — The global prescription drug market is large and growing, driven in part by the rise in the burden of chronic diseases and the growing demand for innovative therapies such as biologics and cell and gene therapies. Biologics, cell, and gene therapies require complex multi-step manufacturing processes which demand efficient automated MQC processes. 
•Greater efficiency and focus on six sigma lean manufacturing principles — The pharmaceutical industry is under significant pressure to commercialize products faster in order to maximize their patent life. There is continued focus on concepts such as lean manufacturing and six sigma to drive efficiencies in the manufacturing process and a greater emphasis on automating MQC testing to reduce errors and decrease manufacturing lead times and inventory requirements in supply chains. 
•Rebuilding of domestic growth supply chain / increasing scrutiny of outsourced materials with focus on reshoring drug development process — We believe the reshoring of manufacturing operations will further necessitate the need for efficient automated MQC testing.
•Labor shortages — With labor shortages facing many companies in the global pharmaceutical industry, we believe that automated MQC processes can not only make their manufacturing processes more efficient and cost-effective but also help mitigate worker scarcity.
Market opportunity
Our core market of MQC testing encompasses a ubiquitous and high-volume testing process deployed across all pharmaceutical manufacturing operations. 
Our core total addressable market
We are especially focused on serving the high-growth biologics, cell, and gene therapy markets, which have the highest MQC testing intensity per batch of manufactured product. We seek to drive substantial growth by establishing Growth Direct as the standard for MQC automation in advanced bioprocessing for biologics, cell, and gene therapies. 
The Growth Direct platform
Our proprietary Growth Direct platform fully automates and digitizes the trusted growth-based method of MQC and enables customers to perform this critical testing process more efficiently, accurately, and securely. Our platform comprises the Growth Direct system, proprietary consumables, LIMS connection software, and comprehensive customer support and validation services. The platform’s suite of products reflects our expertise at innovating and integrating across multiple technology disciplines, including systems design, robotic handling, microbiology, optical imaging, image analysis, data management and security, and process automation, and is supported by our unwavering commitment to the highest level of customer support.
Our technology
To date, prior technology products have not succeeded in automating MQC workflow at scale, due to a combination of insufficient platform throughput, lack of full automation, and non-viable technology approaches. Most testing solutions on the market that seek to replace the traditional method diverge from directly measuring microbial growth, using alternative analytical technologies that often require additional reagent preparation and that do not deliver the same results as the existing traditional method. These methods are difficult to validate relative to the traditional method and have therefore seen low adoption across the industry.
Growth Direct method
The Growth Direct method relies on a fundamental property of all microorganisms—they contain cellular components required for growth, called flavins and flavoproteins, that autofluoresce, or glow, without the addition of reagents under certain frequencies of light. Our proprietary system detects microcolonies of microorganisms by illuminating them with blue-spectrum light and directing the resulting green-spectrum signal onto a Charged-Coupled Device, or CCD, chip—an array of independent photosensitive pixel elements. Our image analysis software interprets these light signals and counts the clusters of illuminated pixels representing each microcolony. The end result is an automated method that is faster and produces more reliable and accessible data than the traditional method. Our Growth Direct platform accelerates time to results by several days, a 50% improvement over the traditional method, and reduces MQC testing to a simple two-step workflow, eliminating up to 85% of the manual steps of traditional MQC, generating significant time, operational, and cost savings for our customers.
Core detection technology
Our system illuminates samples using an array of high-intensity blue LED lights, which causes microcolonies to autofluoresce without destroying them. All microbial cells autofluoresce in the green-spectrum when illuminated with blue LED light. A CCD chip captures images with illuminated pixels wherever autofluorescence from microbial cells is detected. Our software detects and registers the clusters of illuminated pixels that represent underlying microcolonies. The system generates a time series of images as the sample incubates and is imaged every four hours. Finally, vision analysis software continuously evaluates the time series for evidence of growing colonies, represented by increasing signal intensity and size of illuminated groups of pixels.
A key feature of detection via imaging of autofluorescence is that this approach does not harm cells, and as such is a non-destructive method. This provides several benefits, including ensuring that detected colonies represent actual viable microbial contaminations, and permitting detected microcolonies to grow into visible colonies for use in subsequent microbial identification for root cause investigation follow-up.
Our platform can detect microorganism growth at the microcolony stage at approximately 100 cells, which typically occurs in half the time required for visual plate counting to detect visible colonies by eye at approximately 10 million cells.
System components and workflow
The Growth Direct system comprises two automated and temperature-controlled incubators, robotic sample transport systems, an advanced imaging system, two servers (one for system control, the other for image analysis) and associated hardware and staging required for the handling of up to 700 of our consumables.
The overall workflow of the automated Growth Direct method mirrors the traditional visual plate counting assays, allowing for operator familiarity of use, ease of integration into existing MQC protocols, and a streamlined regulatory validation process.
Growth Direct system components
The Growth Direct workflow begins when microbial organisms are collected on proprietary growth media plates using the same collection methods as the traditional method—via direct contact, air settling or air filtration for environmental monitoring testing, or via funnel filtration of liquid samples onto the membrane of the consumable for water or bioburden testing. For ease of use, our consumables are compatible with existing hardware, such as active air samplers or liquid filtration systems, and are supplied by us with identical nutrient agar media as traditional media plates.
A Growth Direct operator loads the system in bulk using two carriers designed to hold up to 60 of our consumables each. A key benefit of the Growth Direct is that the system can be placed directly in a production area, compared to the traditional method which often requires transporting samples to a centralized lab for testing. Our consumables are pre-labeled with unique bar codes for forensic trail identification, management and to enable data integrity compliance. Every consumable bar code contains a unique serial number that allows traceable information to be captured by two bar code scanners on the Growth Direct system. That allows metadata such as sample location, time, type, test protocol, and operator to be captured and associated with each consumable result. Intake sensors within the system automatically read, identify, and catalog the bar-coded samples, after which the samples are transferred from the loading queue to one of two independently controlled incubators, which together have a capacity of 700 of our consumables, and which support the operation of multiple custom incubation protocols. Once loaded into the system, consumables cannot be removed or tampered without generating an auditable record of actions by an operator.
During the incubation phase, the Growth Direct captures images of each consumable at intervals of four hours. To perform the imaging, the system transfers consumables from the incubator to the imaging chamber, illuminates them using a blue-spectrum light and captures autofluorescence signals in a high-resolution image using the CCD camera. Samples are returned to the incubators to continue their incubation protocols. Automated sample handling means no sample is ever missed for testing or replaced into the wrong incubator or accidentally discarded.
Over the course of the incubation protocol, the system’s image analysis software uses proprietary algorithms to analyze the behavior of autofluorescent objects over an accumulating time series of images, enabling the Growth Direct to identify and count growing microcolonies and distinguish them from non-living debris.
After the image analysis is complete, the system reports the number of growing colonies found on the surface of the consumable. The result data can be printed or transmitted to LIMS via our LIMS connection software for storage and user review. When a sample demonstrates growth that exceeds the threshold for contamination set by the organization, automatic email alerts notify quality personnel of a possible contamination before the end of the incubation period. A powerful yet intuitive user interface allows the operator to track the consumables in the system throughout the testing process and monitor the results in real time, which offers a significant advantage to the manual and traditional method that has to wait to the end of the incubation before counting. After results are reviewed, the consumable can either be unloaded to a carrier for further microbiological identification or automatically discarded as waste at the operator’s discretion.
Validation framework
We have demonstrated the accuracy, speed, and reliability of detecting microcolonies using the Growth Direct’s automated image analysis compared to conventional methods through numerous scientific studies.
Accuracy. The Growth Direct is highly accurate when compared to traditional methods. Studies of the Growth Direct comparing its vision-based detection and enumeration of colonies against the MQC gold-standard USP <61> benchmark reference set of micro-organisms demonstrate that the Growth Direct delivers the same results or better as traditional, manual verification of colonies.
The figure below demonstrates the accuracy of the Growth Direct imaging and analysis technology compared to a reference count produced by an analyst interpreting the image data created by the software. A wide range of organism types—both mandated by the United States Pharmacopeia, or USP, and those commonly found in pharmaceutical facilities—were evaluated.
Growth Direct colony count accuracy vs. standard reference
Speed. The Growth Direct is faster than the traditional method. Across a range of organisms of interest, the Growth Direct detects colonies in half the time or faster.
The figure below shows the time to detection, or TTD, and time to result, or TTR, in hours for a wide range of pharma lab-relevant microorganisms using the Environmental Modeling, or EM, application on the Growth Direct system compared to the time to detection / time to result window using traditional manual tests (72+ hours).
Growth Direct time to result vs. traditional method
Our value proposition by stakeholder is described below:
Reliability. The Growth Direct is more reliable than the traditional method for accuracy of organism enumeration. In studies of environmental monitoring plates incubated for five days, which compared Growth Direct’s vision-based detection and enumeration to visual counting conducted by technicians, the Growth Direct regularly identified and counted colonies that technicians missed, as shown by the counts in the shaded area in the figure below.
Growth Direct colony detection reliability vs. traditional method
Our Growth Direct platform
We pioneered the Growth Direct platform—a combination of our novel Growth Direct system, proprietary consumables, LIMS connection software, and comprehensive customer support and validation services—to fully automate and digitize the process of MQC in the sterile manufacturing of important health care products.
The Growth Direct system
Our current, second-generation Growth Direct system, launched in 2017, reflects our deep experience with delivering automation to the MQC market. The Growth Direct system is a fully automated, high throughput system for processing MQC samples—a microbiology quality control lab in a box. The Growth Direct system contains two high-capacity incubators, an advanced imaging system and internal robotics for sample handling. The system enables walk-away bulk sample loading, holding 700 of our consumables per system. Its dual, independently controlled incubators automatically manage multi-temperature incubation protocols. Onboard imaging and vision software detects and counts microbial growth, delivering test results in half the time of the manual method. The system’s compact 57” x 39” x 95” size delivers these benefits in a footprint that allows customers to place the Growth Direct system directly in manufacturing suites of various sizes compared to the traditional method, where samples are often required to be transferred to a centralized lab. Co-location in manufacturing minimizes delays to incubation and errors introduced by sample transfer to the quality control lab. The Growth Direct system brings the lab to the manufacturing floor, for automated MQC testing, anywhere in the facility or manufacturing campus.
Proprietary consumables
We offer two proprietary consumables plates to capture test samples for analysis on the Growth Direct: (1) an Environmental Monitoring, or EM, consumable and (2) a Water / Bioburden, or W/BB, consumable. Both types are custom-designed proprietary consumables with specific mechanical and optical features to facilitate automated handling and image processing within our Growth Direct system and have bar codes for tracking and data integrity. Two bar codes are used—one applied during our manufacturing process to define the media type and expiration dates, and a second that is generated by the Growth Direct system at time of testing that defines the sample ID and LIMS number. The consumables incorporate multiple standard media for each application as both products are based on the traditional growth method.
In addition, we are developing a growth-based rapid automated sterility test for use on the Growth Direct system. Rapid sterility tests are utilized for final release testing in any facility that manufactures sterile products such as biologics and sterile injectables, as a final quality check before shipment. The traditional sterility test utilizes a growth method that requires at least 14 days to deliver final results, during which time dependent manufacturing steps are paused or proceed at risk, or final products are held in inventory. Similarly, autologous cell therapies require collection of patient tissue, ex vivo manipulation of these cells, and delivery via reinjection into patients — all steps which must be conducted within approximately two weeks, which the traditional method of sterility testing exceeds, causing delays or requiring release of the product at risk.
 We began beta testing of our rapid sterility test with one of our existing global customers in 2022. When commercialized, we expect our rapid sterility test will reduce the traditional method’s 14-day time to results by at least 50%, permitting faster final release, with the goal of speeding critical drugs and vaccines to market. When released, we expect our rapid sterility test will also deliver the other benefits of the Growth Direct platform, including increased efficiency, reduced risk of errors, and enabling data integrity compliance. Our development program was supported by contract funding from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research & Development Authority, or BARDA, which is supporting the development of improvements in vaccine production methods that accelerate the availability of vaccines against viruses with pandemic potential.
Growth Direct LIMS connection software
Our Growth Direct software allows for two-way integration to LIMS, enabling a fully paperless workflow. The bi-directional LIMS connection uses the widely supported comma-separated values, or CSV, file format to communicate, delivering compatibility with all existing LIMS. The connection supports the use of LIMS for Growth Direct created barcodes that are applied to our consumables. After sampling, the consumables are loaded into the Growth Direct system, which performs the incubation, detection and enumeration of colonies. Final results are automatically uploaded to the LIMS. This eliminates the risk of human error that could arise from manually entering the results, while improving efficiency. Moreover, the LIMS connection eliminates the need to use paper in the lab and delivers information to stakeholders in a secure manner, designed to enable compliance with data integrity regulations.
Our service team works directly with customers’ IT teams to help integrate Growth Direct software into their LIMS for seamless connectivity.
Validation services
As part of our customer support experience, we offer full validation support to ensure customer success with the Growth Direct platform. This offering helps our customers validate their Growth Direct system for full routine use faster, typically in just three to nine months, and develops confidence in the operation of our platform.

•Deep integration into heavily regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing processes — Our products are entrenched within our customers’ workflow and the majority of our customers have purchased multiple systems and at multiple locations. For every drug product manufactured or in development, our customers are required to establish a validated QC process that they can execute consistently and reliably. Customers 
typically dismantle manual testing infrastructure after switching to our platform, creating enormous switching costs that get amplified by the network effect of linked systems and data aggregation across customer sites. Since initial installation, our relentless focus on providing robust validation support ensures assimilation of our platform into our customers’ standard operating procedures, further contributing to customer captivity. We believe that our first mover advantage has further enabled us to become deeply rooted within our customer’s facilities and provide for ongoing opportunity with our existing customer base.
•Our highly attractive business model that leverages our growing installed base of systems to generate persistent recurring revenues through consumables and service contracts — Once embedded and validated in our customers’ facilities, our Growth Direct provides for recurring revenues through ongoing consumables and service contracts. When our customers invest in our technology, they commit to a long-term use of our products. Our customers regularly purchase our proprietary consumables to perform MQC testing and maintain their systems via annual service contracts. Our products are used daily in our customer’s facilities and their key workflows, reinforced by regulatory requirements that are driving the industry towards further automation. Once validated, additional systems can be deployed to absorb the majority of test volume in a facility. Moreover, once a Growth Direct system is installed within a customer’s facility, it provides for an opportunity to place additional systems in existing and new facilities, which can be installed and validated in a faster, more efficient manner given the comprehensive validation process for the initial system.
•Ability to leverage our extensive regulatory expertise to better serve our customers’ needs — We believe we are a thought-leader with respect to regulatory requirements. We have a long history engaging with the major regulatory bodies in our industry, such as the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, some of whom are also our customers. Our regulatory strategy has benefited our business in several ways, including: 1) by achieving the definition of the Growth Direct Technology as an “automated compendial validation” in key trade group and regulatory issuances, such as the Parenteral Drug Association, or PDA, Technical Report 33, and USP chapter <1223>; 2) by working with industry and regulatory forums to define a fast validation strategy that allows a short timeline routine testing implementation; 3) and by helping our customers obtain regulatory acceptance from the EMA and the FDA for the use of our technology and validation strategy for new drug applications with the Bioburden application (environmental modeling and water do not need regulatory license change). Our technology has also been audited regularly by regulatory inspectors as part of routine audits of customer sites, with no citations received to date. We have also succeeded in securing a substantial long-term government contract from BARDA to support development of new products as part of an ongoing partnership concerning areas of shared strategic interest regarding accelerated pandemic vaccine release.
•Our experienced management team and workforce with deep domain knowledge — Our management team combines strong subject matter expertise with a demonstrated history of commercial and operational execution. Moreover, our workforce has deep domain knowledge across a range of healthcare, technology and business disciplines, which we believe drives our continued commercial success. We have supplemented our diverse technical experience by assembling an operational team with expertise in manufacturing, legal, sales, marketing, customer service and finance. We believe this confluence of talent from multiple disciplines allows us to stay ahead of our competitors by identifying highly impactful opportunities and building products and solutions that address these opportunities.
Our growth strategy
We aim to position the Growth Direct platform as the industry standard for automated MQC testing. We believe we can achieve this through the following key growth strategies.
Reorganize to achieve growth and profitability — In August 2022, our management team endeavored to reorganize the company into a leaner, lower cost organization focused on a path to growth and profitability. As of December 31, 2022, we reduced our workforce by approximately 20%, including employees, contractors and temporary employees, in connection with an organizational restructuring plan. We will continue to invest in key growth initiatives including enhancing commercial execution and key product development programs that are expected to drive future revenue growth. 
Leverage our first-mover advantage and our industry leadership to cement Growth Direct as the new standard of MQC automation in the rapidly growing bioprocessing market, including biologics, cell, and gene therapy manufacturing — Our MQC process automation platform is particularly well-suited to the manufacturing of biologics, 
cell, and gene therapies. These products are manufactured in a highly modularized fashion where each manufacturing batch often represents an individual dose to a specific patient. These therapies are therefore exceedingly valuable, and the manufacturing methods to produce them are time-sensitive and exposed to outsized risk of contamination given the amount of material handling and process change-over. We have demonstrated the value of our platform in cell and gene therapy manufacturing with our early success in converting customers in this segment. Furthermore, companies in this space are developing new approaches to manufacture these complex products, including novel facility layouts, new processes and workflows, and new quality and risk management frameworks. We intend to capitalize on our first-mover advantage to define the standard of MQC automation in this growing market by moving upstream in the cell and gene therapy manufacturing design practice, creating thought leadership on MQC automation in cell and gene therapy manufacturing, partnering with facility design firms who specialize in manufacturing infrastructure for these modalities, and targeting CDMOs, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and contract research organizations, or CROs, with significant exposure to this segment.
Drive new customer adoption of the Growth Direct platform by converting the leading manufacturers in our core markets, including but not limited to top 50 pharmaceutical companies and leading CDMOs — With the launch of our latest generation Growth Direct in 2017, approximately 40 global customers have adopted the Growth Direct platform to automate MQC testing in over 75 manufacturing facilities. We intend to drive global adoption by broadly seeking new customers in our core pharmaceutical manufacturing end markets. Our initial focus is on influential high-volume top 50 pharmaceutical companies as measured by revenue and global contract manufacturing organizations, which provide manufacturing services directly to pharmaceutical companies. Our existing customer base includes over 50% of the top twenty global pharmaceutical companies by revenue. Our target geographies include North America and Europe and we are expanding our direct and indirect sales teams to access new customers in other geographic territories, such as Asia.
Expand implementation of the Growth Direct platform within our existing customer base by deploying additional systems across their global manufacturing site network and driving increased application utilization and consumable pull through on a system-by-system basis — We pursue a land-and-expand strategy to drive broad global adoption of our systems. Our approach begins by placing initial systems within our customers’ global manufacturing network. The majority of our customers, which comprise over 50% of the top twenty global pharmaceutical companies as measured by revenue, have global operations with multiple manufacturing facilities. We guide these initial sites as they gain experience with the Growth Direct, assisting their validation of initial applications, proving the value of our systems, and establishing a relationship as a trusted and reliable vendor. Our system is specifically designed to absorb the daily MQC testing volume at our customer’s facilities. We then successfully sell additional systems to support additional suites at existing sites as well as leverage our high customer satisfaction at existing facilities to drive adoption at new sites within our customers’ global manufacturing network. The majority of our customers have multiple Growth Direct systems per site and across different facility locations. We accomplish this expansion via direct peer-to-peer selling facilitated by our commercial team, and by partnering with executive decision makers to execute global customer rollout agreements. We simultaneously drive increased utilization on a system-by-system basis by providing our customers our full suite of applications that can be validated and used on the Growth Direct platform. Moreover, our customers’ strong desire to globally standardize and harmonize their MQC operations provides us a direct opportunity to grow with them, and after validating their first system we are able to install and validate more systems globally for them in a much faster time period given the initial validation process.
Increase the value of our platform by innovating and launching new applications, hardware, and software products that deliver the power of integrated automation across our customers’ QC workflows — We believe the depth, scalability and robust capabilities of our Growth Direct platform allow us to address key challenges facing MQC testing in the pharmaceutical industry. As an innovative leader in automatic MQC testing, we intend to invest in further enhancements in our existing platform as well as end-to-end workflow solutions in our core market. We have a well-defined roadmap for our existing products, which includes new consumables to expand our platform’s MQC testing applications, such as in sterility testing; improvements to on-board algorithms that enable greater insight from our image analysis, such as our RMBNucleus™ Mold Alarm software; additional imaging modalities to unlock new testing functionality; additional system formats to accommodate new customer use cases; and new software to enable fleet management and analytics. Our product roadmap also includes new products to automate upstream and downstream workflow elements, such as microbial identification and automated sample collection, and data-rich products including data management, fleet integration, and predictive analytics. By expanding and continuously enhancing the Growth Direct platform, we believe we can drive incremental revenue from existing clients as well as broaden the appeal of our solutions to potential new customers.
Pursue opportunistic strategic investments, partnerships, and acquisitions — Our strong growth to date has been entirely organic as we continue to add customers to our growing install base of Growth Direct users, while also expanding 
our consumables and product offering to those customers. At the appropriate stage we may consider opportunistic investments, partnerships, and acquisitions which may strengthen our product platform, allow us to enter new markets, and enhance our growth profile.
Commercial
We launched the latest generation of the Growth Direct platform in 2017, which includes the Growth Direct system and consumables for three applications: environmental monitoring, water, and bioburden testing. Our principal commercial strategy since launch has been to focus on converting customers among the top fifty global pharmaceutical companies. Our land-and-expand approach concentrates on placing initial systems at leading pharmaceutical manufacturers, validating our products, driving high customer satisfaction, and then expanding throughout our customer’s network of sites with more systems and applications. We have simultaneously and opportunistically pursued other important customer types outside of top fifty global pharmaceutical companies, such as CDMOs, CMOs, CROs, vaccine manufacturers, pharmacy compounders (503Bs), among others.
With this approach, we have substantially grown our customer base to approximately 35 global customers and have placed 125 systems and sold over 3 million consumables globally. We have customers across approximately 75 sites in 14 countries and the majority of our customers have multiple Growth Direct systems per site and across different facility locations. Our customer base includes manufacturers of biologics, including cell and gene therapies, sterile injectables, small molecule pharmaceutical manufacturers, and CDMOs, among others. We have sold to over half of the top twenty global pharmaceutical companies as measured by revenue. Moreover, we serve customers who operate some of the most complex manufacturing modalities in the world; for example, we support the manufacturers of 25% of globally approved cell and gene therapies, including over 60% of approved gene-modified autologous CAR-T cell therapies. Many of our customers purchase multiple Growth Direct systems at the same time and we expect them to use these systems for many years before needing to purchase new systems. As a result, a significant portion of our annual sales currently comes from the purchase of our Growth Direct system by a small number of different customers each year. We are working to expand our new customer base and sales within existing customers’ organizations to provide a steady stream of sales of our systems and to grow our recurring sales stream from consumables and service contracts.
We have a global commercial team that includes direct sales, commercial operations, validation, field services, strategic marketing, marketing communications and product management. This staff is primarily located in North America and Europe, and we also maintain direct customer support teams providing both validation and field service capabilities in the same territories. We intend to expand our sales, support, and marketing efforts in the future by expanding our direct footprint in North America and Europe as well as developing a comprehensive distribution and support network in Asia where new market opportunities exist.
We increase awareness of our products among our target customers through direct sales calls, trade shows, seminars, academic conferences, web presence, social media and other forms of internet marketing. We supplement these traditional marketing efforts by fostering an active community of users of our products through user groups, customer advisory board meetings, forums and blogs with internally generated and user-generated content.
We employ a high-touch, customer-centric commercial approach focused on maximizing customer success. After a system sale is closed, our team works closely with customers to install systems and provide on-site validation and training support. We focus on supporting our customer’s transition to an automated MQC protocol and aim to ensure customer success in routine use. We maintain high customer satisfaction through a robust service and maintenance offering, including an online phone and help desk, remote support and on-site field service.
Manufacturing and supply
Our primary manufacturing facility is located in our headquarters in Lowell, Massachusetts. The facility has over 52,000 square feet, with 20,000 square feet of manufacturing floor space that houses multiple manufacturing spaces and functions, including assembly of Growth Direct systems, an ISO-8 cleanroom with ISO-5 laminar flow hoods for consumable manufacturing, dedicated areas for media preparation. The facility has robust quality control from materials receiving to product distribution. We are working to complete a back-up manufacturing facility for consumables in Lexington, Massachusetts, which we expect to be completed in the first half of 2023.
We believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our near-term growth targets for both systems and consumables. Our consumables manufacturing operation, in particular, is designed to meet the demands of high-volume media supply necessary to serve our market. It is centered around a state-of-the-art automated production line that we 
believe has enough capacity to support near and medium-term growth. To support continuous supply for our customers, we have manufacturing redundancies and maintain inventory in multiple locations, including our Lowell headquarters, a second redundant storage location in the metropolitan Boston area, and at our third-party logistics, or 3PL, warehouses in Schiphol, Netherlands and Frankfurt, Germany. 
Our manufacturing strategy includes direct manufacturing of certain products, and third-party outsourcing for certain components and subassemblies. We obtain components and subassemblies for our Growth Direct systems from multiple third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers. While some of these components are sourced from a single supplier, we have qualified second sources for several of our critical parts. We believe that having dual sources for our critical components helps reduce the risk of a production delay caused by a disruption in the supply of a critical component. We perform final assembly, commissioning, and inspection of the systems in our Lowell facility before shipping to customers. Our consumable plate assemblies and lids are manufactured to our specifications by manufacturing partners. We procure media from third-party suppliers and fill and assemble the final consumables in our Lowell facility. We contract with third party vendors to sterilize our consumables before shipping to customers.
We continue to invest in our manufacturing capabilities to increase capacity ahead of future growth, to ensure continuity of supply, and to make order fulfillment consistent and convenient for our customers. Our future manufacturing plans may include expansion of our existing facilities, additional global sites, additional automation lines, and further manufacturing redundancy plans. We are continually evaluating our supply chain and may proactively optimize certain aspects of our manufacturing and supply chain footprint to meet our business objectives.
License agreement
License agreement with Thermo Fisher
In May 2013, we entered into a patent license agreement, or the Thermo Fisher license agreement, with Thermo CRS, Ltd., or Thermo Fisher, pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, non-sublicensable license under Thermo Fisher’s patent rights relating to robotic devices. Pursuant to the Thermo Fisher license agreement, we paid Thermo Fisher one-time fees in the aggregate of $125,000 and are also obligated to pay royalties at a fixed dollar amount ranging from the low to mid four figures for our sale of each system containing the licensed products, subject to increase or decrease upon certain events. The Thermo Fisher license agreement will remain in effect until the last to expire of the licensed patent rights.
Intellectual property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technology, including by seeking and maintaining patent protection, protecting our trade secrets and other proprietary information, obtaining and maintaining our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, and continually evaluating third-party technologies for further licensing opportunities. We also seek trademark protection where appropriate to protect the names that identify us as the source of our products and services.
We own certain patents, patent applications and intellectual property and license certain patents and other intellectual property from third parties. We have also entered into certain supply and commercial agreements with various vendors and suppliers under which we receive rights to their intellectual property for use in our products. Our material license agreement with Thermo Fisher is described in more detail above.
As of December 31, 2022, we own eight granted unexpired patents in the United States, forty issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, countries in Europe, India, Japan and Mexico, and ten pending patent applications in the United States. Our issued patents and pending patent applications cover our technologies and products, including machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, and methods of use with respect thereto, related to the Growth Direct platform. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we license three issued patents in the United States, Canada and Europe from Thermo Fisher relating to a robotic carousel workstation. The issued patents that we own or that we in-license from Thermo Fisher and any patents that may issue from pending applications that we own have expiration dates or, in the case of patent applications, projected statutory expiration dates, between 2023 and 2042, excluding, with respect to patents that may be issued from our patent applications, any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, if applicable.
Competition
As a life sciences technology company, we face competition from a wide array of companies in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. This competition includes both small companies and large companies with greater financial and technical resources and longer operating histories than our own.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified engineering, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they establish collaborative arrangements with large companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of the products that we develop are likely to be the continued growth of our market position, our ability to expand our integration with existing customers, our ability to develop new products and improve our existing products, and our ability to grow our sales and marketing capabilities. Our commercial opportunity for any of our products could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, are more convenient, or are less expensive than our products, or if they are able to more effectively integrate their systems with customers before we do.
We primarily compete with established manufacturers of traditional MQC testing products, such as petri dishes, incubators, and other manual testing equipment, which our products aim to displace. These companies include bioMerieux, Becton Dickinson, Charles River Labs, Merck Millipore and Thermo Fisher. We also compete with a limited number of companies that have or are attempting to enter the MQC testing market with alternative automated solutions, such as Interscience, which has developed a partially-automated system for MQC testing. There are also several established companies in the bioprocessing technology market with whom we do not currently compete, but that could develop products that will compete with us in the future. Many of the established companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development teams or more established marketing and sales and commercial teams.
Seasonality
Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter as a result of factors such as our customers’ budgetary cycles and extended summer vacation periods that can impact our ability to deliver products and provide onsite services to our customers during those periods. We expect this volatility to continue for the foreseeable future, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results and financial metrics. In addition, trends may vary in the future as our revenue mix shifts from non-recurring to recurring revenues.
Government regulation
We provide products and services used for quality-control testing in pharmaceutical product and medical device manufacturing. Although our Growth Direct platform is not directly subject to regulation by the FDA, our customers’ products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, many of our customers’ products are regulated as either medical devices or drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, or as biological products under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations, each as amended and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices, drugs and biological products to ensure that such products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the applicable requirements of the FDCA and the PHSA. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity.
The manufacture of our Growth Direct system and our consumables is subject to compliance with regulatory systems, standards, guidance and other requirements, as appropriate, including, but not limited to, laws and regulations for safe working conditions and certifications from the International Organization for Standardization. Our products are also subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and recommendations, relating to the safe and proper use, 
transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, U.S. and international import and export laws and regulations, including those enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury and OFAC, require us to abide by certain standards relating to the cross-border transit of finished goods, raw materials and supplies and the handling of related information. Our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, and the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies. We are also subject to various other laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws as well as laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records. We also contract and may in the future contract with the U.S. government. As such, we are subject to certain laws and regulations applicable to companies doing business with the government, as well as with those concerning government contracts, including being subject to potential investigation for compliance with government contract regulations.
