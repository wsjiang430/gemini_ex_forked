ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Vectrus, Inc. (Vectrus, the Company, our company, we, us or our) is a leading provider of services to the United States (U.S.) government worldwide. Leveraging a history of more than 70 years, we provide global service solutions in 129 locations and 22 countries across three continents in both stable and unstable political and economic environments. We believe that a primary strength of our company is our expeditionary nature that is grounded in our ability to recruit U.S. and international personnel with appropriate expertise, as well as navigate the logistical, legal, and other challenges of operating in multiple, challenging overseas locations. We have a proven history of deploying resources rapidly and with precision to support the mission success of our customers. 
 We operate our business based on three core values of Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. We operate as one segment and offer facility and logistics services and information technology and network communications services. 
Our primary customer is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), with a high concentration in the U.S. Army. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had total revenue of $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, all of which was derived from U.S. government customers. 
We employ approximately 6,700 people, including approximately 700 employees who joined our company following our acquisition of SENTEL Corporation (SENTEL) in January 2018, and engage approximately 6,500 subcontractor personnel around the world. This includes an experienced management team with an average of 27 years of experience in the military, defense industry, and a wide range of U.S. government agencies. Our management team has experience winning new contracts, driving premier operating efficiency, and managing all aspects of the demanding compliance culture required to do business with the U.S. government worldwide. We are also a leading employer of veterans with more than 35% of our employees voluntarily reporting a military background, and we have been recognized numerous times in recent years by veteran-focused organizations as a military-friendly employer. 
Vectrus was incorporated as an Indiana corporation in February 2014. In September 2014, Exelis Inc. (Exelis) completed the spin-off (the Spin-off) of Vectrus. Prior to the Spin-off, we were a subsidiary of Exelis that constituted Exelis' Mission Systems business, which was part of Exelis' Information and Technical Services segment. As a result of the Spin-off, Vectrus became an independent, publicly traded company. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to Exelis or "Former Parent" refer to Exelis Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than Vectrus). Exelis was acquired by Harris Corporation in May 2015. 
Acquisition of SENTEL Corporation
In January 2018, we acquired SENTEL Corporation, a U.S. government contractor with expertise in logistics and supply chain management, engineering and advanced information technology solutions for spectrum management systems, sensor networks, border and perimeter surveillance systems and other detection systems, and multidisciplinary mission support for various intelligence community clients. The acquisition advanced our strategy to be a leader in the converging physical and digital infrastructure market and enhanced our information technology, technical solutions and logistics capabilities while expanding our client base to customers in the U.S. intelligence community. SENTEL’s customers included the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. The purchase price of $36.9 million was funded by cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Our Business Strategy 
Our goal is to be an innovator and leader in the convergence of our clients' physical and digital infrastructure and supply chains. Our overall strategy is to leverage our historical client base and capabilities to solidify our leadership in the rapidly expanding converged infrastructure market. 
We will seek to drive growth through the following three strategies: Enhance the Foundation, Expand the Portfolio, and Add More Value. These core strategies will evolve to include more innovative, technology-enabled methods, capabilities and business models. Key components of these strategies, and our progress in executing these strategies, include:

4


• | Enhance the Foundation. We will enhance our business by strengthening our methods and approaches to deliver higher value, high-impact services to our clients, while growing in, and around, our base. One of the components associated with this strategy is the development and execution of growth campaigns. Our campaigns lay out a deliberate approach to growth in a specific customer set or market by establishing differentiated value, strategic positioning, a tailored attack plan, and a specific goal to build or take market share. In 2018, we continued to advance our U.S. Air Force base operations support campaign, which has resulted in a significant expansion of our work with this client. The U.S. Air Force comprised 20% of our total revenue in 2018 compared to 16% in 2017. This targeted campaign has yielded positive results, and we are currently executing a similar campaign with the U.S. Navy.

We cultivate an enterprise-wide Vectrus Improvement Project (VIP) culture that encourages every Vectrus employee to implement measurable improvements. The VIPs align with our business objectives, benefiting our clients, employees, and overall performance. We support this VIP culture with an internal reward and recognition program and a robust internal training program, equipping our leaders with the tools to sustain our daily approach to continuous improvement. Our VIPs are a core component of how we deliver higher value, high-impact services to clients. 

• | Expand the Portfolio. We are focused on creating a higher-value, technology-enabled and differentiated platform through strengthening our IT competencies and fusing the physical and digital aspects of our clients' facility and logistics missions. We package our capabilities by leveraging our strong foundation in facility and base operations; supply chain and logistics services; and information technology mission support. In addition, we seek to partner with highly innovative third parties. The result will be a more technology-enabled, differentiated and higher value portfolio.

We are making solid progress in this strategy. In 2018, we established a presence within the intelligence community through the acquisition of SENTEL. We are currently leveraging our VIP culture and strong foundation in facilities, logistics and IT to further expand our footprint with this important client.

• | Add More Value. The convergence of our clients' physical and digital infrastructure and supply chains represents an opportunity to improve the outcomes of our clients' missions while creating a higher value, growth-oriented platform. We are structuring our long-term strategy to take advantage of this opportunity and to shape our future. This includes creating more predictive, agile and responsive infrastructures and supply chains as well as standardizing, improving, and automating our core operational capabilities to create a significantly differentiated, growth-oriented business.

We made progress on this strategy in 2018 by leveraging the unique capabilities resulting from the SENTEL acquisition. In 2018, we launched the Argus solution at the Annual Meeting and Exposition of the Association of the U.S. Army. Argus produces aggregated sensor, video, and map data on a single screen. This platform helps our clients close gaps in security, operational efficiency, and time management, ultimately increasing our value proposition.
Additionally, in 2018, we initiated Enterprise Vectrus, an enterprise-wide program to combine our VIPs and other enterprise improvement initiatives into a single enterprise-wide management system. Part of our implementation of Enterprise Vectrus includes the establishment of a regional service center, which leverages our global presence, enhances our client support, and ultimately lowers costs.
We focus on the following service offerings in support of the U.S. government: facility and logistics services and information technology and network communications services. We strive to bring our service capabilities to all of our customers. Our primary geographic areas of operation include Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the U.S.

Customers
We attribute the strength of our relationship with the DoD to our focus on program performance, global responsiveness and operational excellence, as well as our core values of Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. We treat sales to our U.S. government customers as sales within the U.S. regardless of where the services are performed. 
Revenue by U.S. government customer for the periods presented below was as follows: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
(In thousands) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Army | $ | 934,427 | | | $ | 915,554 | | $ | 1,004,842
Air Force | 259,511 | | | 177,338 | | | 165,611
Navy | 38,802 | | | 21,896 | | | 20,066 
Other | 46,564 | | | — | | | — 
Total revenue | $ | 1,279,304 | | | $ | 1,114,788 | | $ | 1,190,519

Competition
Our competition varies depending on our service offerings. In facility and logistics services, our primary competitors are PAE Facilities Management (PAE), Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. (DynCorp International), KBR Inc., Fluor Corporation and AECOM. Our principal competitors in information technology and network communications services include divisions of Leidos Holdings, Inc., Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Peraton, and General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. (GDIT). There are typically fewer competitors in the overseas market for each of our services capabilities.
The U.S. government has implemented policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. From time to time, certain U.S. government work in the U.S. has been restricted to small businesses, including Alaska native companies. We participate with these small businesses as a subcontractor for select opportunities, as appropriate. In addition, we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services will help us to win and perform the contract. Our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs.

Competitive bids for the work that Vectrus pursues are based on technical qualifications and corporate experience in performing contracts of similar size and scope, and are highly price sensitive. While not every contract is procured via selection of the lowest priced bidder, customers are sensitive to cost based on their budget allocations. Acquisition cycles are long (generally 12 to 24 months), and contracts are typically multi-year contracts that include an initial period of one-year or less with annual one-year (or less) option periods for the remaining contract period. 
Some U.S. government customers have shown a strong preference for multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. These contracts offer awards to a pool of contractors, followed by competition within the pool for individual programs via task orders under each IDIQ over the period of performance. The period of performance under IDIQ contracts follows a traditional three-to-ten-year performance cycle. The governing IDIQ contracts often have multi-billion dollar ceiling values. 
Our company closely monitors costs to foster highly competitive pricing and uses an in-house business development model both to manage the cost of revenue and capture opportunities for future bids. 
Seasonality
We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. However, various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of awards, product deliveries, customer acceptance of products and services, contract phase-in durations, contract completions, and the availability of customer funding. Weather and natural phenomena can also temporarily affect the performance of our services. 
The U.S. government's fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. U.S. government agencies may award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the time frame leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. 
Regulatory Environment
The U.S. government markets in which we serve are highly regulated. When working with U.S. agencies and entities, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the creation, administration and performance of contracts. Among other things, these laws and regulations: 

• | Require compliance with government standards for contract administration, accounting and management internal control systems;


• | Define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various flexibly priced U.S. government contracts;


• | Require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;


• | Require us not to compete for, or to divest ourselves of, work if an organizational conflict of interest exists related to such work that cannot be appropriately mitigated; and


• | Restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.

U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various rules regarding procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, allowable costs, contract performance, contract termination and adjustment, audits, and IT system security and privacy controls. In addition, as government contractors, we are subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review our performance, cost structure, incurred costs, forward pricing rates and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards under our contracts. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, and related government business systems. 
The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new or revised contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance training relevant to their respective positions. 
We are subject to other U.S. government laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the False Claims Act. When working overseas, we must comply not only with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, but also with foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, 
9

which may differ from U.S. laws, including regulations relating to import-export control, foreign tax considerations, data privacy, foreign labor and environmental law, and anti-corruption. 
Contracts
U.S. government programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts to a prime contractor, which may utilize one or more subcontractors. Our company usually is a prime contractor on long-term contracts that are of a finite duration of generally between three and ten years. We were the prime contractor on contracts representing 94%, 97% and 95% of our revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In other contracts, we team with the prime contractor as a subcontractor. The U.S. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as the U.S. Congress approves further appropriations. Prior to the expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, it typically begins a competitive rebidding or recompete process. The contracts and subcontracts under a program generally are subject to termination for convenience or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or if they change. The U.S. government is required to equitably adjust a contract for additions to or reductions in scope or other changes, including price, which it directs. 
Generally, the sales price elements for our contracts are cost-plus, cost-reimbursable or firm-fixed-price. We commonly have elements of cost-plus, cost-reimbursable and firm-fixed-price contracts on a single contract. 
On a cost-plus type contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract’s fee arrangement, up to funding levels predetermined by our customers. On cost-plus type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts. Most of our cost-plus contracts also contain a firm-fixed-price element. Cost-plus type contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship between total allowable and target cost. 
On most of our contracts, a cost-reimbursable element captures consumable materials required for the program. Typically, these costs do not bear fees. 
A firm-fixed-price type contract typically offers higher profit margin potential than a cost-plus type contract, which is commensurate with the greater levels of risk we assume on a firm-fixed-price type contract. On a firm-fixed-price type contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined contract price. Although a firm-fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Although the overall scope of work required under the contract may not change, profit may be adjusted as experience is gained and as efficiencies are realized or costs are incurred.
The percentage of our total revenue generated from each contract type for the periods presented was as follows: 
 | Year Ended December 31,
Contract type | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Cost-plus and cost-reimbursable | 78 | % | | 73 | % | 75 | %
Firm-fixed-price | 22 | % | | 27 | % | 25 | %
Total revenue | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Backlog
For a discussion of our backlog, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Backlog” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the maintenance of a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and visitors. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change, the nature of which is inherently unpredictable, and the timing of potential changes is uncertain. Environmental, health and safety requirements are significant factors affecting all of our operations, and we have established a comprehensive program to address compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. 
10

Employees
Integrity, Respect and Responsibility are our core values. We maintain rigorous compliance and other corporate responsibility programs that are intended to ensure a safe and secure work environment and compliance with government regulations as well as allow employees to voice any concerns while knowing that matters raised will be appropriately addressed. Our company employs people of diverse backgrounds and we believe that our diversity enhances our creativity and enriches our work culture. We are committed to good corporate citizenship and intend to always seek to maintain the trust and support of the communities in which our employees work and live. 
Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 6,700 employees and approximately 6,500 subcontracted workers, spanning 129 locations in 22 countries. Approximately 2,400 of our employees are represented under 18 collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. In the ordinary course of business, a number of collective bargaining agreements will be subject to renegotiation in a given year. We do not expect that any of the contracts subject to renegotiation in 2019 (individually or as a whole) present a significant risk to our business. We believe that relations with our employees and union representatives are positive.
