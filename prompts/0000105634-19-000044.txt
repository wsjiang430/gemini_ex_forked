We provide construction services and building services directly to corporations, municipalities and federal and state governmental entities, owners/developers, and tenants of buildings. We also provide our construction services indirectly by acting as a subcontractor to general contractors, systems suppliers, construction managers, developers, property managers and other subcontractors. Our industrial services are generally provided directly to refineries and petrochemical plants. Worldwide, as of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 33,000 employees. 
Our revenues are derived from many different customers in numerous industries, which have operations in several different geographical areas. Of our 2018 revenues, approximately 95% were generated in the United States and approximately 5% were generated in foreign countries, substantially all in the United Kingdom. In 2018, approximately 61% of revenues were derived from our construction operations, approximately 28% of revenues were derived from our building services operations and approximately 11% of revenues were derived from our industrial services operations. 
During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented as discontinued operations.
The broad scope of our operations is more particularly described below. For information regarding the revenues, operating income and total assets of each of our segments with respect to each of the last three years, and our revenues and assets attributable to the United States and the United Kingdom for the last three years, see Note 18 - Segment Information of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Operations 
The electrical and mechanical construction services industry has grown over the years due principally to the increased content, complexity and sophistication of electrical and mechanical systems, as well as the installation of more technologically advanced voice and data communications, lighting, and environmental control systems in all types of facilities, in large part due to the integration of digital processing and information technology. For these reasons, buildings need extensive electrical distribution systems. In addition, advanced voice and data communication systems require sophisticated power supplies and extensive low-voltage and fiber-optic communications cabling. Moreover, the need for substantial environmental controls within a building, due to the heightened need for climate control to maintain extensive computer systems at optimal temperatures, and the demand for energy savings and environmental controls in individual spaces have over the years expanded opportunities for our electrical and mechanical services businesses. The demand for these services is typically driven by non-residential construction and renovation activity.

Our electrical and mechanical construction services primarily involve the design, integration, installation and start-up of, and provision of services relating to: (a) electric power transmission and distribution systems, including power cables, conduits, distribution panels, transformers, generators, uninterruptible power supply systems and related switch gear and controls; (b) premises electrical and lighting systems, including fixtures and controls; (c) process instrumentation in the refining, chemical processing, food processing and mining industries; (d) low-voltage systems, such as fire alarm, security and process control systems; (e) voice and data communications systems, including fiber-optic and low-voltage cabling; (f) roadway and transit lighting and fiber-optic lines; (g) heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and clean-room process ventilation systems; (h) fire protection systems; (i) plumbing, process and high-purity piping systems; (j) controls and filtration systems; (k) water and wastewater treatment systems; (l) central plant heating and cooling systems; (m) cranes and rigging; (n) millwrighting; and (o) steel fabrication, erection and welding. 
Our electrical and mechanical construction services generally fall into one of three categories: (a) large installation projects with contracts often in the multi-million dollar range that involve construction of manufacturing and commercial buildings and institutional and public works projects or the fit-out of large blocks of space within commercial buildings, (b) large and medium sized capital and maintenance projects for manufacturing, petrochemical, oil, industrial and commercial clients and (c) smaller installation projects typically involving fit-out, renovation and retrofit work. 
Our United States electrical and mechanical construction operations accounted for about 61% of our 2018 worldwide revenues. Of such revenues, approximately 39% were generated by our electrical construction operations and approximately 61% were generated by our mechanical construction operations. 
We provide electrical and mechanical construction services for both large and small installation and renovation projects. Our largest projects have included those: (a) for institutional purposes (such as educational and correctional facilities and research laboratories); (b) for manufacturing purposes (such as pharmaceutical plants, steel, pulp and paper mills, chemical, food, automotive and semiconductor manufacturing facilities and power generation); (c) for transportation purposes (such as highways, bridges, airports and transit systems); (d) for commercial purposes (such as office buildings, data centers, convention centers, sports stadiums and shopping malls); (e) for hospitality purposes (such as resorts, hotels and gaming facilities); (f) for water and wastewater purposes; (g) for healthcare purposes; (h) for process facilities (such as oil and gas refineries and chemical processing plants); and (i) for oil and gas pipeline compressor stations and terminal and metering facilities. Our largest projects, which typically range in size from $10.0 million up to and occasionally exceeding $150.0 million and are frequently multi-year projects, represented approximately 30% of our worldwide construction services revenues in 2018. 
Our projects of less than $10.0 million accounted for approximately 70% of our worldwide construction services revenues in 2018. These projects are typically completed in less than one year. They usually involve electrical and mechanical construction services when an end-user or owner undertakes construction or modification of a facility to accommodate a specific use. These projects frequently require electrical and mechanical systems to meet special needs such as critical systems power supply, fire protection systems, special environmental controls and high-purity air systems, sophisticated electrical and mechanical systems for data centers, new production lines in manufacturing plants, and office arrangements in existing office buildings. They are not usually dependent upon the new construction market. Demand for these projects and types of services is often prompted by the expiration of leases, changes in technology, or changes in the customer’s plant or office layout in the normal course of a customer’s business. 
We have a broad customer base with many long-standing relationships. We perform construction services pursuant to contracts with owners (such as corporations, municipalities and other governmental entities), general contractors, systems suppliers, construction managers, developers, other subcontractors and tenants of commercial properties. Institutional and public works projects are frequently long-term complex projects that require significant technical and management skills and the financial strength to obtain bid and performance bonds, which are often a condition to bidding for and winning these projects. 
We also install and maintain lighting for streets, highways, bridges and tunnels, traffic signals, computerized traffic control systems, and signal and communication systems for mass transit systems in several metropolitan areas. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture and install sheet metal air handling systems for both our own mechanical construction operations and for unrelated mechanical contractors. We also maintain welding and pipe fabrication shops in support of some of our mechanical operations. 
Our United States building services segment offers a broad range of services, including operation, maintenance and service of electrical and mechanical systems; commercial and government site-based operations and maintenance; facility maintenance and services, including outage services to utilities and manufacturing facilities; military base operations support services; mobile mechanical maintenance and services; floor care and janitorial services; landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; facilities management; vendor management; call center services; installation and support for building systems; program development,

management and maintenance with respect to energy systems; technical consulting and diagnostic services; infrastructure and building projects for federal, state and local governmental agencies and bodies; and small modification and retrofit projects. 
Our building services operations, which generated approximately 28% of our 2018 worldwide revenues, provide services to owners, operators, tenants and managers of all types of facilities both on a contractual basis for a specified period of time and on an individual task order basis. Of our 2018 building services revenues, approximately 82% were generated in the United States and approximately 18% were generated in the United Kingdom. 
Our building services operations have built upon our traditional electrical and mechanical services operations and our client relationships to expand the scope of services being offered and to develop packages of services for customers on a regional and national basis. 
Demand for our building services is often driven by customers’ decisions to focus on their core competencies, customers’ programs to reduce costs, the increasing technical complexity of their facilities and their mechanical, electrical, voice and data and other systems, and the need for increased reliability, especially in electrical and mechanical systems. These trends have led to outsourcing and privatization programs whereby customers in both the private and public sectors seek to contract out those activities that support, but are not directly associated with, the customer’s core business. Clients of our building services business include federal and state governments, institutional organizations, utilities, independent power producers, healthcare providers, and major corporations engaged in information technology, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, financial services, and manufacturing, as well as large retailers and other businesses with geographically dispersed portfolios throughout the United States. 
We currently provide building services in a majority of the states in the United States to commercial, industrial, institutional and governmental customers and as part of our operations are responsible for: (a) the oversight of all or most of the facilities operations, including repair and maintenance; (b) servicing, upgrade and retrofit of HVAC, electrical, plumbing and industrial piping and sheet metal systems in existing facilities; (c) interior and exterior services, including floor care and janitorial services, landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; (d) diagnostic and solution engineering for building systems and their components; and (e) maintenance and support services to manufacturers and power producers. 
We provide building services at a number of preeminent buildings, including those that house the Secret Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Foreign Affairs Training Center, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other government facilities, including the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We also provide building services to a number of military bases, including base operations support services to the Navy National Capital Region and the Army’s Fort Huachuca in Arizona, and are involved in a joint venture providing building services to NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. The agreements pursuant to which this division provides services to the federal government are frequently for a base period and a number of option years exercisable at the sole discretion of the government, are often subject to renegotiation by the government in terms of scope of services, and are subject to termination by the government prior to the expiration of the applicable term. 
Our United Kingdom subsidiary primarily focuses on building services and currently provides a broad range of services under multi-year agreements to public and private sector customers, including utilities, airlines, airports, real estate property managers, manufacturers, governmental agencies and the finance sector. 
Our industrial services business, which generated approximately 11% of our 2018 worldwide revenues, is a recognized leader in the refinery turnaround market and has a growing presence in the petrochemical market. Our industrial services business: (a) provides maintenance, repair and cleaning services for highly engineered shell and tube heat exchangers for refineries and petrochemical plants both in the field and at our own shops, including tube and shell repairs, bundle repairs, and extraction services, and (b) designs and manufactures new highly engineered shell and tube heat exchangers. We also perform a broad range of turnaround and maintenance services for critical units of refineries so as to upgrade, repair and maintain them. Such services include turnaround and maintenance services relating to: (i) engineering and planning services in advance of complex refinery turnarounds; (ii) overhaul and maintenance of critical process units (including hydrofluoric alkylation units, fluid catalytic cracking units, coking units, heaters, heat exchangers and related mechanical equipment) during refinery and petrochemical plant shut downs; (iii) replacement and new construction capital projects for refineries and petrochemical plants; and (iv) other related specialty services such as (a) welding (including pipe welding) and fabrication; (b) heater, boiler, and reformer repairs and replacements; converter repair and revamps; and vessel, exchanger and tower services; (c) tower and column repairs in refineries and petrochemical facilities; (d) installation and repair of refractory materials for critical units in process plants so as to protect equipment from corrosion, erosion, and extreme temperatures; and (e) acid-proofing services to protect critical components at refineries from chemical exposure.

Competition 
In our construction services, building services and industrial services businesses, we compete with national, regional and local companies, many of which are small, owner-operated entities that carry on their businesses in a limited geographic area, as well as with certain foreign companies. 
We believe that the electrical and mechanical construction services industry is highly fragmented and our competition includes thousands of small companies across the United States. In the United States, there are a few public companies focused on providing either electrical and/or mechanical construction services, such as Integrated Electrical Services, Inc., Comfort Systems USA, Inc. and Tutor Perini Corporation. A majority of our revenues are derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, technical capability and financial strength. Because we have total assets, annual revenues, access to bank credit and surety bonding, and expertise significantly greater than most of our competitors, we believe we have a significant competitive advantage over our competitors in providing electrical and mechanical construction services. Competitive factors in the electrical and mechanical construction services business include: (a) the availability of qualified and/or licensed personnel; (b) reputation for integrity and quality; (c) safety record; (d) cost structure; (e) relationships with customers; (f) geographic diversity; (g) the ability to control project costs; (h) experience in specialized markets; (i) the ability to obtain surety bonding; (j) adequate working capital; (k) access to bank credit; and (l) price. However, there are relatively few significant barriers to entry to several types of our construction services business. 
While the building services industry is also highly fragmented, with most competitors operating in a specific geographic region, a number of large United States based corporations such as AECOM Technology Corporation, Johnson Controls, Inc., Fluor Corp., J&J Worldwide Services, Cushman & Wakefield Inc., CB Richard Ellis, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Sodexo, Inc., Aramark Corporation and ABM Industries Incorporated are engaged in this field, as are large original equipment manufacturers such as Carrier Corp. and Trane Inc. In addition, we compete with several regional firms serving all or portions of the markets we target, such as Brickman Valley Crest, Inc., Kellermeyer Bergensons Services, Inc., SMS Assist, LLC and Ferandino & Sons, Inc. Our principal services competitors in the United Kingdom include ISS UK Ltd. and MITIE Group plc. The key competitive factors in the building services business include price, service, quality, technical expertise, geographic scope and the availability of qualified personnel and managers. Due to our size, both financial and geographic, and our technical capability and management experience, we believe we are in a strong competitive position in the building services business. However, there are relatively few barriers to entry to most of our building services businesses. 
In our industrial services business, we are one of the leading North American providers of maintenance and repair services for, and manufacturing of, highly engineered shell and tube heat exchangers and related equipment and a leader in providing specialized services to refineries and petrochemical plants. The market for providing these services and products to refineries and petrochemical plants is highly fragmented and includes large national industrial services providers, as well as numerous regional companies, including JV Industrial Companies Ltd., Matrix Service Company, Starcon, Turner Industries, Team, Inc., Cust-O-Fab, Dunn Heat, and Wyatt Field Service Company, among others. In the manufacture of heat exchangers, we compete with both U.S. and foreign manufacturers. The key competitive factors in the industrial services market include service, quality, ability to respond quickly, technical expertise, price, safety record and availability of qualified personnel. Due to our technical capabilities, safety record and skilled workforce, we believe that we are in a strong competitive position in the industrial services markets that we serve. Because of the complex tasks associated with turnarounds and the precision required in manufacturing heat exchangers, we believe that the barriers to entry in this business are significant.
Employees 
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 33,000 people, approximately 57% of whom are represented by various unions pursuant to approximately 400 collective bargaining agreements between our individual subsidiaries and local unions. We believe that our employee relations are generally good. Only two of these collective bargaining agreements are national or regional in scope. 
Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligations
Our remaining unsatisfied performance obligations (“remaining performance obligations”) at December 31, 2018 were $3.96 billion. Remaining performance obligations increase with awards of new contracts and decrease as we perform work and recognize revenue on existing contracts. We include a project within our remaining performance obligations at such time as the project is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Our remaining performance obligations include amounts related to contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total transaction price can be made.
Remaining performance obligations include unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts. Although many of our construction contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers, in accordance with industry practice, we do not limit the amount of unrecognized revenue included within remaining performance obligations due to the 
5

inherent substantial economic penalty that would be incurred by our customers upon cancellation. We believe our reported remaining performance obligations for our construction contracts are firm and contract cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us.
Remaining performance obligations also include unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of service contracts. However, to the extent a service contract includes a cancellation clause which allows for the termination of such contract by either party without a substantive penalty, the remaining contract term, and therefore, the amount of unrecognized revenues included within remaining performance obligations, is limited to the notice period required for the termination. 
Our remaining performance obligations are comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business, (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which the variable consideration constraint does not apply, and (e) other forms of variable consideration to the extent that such variable consideration has been included within the transaction price of our contracts. Such claim and other variable consideration amounts were immaterial for all periods presented. 
We estimate that 83% of our remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2018 will be recognized as revenues during 2019.
