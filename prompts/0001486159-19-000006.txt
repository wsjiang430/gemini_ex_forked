Item 1. Business
Overview
Oasis Petroleum Inc. (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was originally formed in 2007 and was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware in 2010. We are an independent exploration and production (“E&P”) company focused on the acquisition and development of onshore, unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the United States. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (“OPNA”) and Oasis Petroleum Permian LLC (“OP Permian”) conduct our exploration and production activities and own our proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties located in the North Dakota and Montana regions of the Williston Basin and the Texas region of the Delaware Basin, respectively. We operate a midstream services business through OMS Holdings LLC (“OMS”), through which we own a majority of the outstanding units of Oasis Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: OMP) (“OMP” or “Oasis Midstream”), which completed its initial public offering on September 25, 2017. We also operate a well services business through Oasis Well Services LLC (“OWS”).
As of December 31, 2018, we have accumulated 413,552 net leasehold acres in the Williston Basin, of which approximately 97% is held by production. We are currently exploiting significant resource potential from the Bakken and Three Forks formations, which are present across a substantial portion of our acreage. We believe the location, size and concentration of our acreage create an opportunity for us to achieve cost, recovery and production efficiencies through the development of our project inventory. In addition, on February 14, 2018, we closed on an acquisition of approximately 22,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, representing our initial entry into the Delaware Basin (the “Permian Basin Acquisition”). The Permian Basin Acquisition more than doubled our core net inventory and allows us to further capitalize on our operational strengths. As of December 31, 2018, we have accumulated 23,366 net leasehold acres in the Delaware Basin, of which approximately 67% is held by production. Our management team has a proven track record in identifying, acquiring and executing large, repeatable development drilling programs, which we refer to as “resource conversion” opportunities, and has substantial Williston Basin and Delaware Basin experience. 
In 2018, we completed and placed on production 121 gross operated wells and had average daily production of 82,525 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Boepd”) in the Williston and Delaware Basins. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,053 gross (784.6 net) operated producing horizontal wells in the Bakken and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin and 31 gross (29.5 net) operated producing horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2018, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers, estimated our net proved reserves to be 280.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”) in the Williston Basin, of which 67% were classified as proved developed and 70% were oil, and net proved reserves to be 40.5 MMBoe in the Delaware Basin, of which 30% were classified as proved developed and 80% were oil.
Our business
Our goal is to enhance value by investing capital to build reserves, production and cash flows at attractive rates of return through the following strategic tactics:

• | Efficiently develop our Williston Basin and Delaware Basin leasehold positions. We are developing our acreage positions to maximize the value of our resource potential, while maintaining flexibility to preserve future value when oil prices are low. During 2018, we completed and brought on production 114 gross (79.0 net) operated wells in the Williston Basin and 7 gross (6.3 net) operated wells in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2018, we had 64 gross operated wells waiting on completion in the Williston Basin and 4 gross operated wells awaiting completion in the Delaware Basin. Our 2019 capital plan contemplates completing and placing on production approximately 70 gross operated wells in the Williston Basin and approximately 9 to 11 gross operated wells in the Delaware Basin. We have the ability to increase or decrease the number of wells drilled and the number of wells completed during 2019 based on market conditions and program results.


• | Enhance returns by focusing on operational and cost efficiencies. Our management team is focused on continuous improvement of our operations and has significant experience in successfully operating cost-efficient development programs. We believe the magnitude and concentration of our acreage within the Williston Basin, particularly in the core of the play, has provided and will continue to provide us with the opportunity to capture economies of scale, including the ability to drill multiple wells from a single drilling pad into multiple formations, utilize centralized production and oil, gas and water fluid handling facilities and infrastructure, and reduce the time and cost of rig mobilization. The Permian Basin Acquisition enables us to transfer our technical, operational and managerial knowledge from full-field development of the Williston Basin to the Delaware Basin. In addition, we expect OMS and OWS to continue to provide operational synergies going forward compared to third party providers.

• | Adopt and employ leading drilling and completion techniques. Our team is focused on enhancing our drilling and completion techniques to maximize overall well economics. Completion techniques have significantly evolved over the past decade, resulting in increased initial production rates and recoverable hydrocarbons per well. High intensity completion techniques continue to deliver production performance greater than prior completion techniques. We continuously evaluate our internal drilling and completion results and monitor the results of other operators to improve our operating practices. This ongoing evolution may enhance our initial production rates, increase ultimate recovery factors, lower well capital costs and improve rates of return on invested capital.


• | Maintain financial flexibility. Based on current market conditions, we have a strong liquidity position. We have no short-term debt maturities, and as of December 31, 2018, we had $972.2 million of liquidity available, including $22.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $950.0 million in the aggregate of unused borrowing base capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facilities (as defined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”). Our liquidity position, along with internally generated cash flows from operations, will provide continued financial flexibility as we actively manage the pace of development on our acreage positions in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin. We currently believe we have access to the public and private capital markets, and we intend to maintain a balanced capital structure by prudently raising proceeds from future offerings as additional capital needs arise. We also continue to evaluate options to monetize certain assets in our portfolio, which could result in increased liquidity and lower leverage.


• | Pursue strategic acquisitions with significant resource potential. As opportunities arise, we intend to identify and acquire additional acreage and producing assets to supplement our existing operations. On February 14, 2018, we completed the Permian Basin Acquisition, and going forward, we may acquire additional acreage in the Williston Basin and Delaware Basin or may selectively target additional basins that would allow us to employ our resource conversion strategy on large undeveloped acreage positions similar to what we have accumulated in the Williston Basin.

Our competitive strengths
We have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will help us to successfully execute our business strategies:

• | Substantial leasehold position in two of North America’s leading unconventional oil-resource plays. We believe our Williston Basin acreage is one of the largest concentrated leasehold positions that is prospective in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 413,552 net leasehold acres in the Williston Basin, of which 400,711 net acres were held by production, and 70% of our 280.1 MMBoe estimated net proved reserves in this area were comprised of oil. In addition, we made our initial entry into one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2018, we had 23,366 net leasehold acres in the Delaware Basin, of which 15,767 net acres were held by production, and 80% of our 40.5 MMBoe estimated net proved reserves in this area were comprised of oil. In 2019, we will continue our drilling and completion activities in the Williston Basin as well as in the Delaware Basin.


• | Large, multi-year project inventory. We believe we have a large inventory of potential drilling locations that we have not yet drilled, a majority of which are operated by us, and the Permian Basin Acquisition more than doubled our top-tier inventory. We plan to complete approximately 70 gross operated wells with a working interest of approximately 65% in the Williston Basin and approximately 9 to 11 gross operated wells with a working interest of approximately 90% in the Delaware Basin in 2019.


• | Management team with proven operating and acquisition skills. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry with an average of more than 25 years of industry experience, including experience in multiple North American resource plays as well as experience in international basins. We believe our management and technical team is one of our principal competitive strengths relative to our industry peers due to our team’s proven track record in identification, acquisition and execution of resource conversion opportunities. In addition, our technical team possesses substantial expertise in horizontal drilling techniques and managing and acquiring large development programs.


• | Incentivized management team. In 2018, an average of 70% of our executive officers’ overall compensation was in long-term equity-based incentive awards, and such officers owned approximately 4.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018. We believe our executive officers’ ownership interest in us provides them with significant incentives to grow the value of our business for the benefit of all stakeholders.


• | Operating control over the majority of our portfolio. In order to maintain better control over our asset portfolio, we have established a leasehold position comprised primarily of properties that we expect to operate. As of December 31, 2018, 96% of our estimated net proved reserves were attributable to properties that we expect to operate. Approximately 94% of our 2018 drilling and completion capital expenditures and approximately 97% of our 2019 plan are related to operated wells. Controlling operations will allow us to dictate the pace of development and better manage the costs, type

and timing of exploration and development activities. We believe that maintaining operational control over the majority of our acreage will allow us to better pursue our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery through continuous improvement of drilling and completion techniques. We are also better able to control infrastructure investment to drive down operating costs, optimize oil price realizations and increase the monetization of gas production.

• | Vertical integration. Our investments in and operational control of OMS and OWS provide us with additional operational efficiencies and cost savings compared to our peers. This vertical integration helps us control capital dollars being spent in advance of production to ensure volumes flow, improve uptime performance of our producing wells, protect against rising service costs, increase transparency in the planning process and increase communications with vendors by purchasing directly from them.

Our operations - exploration and production activities
Proved reserves
Our estimated net proved reserves and related PV-10 at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are based on reports prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent reserve engineers. In preparing its reports, DeGolyer and MacNaughton evaluated 100% of the reserves and discounted values at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. Our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV-10 and Standardized Measure do not include probable or possible reserves and were determined using the preceding twelve months’ unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month index prices for oil and natural gas, which were held constant throughout the life of the properties. The unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior twelve months were $65.66 per Bbl for oil and $3.16 per MMBtu for natural gas, $51.34 per Bbl for oil and $2.99 per MMBtu for natural gas and $42.60 per Bbl for oil and $2.47 per MMBtu for natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. The information in the following table does not give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives. Future operating costs, production taxes and capital costs were based on current costs as of each year-end. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, please see the “Glossary of oil and natural gas terms” included at the end of this report. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see “Independent petroleum engineers” below. Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of our estimated net proved reserves (excluding derivative contracts) net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). PV-10 and Standardized Measure represent the present value of the future net revenues discounted at 10%, before and after income taxes, respectively.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information, and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. There can be no assurance that our estimated net proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or that prices and costs will remain constant. A substantial or extended decline in oil prices could result in a significant decrease in our estimated net proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV-10 in the future.

__________________ 

(1) | Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, less estimated future development, production, plugging and abandonment costs and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows.


(2) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), because it does not include the effect of income taxes on discounted future net cash flows. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas reserves. The oil and gas industry uses PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. See “Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure” below.

The following table provides additional information regarding our estimated net proved developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves by basin as of December 31, 2018:

 | Proved Developed | Proved Undeveloped
 | Oil(MMBbls) | Natural Gas(Bcf) | | Total(MMBoe) | Oil(MMBbls) | Natural Gas(Bcf) | | Total(MMBoe)
Williston Basin | 134.6 | | 325.5 | | 188.8 | | 61.5 | | 178.4 | 91.2 
Delaware Basin | 9.9 | | 14.0 | | 12.3 | | 22.4 | | 34.9 | 28.2 
Total | 144.5 | | 339.5 | | 201.1 | | 83.9 | | 213.3 | 119.4

Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2018 were 320.5 MMBoe, a 3% increase from estimated net proved reserves of 312.2 MMBoe at December 31, 2017, primarily due to increases of 38.4 MMBoe for additions and 32.9 MMBoe for acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, partially offset by a decrease of 30.1 MMBoe for production, net negative revisions of 16.9 MMBoe and 15.9 MMBoe for divestitures of non-strategic assets in the Williston Basin. The net negative revisions were attributable to negative revisions of 42.3 MMBoe due to well performance and 9.4 MMBoe associated with alignment to the five-year development plan, offset by positive revisions of 14.7 MMBoe for the addition of proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) that were previously removed from our five-year development plan, 14.4 MMBoe due to higher realized prices and 5.4 MMBoe for ownership adjustments. Our proved developed reserves increased 0.3 MMBoe, or 0.1%, to 201.1 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 200.8 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to our 2018 development program, which included 137 gross (85.5 net) wells that were completed and brought on production during 2018 
7

and resulted in conversions of PUDs of 48.9 MMBoe and additions of 9.0 MMBoe. In addition, increases in proved developed reserves were due to purchases of 8.7 MMBoe, offset by decreases of 30.1 MMBoe for production, net negative revisions of 20.2 MMBoe and 15.9 MMBoe for divestitures. Proved developed revisions were primarily due to negative revisions of 33.0 MMBoe for performance largely related to higher than anticipated decline rates in recently developed spacing units, partially offset by positive revisions of 12.2 MMBoe due to higher realized prices. Our proved undeveloped reserves increased 8.0 MMBoe, or 7%, to 119.4 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 111.4 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to additions of 29.4 MMBoe, acquisitions of 24.2 MMBoe and net positive revisions of 3.4 MMBoe, offset by the conversion of wells to proved developed of 48.9 MMBoe. The proved undeveloped revisions were primarily due to positive revisions of 14.7 MMBoe for the addition of PUDs that were previously removed from our five-year development plan, 5.6 MMBoe for ownership adjustments and 2.2 MMBoe due to higher realized prices, offset by negative revisions of 9.4 MMBoe associated with alignment to the anticipated five-year development plan and 9.3 MMBoe for performance largely related to the associated impact of higher than anticipated decline rates in recently developed spacing units.
Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 312.2 MMBoe, a 2% increase from estimated net proved reserves of 305.1 MMBoe at December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase of 51.2 MMBoe for additions, partially offset by a decrease of 24.1 MMBoe for production and net negative revisions of 19.2 MMBoe. These net negative revisions were attributable to negative revisions of 39.1 MMBoe due to well performance and 2.1 MMBoe for alignment to the anticipated five-year development plan, offset by positive revisions of 16.1 MMBoe due to higher realized prices and 2.5 MMBoe for ownership adjustments. Our proved developed reserves increased 10.2 MMBoe, or 5%, to 200.8 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 190.6 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to our 2017 development program, which included 153 gross (63.0 net) wells that were completed and brought on production during 2017 and resulted in additions of 17.9 MMBoe and conversions of 32.0 MMBoe. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 24.1 MMBoe for production and negative revisions of 14.2 MMBoe. Proved developed revisions were primarily due to negative revisions of 29.7 MMBoe for performance revisions largely related to higher than anticipated decline rates in recently developed spacing units, offset by positive revisions of 14.1 MMBoe from increased realized prices. Our proved undeveloped reserves decreased to 111.4 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 114.5 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the conversion of wells to proved developed of 32.0 MMBoe and negative revisions of 5.0 MMBoe, partially offset by 33.3 MMBoe of additions. The proved undeveloped revisions were primarily due to negative revisions of 9.4 MMBoe for performance revisions largely related to the associated impact of higher than anticipated decline rates in recently developed spacing units and negative revisions of 1.8 MMBoe associated with alignment to the five-year development plan, offset by positive revisions of 2.6 MMBoe for ownership adjustments and 2.0 MMBoe from increased realized prices. In 2017, we divested 1.4 MMBoe of reserves associated with reservoirs other than the Bakken or Three Forks formations.
Reconciliation of Standardized Measure to PV-10
PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10:

 | At December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
 | | | (In millions) | | 
Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | 4,050.3 | | | $ | 3,300.7 | | $ | 2,483.1
Add: present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% | 624.0 | | | 383.0 | | | 144.7
PV-10 | $ | 4,674.3 | | | $ | 3,683.7 | | $ | 2,627.8

The PV-10 of our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2018 was $4,674.3 million, a 27% increase from PV-10 of $3,683.7 million at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher commodity price assumptions and an increase in reserves year over year.

Proved undeveloped reserves
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 119.4 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves as compared to 111.4 MMBoe at December 31, 2017.
The following table summarizes the changes in our proved undeveloped reserves during 2018:

 | Year EndedDecember 31, 2018
 | (MBoe) 
Proved undeveloped reserves, beginning of period | 111,392 | 
Extensions, discoveries and other additions | 29,384 | 
Purchases of minerals in place | 24,194 | 
Sales of minerals in place | — | 
Revisions of previous estimates | 3,387 | 
Conversion to proved developed reserves | (48,927 | )
Proved undeveloped reserves, end of period | 119,430 | 

During 2018, we spent a total of $659.3 million related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, $79.2 million of which was spent on proved undeveloped reserves that represent wells in progress at year-end. The remaining $580.1 million resulted in the conversion of 48.9 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves, or 44% of our proved undeveloped reserves balance at the beginning of 2018, to proved developed reserves. We added 29.4 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves as a result of our five-year development plan. The 2018 proved undeveloped revisions of 3.4 MMBoe were primarily due to positive revisions of 14.7 MMBoe for the addition of PUDs that were previously removed from our five-year development plan, 5.6 MMBoe for ownership adjustments and 2.2 MMBoe due to higher realized prices, offset by negative revisions of 9.4 MMBoe associated with alignment to the anticipated five-year development plan and 9.3 MMBoe for performance largely related to the associated impact of higher than anticipated decline rates in recently developed spacing units.
We expect to develop all of our proved undeveloped reserves, including all wells drilled but not yet completed, as of December 31, 2018 within five years after the initial year booked. The future development of such proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecasts as well as access to liquidity sources, such as capital markets, our Revolving Credit Facilities and our derivative contracts. All proved undeveloped locations are located on properties where the leases are held by existing production or continuous drilling operations. Approximately 15% of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018 are attributable to wells that have been drilled but not yet completed, and 74% and 26% of our undrilled reserves are within our core acreage in the Williston Basin and Delaware Basin, respectively.

Technology used to establish proved reserves
In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” means deterministically, the quantities of oil and/or natural gas are much more likely to be achieved than not, and probabilistically, there should be at least a 90% probability of recovering volumes equal to or exceeding the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by using reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007). The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by us to DeGolyer and MacNaughton and the analyses of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved.
A performance-based methodology integrating the appropriate geology and petroleum engineering data was utilized for the evaluation of all reserves categories. Performance-based methodology primarily includes (i) production diagnostics, (ii) decline-curve analysis and (iii) model-based analysis (if necessary, based on the availability of data). Production diagnostics include data quality control, identification of flow regimes and characteristic well performance behavior. Analysis was performed for all well groupings (or type-curve areas).
Characteristic rate-decline profiles from diagnostic interpretation were translated to modified hyperbolic rate profiles, including one or multiple b-exponent values followed by an exponential decline. Based on the availability of data, model‑based analysis may be integrated to evaluate long-term decline behavior, the impact of dynamic reservoir and fracture parameters on well performance, and complex situations sourced by the nature of unconventional reservoirs. The methodology used for the analysis was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, production history and appropriate reserves definitions.
Internal controls over reserves estimation process
We employ DeGolyer and MacNaughton as the independent reserves evaluator for 100% of our reserves base. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with the independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished for the reserves estimation process. Brett Newton, Senior Vice President of Asset Management and Chief Engineer, is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing our reserves evaluation process.

Production, revenues, price and cost history
We produce and market oil and natural gas, which are commodities. The price that we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, access to markets, weather and other seasonal conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Over or under supply of oil or natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Oil supply in the United States has grown dramatically over the past several years, putting downward pressure on oil prices. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue in the future. A substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices, in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.”
The following table sets forth information regarding our oil and natural gas production, realized prices and production costs for the periods indicated.

Net production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2018 were 30,122 MBoe as compared to net production of 24,143 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our net production volumes increased from 2017 to 2018, primarily due to our acquisition of producing properties in connection with the Permian Basin Acquisition and a successful operated and non-operated drilling and completion program, offset by the natural decline in production in wells that were producing as of December 31, 2017. Average oil sales prices, without derivative settlements, increased by $13.33 per barrel, or 27%, to an average of $61.84 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Giving effect to our derivative transactions in both periods, our oil sales prices increased $4.66 per barrel to $52.65 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $47.99 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Net production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 24,143 MBoe as compared to net production of 18,436 MBoe for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our net production volumes increased from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to our acquisition of producing properties in December 2016 and a successful operated and non-operated drilling and completion program, offset by the natural decline in production in wells that were producing as of December 31, 2016. Average oil sales prices, without derivative settlements, increased by $9.87 per barrel, or 26%, to an average of $48.51 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Giving effect to our derivative transactions in both periods, our oil sales prices increased $1.31 per barrel to $47.99 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $46.68 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Productive wells
The following table presents the total and operated gross and net productive wells by basin as of December 31, 2018:

Total wells | 137 | | 85.5 | | 153 | | 63.0 | | 64 | 38.1

Over the past several years, we have focused on full field development and have concentrated on improving capital efficiency and completing more wells using high-intensity completion techniques. We also continued to participate in a number of wells on a non-operated basis. 
We did not drill any dry hole wells in 2018, 2017 or 2016.
As of December 31, 2018, we had six operated rigs running, 6 gross (4.2 net) operated wells drilling and an inventory of 68 gross operated wells waiting on completion. We expect to continue to concentrate drilling activities within our top-tier acreage in 2019, including our acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin as well as our acquired acreage in the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin.
Capital expenditures
In 2018, we spent $1,925.8 million on capital expenditures, excluding midstream capital expenditures, which represented a 220.4% increase as compared to the $601.1 million spent on capital expenditures, excluding midstream, during 2017. Excluding acquisitions of $951.9 million in 2018, which includes the Permian Basin Acquisition, and $54.0 million in 2017, our non-midstream capital expenditures increased to $974.0 million from the $547.1 million spent during 2017, which represented a 78.0% increase year over year. This increase was attributable to increased drilling and completion activity as a result of higher commodity prices in 2018. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash flows used in investing activities.”
13

We have decreased our planned 2019 capital expenditures as compared to 2018, excluding acquisitions and midstream, as a result of current commodity prices. Our total 2019 capital expenditure plan, excluding midstream capital expenditures, is approximately $540 million to $560 million, which includes approximately $405 million to $420 million focused in the Williston Basin and approximately $135 million to $140 million focused in the Delaware Basin (with approximately 85% of the E&P capital allocated to drilling and completions). In addition, our 2019 planned capital expenditures includes other capital expenditures for OWS and administrative capital and excludes capitalized interest of approximately $15 million. We plan to complete and place on production approximately 70 gross operated wells in the Williston Basin and approximately 9 to 11 gross operated wells in the Delaware Basin in 2019. 
While we have planned approximately $540 million to $560 million in 2019 for these purposes, the ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions and the success of our drilling results as the year progresses. Additionally, if we acquire additional acreage, our capital expenditures may be higher than planned. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Description of properties
As of December 31, 2018, we had 101 gross (56.7 net) wells in the process of being drilled or completed in the Williston and Delaware Basins, which includes 6 gross operated wells drilling, 68 gross operated wells waiting on completion and 27 gross non-operated wells drilling or completing. We participated in 137 gross (85.5 net) wells that were completed and brought on production during 2018.
Williston Basin
As of December 31, 2018, our operations were focused in the North Dakota and Montana areas of the Williston Basin. Our development activities are currently concentrated in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Our management team originally targeted the Williston Basin because of its oil-prone nature, multiple producing horizons, substantial resource potential and management’s previous professional history in the basin. The Williston Basin also generally has established infrastructure and access to materials and services. Our development activity is focused in the deepest part of the Williston Basin, which we call our top-tier acreage.
As of December 31, 2018, our total leasehold position in the Williston Basin consisted of 413,552 net acres, and our estimated net proved reserves in the Williston Basin were 280.1 MMBoe, of which 188.8 MMBoe were proved developed reserves and 91.2 MMBoe were proved undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 826.7 net producing wells and 785.6 net operated producing wells in the Williston Basin. We had average daily production of 78,203 net Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the Williston Basin. During 2018, our Bakken and Three Forks wells produced a daily average of 78,168 net Boe per day with 784.6 net operated producing wells on December 31, 2018. Accordingly, our 784.6 net operated producing Bakken and Three Forks wells were responsible for nearly 100% of our average daily production during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our working interest for all producing Bakken and Three Forks wells averaged 59% and averaged 75% in the wells we operate. 
Delaware Basin
On February 14, 2018, we closed the Permian Basin Acquisition, which represented our initial entry into the Delaware Basin. The assets underlying the Permian Basin Acquisition are primarily located in the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations of the Delaware sub-basin, across Ward, Winkler, Loving and Reeves Counties, Texas.
As of December 31, 2018, our total leasehold position in the Delaware Basin consisted of 23,366 net acres, and our estimated net proved reserves in the Delaware Basin were 40.5 MMBoe, of which 12.3 MMBoe were proved developed reserves and 28.2 MMBoe were proved undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 52.4 net producing wells and 46.6 net operated producing wells in the Delaware Basin. We had average daily production of 4,322 net Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the Delaware Basin. During 2018, our horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin produced a daily average of 4,164 net Boe per day with 29.5 net operated producing wells on December 31, 2018. Accordingly, our 29.5 net operated producing horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin were responsible for nearly 96% of our average daily production during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our working interest for all producing horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin averaged 29% and in the wells we operate averaged 95%. 
14

Continuous Development Agreement. In connection with the closing of the Permian Basin Acquisition, Forge Energy, LLC (“Forge Energy”) entered into and assigned to OP Permian a continuous development agreement with the Commissioner of the General Land Office, on behalf of the State of Texas (collectively, the “State”), as approved by the Board for Lease of University Lands (the “Board,” and together with the State, “University Lands”). This agreement concerns certain leases covering a substantial portion of the acreage that the Company indirectly acquired from Forge Energy in the Permian Basin Acquisition and under which University Lands is the lessor. Pursuant to this agreement, the tracts covered by these leases are pooled into a single development area for which the Company indirectly holds an eight year initial term ending on December 31, 2025, with an additional five year term for certain retained acreage at certain depths in the Delaware, Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations. If OP Permian fails to meet certain drilling and development obligations, this agreement may be subject to early termination, in which case, the additional five year term would begin on such date and we may be obligated to pay non-performance fees of up to approximately $100 million.
Marketing, transportation and major customers
The Williston Basin crude oil rail and pipeline transportation and refining infrastructure has grown substantially over the past decade, largely in response to drilling activity in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. In December 2018, oil production in North Dakota was approximately 1,401,000 barrels per day. According to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority website’s data last updated January 15, 2019, there was approximately 1,421,000 barrels per day of combined crude oil pipeline transportation and refining capacity and approximately 1,520,000 barrels per day of specifically dedicated rail loading capacity in the Williston Basin as of December 31, 2018. In 2018, we continued to sell a significant amount of our crude oil production through gathering systems connected to multiple pipeline and rail facilities. These gathering systems, which typically originate at the wellhead, reduce the need to transport barrels by truck from the wellhead. As of December 31, 2018, we were flowing approximately 88% of our gross operated oil production through these gathering systems in the Williston Basin. In the Delaware Basin, approximately 51% of our gross operated oil production was connected to oil gathering systems as of December 31, 2018.
Crude oil produced and sold in the Williston Basin has historically sold at a discount to the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil index price (“WTI”) due to transportation costs and takeaway capacity. In the past, there have been periods when this discount has substantially increased due to the production of oil in the area increasing to a point that it temporarily surpasses the available pipeline transportation, rail transportation and refining capacity in the area. Expansions of both rail and pipeline facilities have reduced the prior constraint on oil transportation out of the Williston Basin and improved netback pricing received at the lease. In 2015, our price differentials relative to WTI strengthened as new pipelines opened to eastern Canada and U.S. markets and transportation on rail gradually declined. Since 2016, our price differentials have averaged less than $5.00 per barrel discount to WTI. In the second half of 2017 and throughout most of 2018, our crude oil price differentials improved to less than $2.00 per barrel discount to WTI primarily due to the additional takeaway capacity of the Dakota Access Pipeline of over 500,000 barrels per day. In the fourth quarter of 2018, above average refinery maintenance combined with production in the basin reaching record levels temporarily caused basis differentials to widen to more than $6.50 per barrel discount to WTI, but have since come back in line with the first three quarters of 2018. Our market optionality on the crude oil gathering systems allows us to shift volumes between pipeline and rail markets in order to optimize price realizations. In the Delaware Basin, price differentials in 2018 averaged more than $4.00 per barrel below WTI due to pipeline constraints. Expansions of pipelines occurring in 2019 should greatly reduce these differentials and provide ample takeaway for our Delaware production beginning in mid-2019. For a discussion of the potential risks to our business that could result from transportation and refining infrastructure constraints in the Williston Basin, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—Insufficient transportation, end-market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices.”
We principally sell our oil and natural gas production to refiners, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline and rail facilities. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. For a description of some of these factors, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—Insufficient transportation, end-market refining utilization or natural gas processing capacity in the Williston Basin and Delaware Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil and natural gas prices.”
In an effort to improve price realizations from the sale of our oil and natural gas, we manage our commodities marketing activities in-house, which enables us to market and sell our oil and natural gas to a broad array of potential purchasers. As of December 31, 2018, we sold a substantial majority of our oil and condensate through bulk sales at delivery points on crude oil gathering systems to a variety of purchasers at prevailing market prices under short-term contracts that normally provide for us to receive a market-based price, which incorporates regional differentials that include, but are not limited to, transportation costs. In addition, from time to time we may enter into third party purchase and sales transactions that allow us to optimize our 
15

advantageous gathering and transportation positions and increase the value of our oil price realizations. We also entered into various short-term sales contracts for a portion of our portfolio at fixed differentials. Due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections, we do not believe that the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, no purchaser accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Shell Trading (US) Company accounted for approximately 16% of our total sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to PBF Holding Company LLC accounted for approximately 10% of our total sales. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our total oil and natural gas sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are a number of alternative crude oil and natural gas purchasers in the Williston and Delaware Basins.
Since most of our oil and natural gas production is sold under market-based or spot market contracts, the revenues generated by our operations are highly dependent upon the prices of and demand for oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control, including but not limited to seasonality, weather, competition, availability of transportation and gathering capabilities, worldwide and regional economic conditions, global and domestic oil supply, foreign imports, political conditions in other oil-producing and natural gas-producing regions, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and domestic government regulation, legislation and policies. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices, in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.” Furthermore, a decrease in the price of oil and natural gas could have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our estimated proved reserves and on our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—If oil and natural gas prices decline substantially or for an extended period of time from their current levels, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.”
Market, economic, transportation and regulatory factors may in the future materially affect our ability to market our oil or natural gas production. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.”
Our operations - midstream services
We continue to develop our midstream services business, which includes produced and flowback water gathering and disposal, natural gas gathering, compression and processing, fresh water supply and distribution and crude oil gathering and transportation. Our midstream services assets are strategically located in the Williston Basin and Delaware Basin and support our upstream operations. These assets also provide services to third party customers. 
Our midstream services operations include those of OMP, a publicly-traded consolidated subsidiary and limited partnership that owns, develops, operates and acquires a diversified portfolio of midstream assets in North America. OMP is a growth-oriented, fee-based master limited partnership we formed in 2014 and organized in a development company structure. On September 25, 2017, OMP completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common units. At December 31, 2018, our ownership interest in OMP consisted of a 67.6% limited partner interest and 90% controlling interest in its general partner interest, which owns all of OMP’s incentive distribution rights and its non-economic general partner interest. OMP conducts its operations through its three development companies (collectively, the “DevCos”): Bighorn DevCo LLC (“Bighorn DevCo”), Bobcat DevCo LLC (“Bobcat DevCo”) and Beartooth DevCo LLC (“Beartooth DevCo”). 
OMP divides its operations into two primary areas with developed midstream infrastructure, both of which are supported by significant acreage dedications from us. In Wild Basin, we have dedicated to OMP approximately 65,000 acres, of which approximately 29,000 acres are within our current gross operated acreage position, and in which OMP has the right to provide oil, natural gas and water services to support our existing and future volumes. Outside of Wild Basin, we have dedicated to OMP approximately 581,000 acres for produced and flowback water services, of which approximately 299,000 acres are within our current gross operated acreage. In addition, we have dedicated to OMP approximately 364,000 acres for freshwater services, of which approximately 203,000 acres are within our current gross operated acreage. In addition, OMP has received certain commitments from third parties in which OMP has the right to provide its full suite of midstream services to support existing and future third party volumes.
16

Contractual arrangements
In connection with the OMP IPO, we entered into several 15-year, fee-based contractual arrangements with OMP for midstream services, including (i) gas gathering, compression, processing and gas lift services; (ii) crude gathering, stabilization, blending, storage and transportation services; (iii) produced and flowback water gathering and disposal services; and (iv) freshwater supply and distribution services. In addition, we provide substantial labor and overhead support for OMP. Upon completion of the OMP IPO, we entered into a 15-year services and secondment agreement with OMP pursuant to which we provide all personnel, equipment, electricity, chemicals and services (including third-party services) required for OMP to operate such assets, and OMP reimburses us for its share of the actual costs of operating such assets. In addition, pursuant to the services and secondment agreement, we perform centralized corporate, general and administrative services for OMP, such as legal, corporate recordkeeping, planning, budgeting, regulatory, accounting, billing, business development, treasury, insurance administration and claims processing, risk management, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, investor relations, cash management and banking, payroll, internal audit, taxes and engineering. We have also seconded to OMP certain of its employees to operate, construct, manage and maintain its assets, and OMP reimburses us for direct general and administrative expenses we incurred for the provision of the above services. The expenses of executive officers and non-executive employees are allocated to OMP based on the amount of time spent managing its business and operations.
OMP public offering and dropdown
On November 14, 2018, OMP completed a public offering of 2,300,000 common units (including 300,000 common units issued pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units) representing limited partnership interests, at a price to the public of $20.00 per common unit. OMP received net proceeds from the public offering of approximately $44.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs, which were used to fund a portion of its acquisition of additional ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo and Beartooth DevCo. 
In connection with the OMP public offering, on November 19, 2018, OMP acquired an additional 15% ownership interest in Bobcat DevCo increasing its ownership to 25% and an additional 30% ownership interest in Beartooth DevCo increasing its ownership to 70% in exchange for consideration of $251.4 million (“OMP Dropdown”).
The $251.4 million consideration consisted of $172.4 million in cash and 3,950,000 common units representing limited partner interests in OMP. OMP funded the cash portion of the consideration with a combination of borrowings under the revolving credit facility among OMP, as parent, OMP Operating LLC, a subsidiary of OMP, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the “OMP Credit Facility”) and proceeds from its public offering of common units. As a result of the OMP Dropdown, we now own 75% of the non-controlling interests of Bobcat DevCo and 30% of the non-controlling interests of Beartooth DevCo.
Capital expenditures
In 2018, midstream capital expenditures primarily related to the second natural gas processing plant constructed in our Wild Basin area in North Dakota and the development of additional midstream infrastructure in the Wild Basin area in North Dakota. We have decreased our planned 2019 midstream capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, to approximately $150.0 million to $170.0 million as compared to 2018 midstream capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. 
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is worldwide and highly competitive in all phases. We encounter competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all areas of operation, including the acquisition of leasing options on oil and natural gas properties to the exploration and development of those properties. Our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, numerous independent oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well established companies that have substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. Such companies may be able to pay more for lease options on oil and natural gas properties and exploratory locations and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.”

Title to properties
As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we initially conduct a preliminary review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant title defects. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with general industry standards. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of the properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens to secure borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect our carrying value of the properties. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the oil and natural gas industry and our business—We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.”
Seasonality
Winter weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit or temporarily halt our drilling, completion and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Such seasonal anomalies can also pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and may increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay or temporarily halt our operations.
Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry
Our oil and natural gas producing, midstream and well services operations are substantially affected by federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production, oil gathering and transportation, natural gas processing and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties for oil and natural gas production or otherwise provide midstream services have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas or the gathering, transportation and processing of those commodities, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells or processing of natural gas, bonding requirements to drill or operate producing or injection wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled or processing plants are constructed, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area, the siting of processing plants, disposal wells and gathering or transportation lines, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. 
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Historically, our compliance costs with applicable laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations; however, new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may occur and, thus, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. Additionally, environmental incidents such as spills or other releases may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may be finalized and become effective.
Regulation of transportation and sales of oil
Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil by common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates for oil pipelines that 
18

allows a pipeline to increase its rates annually up to prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index, without making a cost of service filing. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC oil index to change transportation rates annually every July 1, and our Bighorn DevCo Johnson’s Corner line will utilize the FERC oil index beginning on July 1, 2022. Every five years, FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index level in relation to changes in industry costs. Most recently, on December 17, 2015, FERC established a new price index for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, in which common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by Producer Price Index plus 1.23%.
On March 15, 2018, in a set of related issuances, FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (“Revised Policy Statement”) stating that, among other things and with respect to oil and refined products pipelines subject to FERC jurisdiction, the pipeline is required to reflect the impacts to its cost of service from the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) on Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6. This information will be used by FERC in its next five-year review of the oil pipeline index to generate the index level to be effective July 1, 2021, thereby including the effect of the Revised Policy Statement and the Tax Act in the determination of indexed rates prospectively, effective July 1, 2021. FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate, including the determination of the appropriate oil pipeline index, is based on many components, and tax-related changes will affect two such components, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes, while other pipeline costs also will continue to affect FERC’s determination of the appropriate pipeline index. Accordingly, depending on FERC’s application of its indexing rate methodology for the next five-year term of index rates, the Revised Policy Statement and tax effects related to the Tax Act may impact our revenues associated with any transportation services we may provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates in the future, including indexed rates.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is generally governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
We sell a significant amount of our crude oil production through gathering systems connected to rail facilities. Several derailments of freight trains since 2013 have led transportation safety regulators in the United States and Canada to examine whether the hazardous nature of crude oil from the Bakken shale is being assessed properly prior to its shipment. In particular, there are concerns that the testing and ensuing designations of crude oil on the shipping documentation do not in all cases accurately capture the flammability of the Bakken shale crude oil. In early 2014, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) released a Safety Alert alerting regulators, emergency responders, transporters and shippers that crude oil from the Bakken shale may have flammability characteristics that are different from other forms of crude oil and that it was vital that all shipments of crude oil be tested and properly characterized on all shipping documentation. The Safety Alert also notified the regulated community that PHMSA and the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) had launched an enforcement initiative that involved unannounced inspections on crude oil shipments to test the contents of the shipments in order to ensure that they are properly characterized. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation released a report finding that, based on the results of this enforcement initiative from August 2013 to May 2014, Bakken shale crude oil tended to be more volatile and flammable than other crude oils, and thus posed an increased risk for a significant accident.
These events have also spurred efforts to improve the safety of tank cars that are used in transporting crude oil by rail. Since 2011, all new railroad tank cars that have been built to transport crude oil or other petroleum type fluids, including ethanol, have been built to more stringent safety standards. In 2015, PHMSA adopted a final rule that included, among other things, additional requirements to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol, a classification and testing program for crude oil, and a requirement that older DOT-111 tank cars be phased out beginning in October 2017 if they are not already retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards. The 2015 final rule also included a new braking standard for certain trains, designated new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids, such as routing analyses, speed restrictions and information for local government agencies and provided new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of energy products placed into transport; however, in September 2018, PHMSA published a final rule that removed requirements for the new braking standard established under its 2015 final rule. In 2016, PHMSA released a final rule mandating a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029. Additionally, in 2016, PHMSA proposed a new rule, which has not yet been finalized, that would expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans so that any railroad that transports a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train 
19

carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train must have a current, comprehensive, written plan. Also, in response to a petition from the New York Attorney General, PHMSA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (“ANPR”) in early 2017 stating that it was considering revising the Hazardous Materials Regulations to establish vapor pressure limits for unrefined petroleum-based products and potentially all Class 3 flammable liquid hazardous materials that would apply during the transportation of the products or materials by any mode. Similarly, in 2016, the FRA modified its accident and incident reports to gather additional data concerning rail cars carrying crude oil in any train involved in an FRA-reportable accident. In addition to these or other actions taken or proposed by federal agencies, a number of states proposed or enacted laws in recent years that encourage safer rail operations or urge the federal government to strengthen requirements for these operations.
Safety improvements or updates to existing tank cars that are imposed under PHMSA’s 2015 final rule requirements could drive up the cost of transport and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, we cannot assure that costs incurred by the railroad industry to comply with these enhanced standards resulting from PHMSA’s final rule will not increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices, the consequences of which could be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we believe that any such consequences would not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
Efforts are likewise underway in Canada to assess and address risks from the transport of crude oil by rail. For example, in 2014, Transport Canada issued a protective order prohibiting oil shippers from using 5,000 of the DOT-111 tank cars and imposing a three year phase out period for approximately 65,000 tank cars that do not meet certain safety requirements. Transport Canada also imposed a 50 mile per hour speed limit on trains carrying hazardous materials and required all crude oil shipments in Canada to have an emergency response plan. At the same time that PHMSA released its 2015 rule, Canada’s Minister of Transport announced Canada’s new tank car standards, which largely align with the requirements in the PHMSA rule. Likewise, Transport Canada’s rail car retrofitting and phase out timeline largely aligns with the timeline introduced under the 2015 and 2016 PHMSA rules. Transport Canada has also introduced new requirements that railways carry minimum levels of insurance depending on the quantity of crude oil or dangerous goods that they transport as well as a final report recommending additional practices for the transportation of dangerous goods. Both Transport Canada and PHMSA issued final rules in January 2018 and November 2018, respectively, that further harmonize their respective tank car standards, including with respect to tank car approvals and design requirements.
Historically, our hazardous materials transportation compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement regarding hazardous material transportation may occur in the future, which could directly and indirectly increase our operation, compliance and transportation costs and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with standards and regulations emerging from these existing and any future rulemakings will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we may incur significant constraints on transportation capacity during the period while tank cars are being retrofitted or newly constructed to comply with the new regulations. In addition, any derailment of crude oil from the Bakken shale or Delaware Basin involving crude oil that we have sold or are shipping may result in claims being brought against us that may involve significant liabilities. Although we believe that we are adequately insured against such events, we cannot assure you that our insurance policies will cover the entirety of any damages that may arise from such an event. Nonetheless, we believe that any such consequences would not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
Regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Beginning in 1992, FERC issued a series of orders, beginning with Order No. 636, to implement its open access 
20

policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role of providing the sale and transportation of natural gas as a single service has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
In 2000, FERC issued Order No. 637 and subsequent orders, which imposed a number of additional reforms designed to enhance competition in natural gas markets. Among other things, Order No. 637 revised FERC’s pricing policy by waiving price ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year experimental period, and effected changes in FERC regulations relating to scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation, penalties, rights of first refusal and information reporting. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by FERC under Order No. 637 will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.
The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Please see below the discussion of “Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry—Energy Policy Act of 2005.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. In addition, pursuant to Order No. 704, some of our operations may be required to annually report to FERC on May 1 of each year for the previous calendar year. Order No. 704 requires certain natural gas market participants to report information regarding their reporting of transactions to price index publishers and their blanket sales certificate status, as well as certain information regarding their wholesale, physical natural gas transactions for the previous calendar year depending on the volume of natural gas transacted. Please see below the discussion of “Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry—FERC market transparency rules.”
Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
Intrastate natural gas transportation and facilities are also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies, and certain transportation services provided by intrastate pipelines are also regulated by FERC. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Regulation of production
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. We own and operate properties in North Dakota and Montana, which have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, both states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within their jurisdictions.
The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.

Other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry
Energy Policy Act of 2005
On August 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). EPAct 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, EPAct 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. EPAct 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,269,500 per day, adjusted annually for inflation, for violations of the NGA and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,269,500 per violation per day, adjusted annually for inflation. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provision of EPAct 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rule makes it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but do apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order No. 704, as described below. The anti-manipulation rules and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
FERC market transparency rules
On December 26, 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors, natural gas marketers and natural gas producers, are required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.
Effective November 4, 2009, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the FTC issued a rule prohibiting market manipulation in the petroleum industry. The FTC rule prohibits any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale from: (a) knowingly engaging in any act, practice or course of business, including the making of any untrue statement of material fact, that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or (b) intentionally failing to state a material fact that under the circumstances renders a statement made by such person misleading, provided that such omission distorts or is likely to distort market conditions for any such product. A violation of this rule may result in civil penalties of up to $1,191,842 per day per violation, adjusted annually for inflation, in addition to any applicable penalty under the Federal Trade Commission Act.
22

Texas Railroad Commission oil and natural gas rules
The Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”), through its Oil and Gas Division, regulates the exploration, production, and transportation of oil and natural gas in Texas. Among other duties, the RRC develops and adopts regulations to prevent waste of the state’s oil and natural resources, protects the correlative rights of different interest owners, prevents pollution, and provides safety with respect to operations including, for example, hydrogen sulfide emissions. The RRC grants drilling permits based on established spacing and density rules. Additionally, each month, the RRC assigns production allowables on oil and natural gas wells based on factors such as tested well capability, reservoir mechanics, market demand for production, and past production, as well as receives operators’ production reports on oil leases and gas wells, and audits the oil disposition path to ensure production did not exceed allowables. The RRC also regulates oil field injection and disposal wells under a federally-approved program that includes permitting, annual reporting and periodic testing activities. Through this program, fluids are injected into either productive reservoirs under enhanced recovery projects to increase production or into non-productive reservoirs for disposal. In other pollution prevention activities, the RRC assures waste management is carried out by permitting pits and landfarming, discharges, waste haulers, waste minimization, and hazardous waste management tasks. To prevent pollution of the state’s surface and ground water resources, the RRC has an abandoned well plugging and abandoned site remediation program that uses funds provided by industry through fees and taxes. Wells and sites are remediated with funds from this program when responsible operators cannot be found.
North Dakota Industrial Commission oil and natural gas rules
The North Dakota Industrial Commission (“NDIC”) regulates the drilling and production of oil and natural gas in North Dakota. Beginning in 2012, the NDIC adopted more stringent rules, imposing increased bonding amounts for the drilling of wells, severely restricting the discharge and storage of production wastes such as produced water, drilling mud, waste oil and other wastes in earthen pits, implementing more stringent hydraulic fracturing requirements and requiring the provision of public disclosure on FracFocus.org regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In 2016, the NDIC approved a suite of additional rules for the conservation of crude oil and natural gas, including new requirements relating to site construction, underground gathering pipelines, spill containment bonding requirements for underground gathering pipelines, and construction of berms around facilities, which new requirements are now in effect. These requirements have increased the well costs incurred by us and similarly situated oil and natural gas E&P operators, and we expect to continue to incur these increased costs as well as any added costs arising from new NDIC legal requirements laws and regulations applicable to the drilling and production of oil and natural gas that may be issued in the future.
Furthermore, in 2014, the NDIC adopted an order intended to reduce natural gas flaring, which order was subsequently modified in late 2015 and the underlying flaring program’s policy goals were revised in November 2018. Please see below the discussion of “Environmental protection and natural gas flaring initiatives” for more information on this order. In addition, in 2014, the NDIC adopted conditioning standards that are now in effect and improve the safety of Bakken crude oil for transport. Among other things, the 2014 rule sets operating standards for conditioning equipment to properly separate production fluids, addresses limits to the vapor pressure of produced crude oil, and includes parameters for temperatures and pressures associated with the production equipment.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors.
Pipeline safety regulation
Certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act (“HLPSA”) with respect to oil and condensates and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (“NGPSA”) with respect to natural gas. The HLPSA and NGPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of oil and natural gas pipeline facilities. These laws have resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas (“HCAs”), such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New pipeline safety laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.
23

Legislation in recent years has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. The HLPSA and NGPSA were amended by the Pipeline, Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the “2011 Pipeline Safety Act”). The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In June 2016, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (the “2016 Pipeline Safety Act”) was passed, extending PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practices constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid or natural gas pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim regulations in 2016 to implement the agency’s expanded authority to address such conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property or the environment.
The adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in January 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule that significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA hazardous liquid pipeline integrity management requirements, such as, for example, periodic assessments, leak detection and repairs, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to a high consequence area. The final rule also imposes new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. However, the date of implementation of this final rule by publication in the Federal Register has been delayed following the January 2017 change in presidential administrations. In a second example, in March 2016, PHMSA announced a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas lines and gathering lines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for natural gas pipelines in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” that contain as few as five dwellings within a potential impact area; requiring natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus excluded from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures (“MAOP”); and requiring certain onshore and offshore gathering lines in Class I areas to comply with damage prevention, corrosion control, public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning standards. Additional requirements proposed by this proposed rulemaking would increase PHMSA’s integrity management requirements for natural gas pipelines and also require consideration of seismicity in evaluating threats to pipelines. PHMSA has split this proposed rule into three separate rulemaking proceedings and is expected to finalize those proceedings in 2019. New legislation or any new regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. In the absence of the PHMSA pursuing any legal requirements, state agencies, to the extent authorized, may pursue state standards, including standards for rural gathering lines. 
Environmental and occupational health and safety regulation
Our exploration, development and production operations, oil gathering and transportation activities, natural gas processing services and related operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling or provide midstream services; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in environmentally-sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions; impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites, pits, processing plants and pipelines; and impose specific criteria addressing worker protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any new laws or regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly well construction, drilling, water management or completion activities, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental spills or other releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including any third-party claims for 
24

damage to property, natural resources or persons. While, historically, our compliance costs with environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future as a result of such existing laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations, or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous substances and wastes
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These classes of persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
We are also subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Under the authority of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent nonhazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, pursuant to a consent decree issued by a federal court, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D regulations that result in such oil and natural gas wastes being regulated as hazardous wastes, or sign a determination that revision of those RCRA regulations is unnecessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Repeal or modification of the current RCRA exclusion or similar exemptions under state law could increase the amount of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and could cause us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, which could have a significant impact on us as well as reduce demand for our midstream and well services. 
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas or for conducting midstream services. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from, other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances and wastes were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial plugging or pit, processing plant or pipeline closure operations to prevent future contamination.
Air emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of various air pollutants from many sources through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs, and the imposition of other monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of 
25

certain pollutants. Obtaining permits has the potential to restrict, delay or cancel the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either “attainment/unclassifiable,” “unclassifiable” or “non-attainment.” Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA issued final requirements that apply to state, local and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. State implementation of these revised standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay, limit or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with this final rule or any other new legal requirements could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce, which one or more developments could adversely impact our production, midstream and well services businesses.
Environmental protection and natural gas flaring initiatives
We attempt to conduct our operations in a manner that protects the health, safety and welfare of the public, our employees and the environment. We are focused on the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, particularly with respect to flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites. The rapid growth of crude oil production in North Dakota in recent years, coupled with a historical lack of natural gas gathering infrastructure in the state, has led to efforts to reduce flaring of natural gas produced in association with crude oil production. We recognize the environmental and financial risks associated with natural gas flaring, and we seek to manage these risks on an ongoing basis, consistent with applicable requirements.
We believe that one of the leading causes of natural gas flaring from the Bakken and Three Forks formations is the inability of operators to promptly connect their wells to natural gas processing and gathering infrastructure due to external factors out of the control of the operator, such as, for example, the granting of right-of-way access by land owners, investment from third parties in the development of gas gathering systems and processing facilities, and the development and adoption of regulations. However, we have allocated significant resources to connect our Bakken and Three Forks wells to natural gas infrastructure to reduce our flared volumes. We have exceeded a goal that we voluntarily set in 2014 to maintain well connections for an average of 90% of our operated Bakken and Three Forks wells, by having approximately 98% of our operated Bakken and Three Forks wells connected to gathering systems since 2015. We believe that achieving this goal helps us to minimize our flared volumes of natural gas.
In 2014, the NDIC adopted Order No. 24665 (the “2014 Order”), pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” targeting the capture of natural gas produced in the state between October 1, 2014 and October 1, 2020. Modification of the July 2014 Order by the NDIC in late 2015, resulted in revised gas capture percentage goals of 88% and 91% required to be achieved by November 1, 2018 and November 1, 2020, respectively. Most recently, in November 2018, the NDIC considered revising its 2018 and 2020 gas capture percentage goals but elected to retain those standards; however, the NDIC revised the flaring program’s policy goals such that the oil and gas exploration and production industry has more flexibility in removing certain gas volumes from consideration in calculating compliance with the state’s gas capture percentage goals. The NDIC continues to adhere to other aspects of the modified 2014 Order, including development of Gas Capture Plans that provide measures for reducing the amount of natural gas flared by those operators so as to be consistent with the agency’s gas capture percentage goals. Also, wells must continue to meet or exceed the NDIC’s gas capture percentage goals on a statewide, county, per-field, or per-well basis. If an operator is unable to attain the applicable gas capture percentage goal at maximum efficiency rate, wells will be restricted in production to 200 barrels of oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or otherwise oil production from such wells shall not exceed 100 barrels of oil per day. However, the NDIC will consider flexibility to these production restrictions, by means of temporary exemptions, for other types of extenuating circumstances after notice and hearing if the effect of such flexibility is a significant net increase in gas capture within one year of the date such relief is granted. Monetary penalty provisions also apply under this policy in the event an operator not meeting the gas capture percentage goals fails to timely file for a hearing with the NDIC upon being unable to meet such percentage goals or if the operator fails to timely implement production restrictions once below the applicable percentage goals. As of December 31, 2018, we were capturing approximately 88% of our natural gas production in North Dakota. While we were satisfying the applicable gas capture percentage goals as of December 31, 2018 and expect to satisfy the November 1, 2020 gas capture percentage goals of 91%, there is no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future or that such future satisfaction of such goals will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Climate change
Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration by states or groupings of states of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.
At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction under Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual basis, including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which include certain of our operations. The EPA has amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. 
Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”), known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expand the previously issued NSPS Subpart OOOO requirements issued in 2012 by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. In June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the 2016 standards for two years but the rule was not finalized. Rather, in February 2018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the 2016 final rule, and in September 2018 the EPA proposed additional amendments, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements, such as fugitive emission monitoring frequency. Furthermore, in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaking from oil and natural gas operations on public lands. However, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that rescinds most of the new requirements of the November 2016 final rule and codifies the BLM’s prior approach to venting and flaring, but the rule rescinding the November 2016 final rule has been challenged in federal court and remains pending. Internationally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a United Nations-sponsored non-binding agreement in Paris, France (“Paris Agreement”) for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which provides for a four-year exit process beginning when the agreement took effect in November 2016. 
The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax, which one or more developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas we or our customers produce and lower the value of our reserves as well as reduce demand for our midstream and well services. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other studies by the private sector project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities.
Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our development and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate related damages to our facilities, our costs of operations potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by such climate effects, or increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such effects. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.

Water discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) issued a final rule outlining their position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States. The rule has been challenged in federal district court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been enjoined in twenty-eight states, including North Dakota, Montana and Texas, where we conduct operations, pending resolution of the legal challenges. In July 2017, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 rule and, in February 2018, the agencies published a final rule adding a February 6, 2020 applicable date to the 2015 rule. The February 2018 rule extending the 2015 final rule’s date of applicability is currently subject to litigation. Also, in December 2018, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, for which agencies will seek public comment. As a result of these developments, future implementation of the rule is uncertain at this time. To the extent this rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, drilling programs could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities and onshore facilities, including E&P facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under the OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
Operations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. These injection wells are regulated pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or analogous state agency for disposal wells that we operate, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be injected. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of fresh water, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, imposition of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of affected resources and imposition of liability by landowners or other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Moreover, any changes in the laws or regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new injection wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and ultimately increase the cost of our operations, which costs could be significant. Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of produced water from oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas as being among the states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and gas in order to address these seismic activity concerns within the state. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us or our customers. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in operational activities, our or our customers’ costs to operate may significantly increase and our or our customers’ ability to continue production or conduct midstream services or dispose of produced water may be delayed or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.

Hydraulic fracturing activities
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from unconventional formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. 
The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA’s UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities, as well as published an ANPR regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also issued final CAA regulations in 2012 and 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing or from compressors, controls, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, and certain other equipment. In addition, in 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, the BLM published a final rule in 2015 establishing new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in December 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM’s decision was filed in federal District Court in January 2018 and remains pending.
From time to time Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, some states, including North Dakota and Texas where we primarily operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high-volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Nevertheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.
Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to added delays, restrictions or cancellations in the pursuit of our operations or increased operating costs in our or our customers’ production of oil and natural gas. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations with respect to E&P activities and midstream services. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.
Endangered Species Act considerations
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and comparable state laws may restrict exploration, development and production activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the United States and prohibits the taking of endangered species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed or endangered species or modify their critical habitats. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. If endangered or threatened species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we or our customers wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed by seasonal or permanent restrictions or require the implementation of expensive mitigation. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency is required to make determinations on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted or planned could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in delays or limitations on our or our customers’ E&P activities, including the performance of drilling programs that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves or an indirect adverse impact on the demand for our midstream services.

Operations on federal lands
Performance of oil and natural gas E&P activities on federal lands, including Indian lands and lands administered by the federal BLM are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM and the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, to evaluate major agency actions, such as the issuance of permits that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Depending on any mitigation strategies recommended in such environmental assessments or environmental impact statements, we could incur added costs, which could be substantial, and be subject to delays, limitations or prohibitions in the scope of oil and natural gas projects or performance of midstream services. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt our or our customers’ E&P activities. 
Employee health and safety
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state regulations require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 727 people. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. From time to time we utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services.
Offices
As of December 31, 2018, we lease 130,300 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas at 1001 Fannin Street, where our principal offices are located, and sub-lease 8,820 square feet and 7,800 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas, and Midland, Texas, respectively. The lease for our Houston office expires in March 2029 and our sub-leases for our Houston and Midland offices expire in December 2019 and August 2020, respectively. We also own field offices in the North Dakota communities of Williston, Powers Lake, Alexander and Watford City.
