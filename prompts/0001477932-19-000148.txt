ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
 
All for One Media Corp. (referred to herein as the “Company,” “All for One” or “AFOM”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah on March 2, 2004, as “Early Equine, Inc.” The Company is principally engaged in content development of media targeted at the “tween” demographic consisting of children between the ages of seven and fourteen. We specialize in creating, launching, and marketing original pop music performed by “boy bands” and “girl groups,” though we also produce motion pictures, pre-recorded music, television, live concert performances, and licensed merchandise. On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an asset exchange agreement with Crazy for the Boys, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“CFTB”), wherein the Company acquired movie screenplays, master recordings, trademarks, URLs, and other assets from CFTB in exchange for 5,201,500 shares of the Company’s common stock. On November 4, 2015 the Company changed its name to All for One Media Corp.
 
We have generated nominal revenues, we have an accumulated deficit of $8.6 million as of September 30, 2018, and we anticipate generating losses for the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58,344, and we will need to raise capital to implement our planned operations. If we are unable to do so, an entire investment in our stock could be lost. To address this concern, we have had discussions with prospective investors interested in financing the Company directly, as well as joint venture partners who have expressed interest in funding or co-funding certain of our projects. Our independent public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion, which includes a statement that the results of our operations and our financial condition raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Competition
 
The Company competes with all forms of entertainment. A large number of companies, many with significantly more resources than All for One Media, Inc., produce and distribute film and music recordings, exploit products in the home entertainment market, and produce music for live theater and performance. Our competitive position primarily depends on the amount and quality of the content produced, its distribution and marketing success, and public response. We also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties, and many other rights that are essential to the success of our business. Operating results for these offerings are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, consumer preferences, levels of marketing and promotion, and by the timing and performance of releases, which may be directly or indirectly influenced by competitors.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Children’s Privacy
 
Various laws and regulations intended to protect the interests of children are applicable to our business, including measures designed to protect the privacy of minors online. As we are currently focused on marketing content to this demographic, we will be subject to these regulations. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) limits the collection of personal information online from children under the age of 13 by operators of websites or online services. Effective July 1, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission adopted revisions to regulations under COPPA to further expand the scope of the regulations. Such regulations also limit the types of advertising we are able to sell on our websites and applications and impose strict liability for certain actions of advertisers, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. State and federal policymakers are also considering regulatory and legislative methods to protect consumer privacy on the Internet, and these efforts have focused particular attention on children and teens.
Emerging Growth Company
 
We may be deemed to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.” As long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” prior to such time if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue, more than $700 million in market value of our common stock is held by non-”affiliates” or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we are subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company.” That designation will relieve us of some of the informational requirements of Regulation S-K.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
We are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will substantially increase our legal and accounting costs.

Exchange Act Reporting Requirements
 
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to the our stockholders.
 
We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities Exchange Commission on a regular basis, and are required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
