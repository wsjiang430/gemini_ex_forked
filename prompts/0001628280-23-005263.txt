ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Lee Enterprises, Incorporated, together with its subsidiaries, (“Lee”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a digital-first subscription platform providing local markets with valuable, high quality, trusted, intensely local news, information, advertising and marketing services. We are a rapidly growing digital subscription platform with more than 530,000 digital subscribers serving 77 mid-sized local communities in 26 states. Our core strategy aims to grow digital audiences and engagement through continuous improvements to subscriber experience, while offering a full suite of omni-channel advertising and marketing solutions local advertisers desire.
Our product portfolio includes digital subscription platforms, daily, weekly and monthly newspapers and niche publications, all delivering original local news and information. Our products offer print and digital editions, and our content and advertising is available in real time through our websites and mobile apps. We operate in predominately mid-sized communities with products ranging from large daily newspapers and associated digital products, such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The Buffalo News, to non-daily newspapers with news websites and digital platforms serving smaller communities.
We have made talent and technology investments to improve user experience, content, data visualization, and marketing to align with the shift in spending habits to digital products by both consumers and advertisers. In 2022, total digital revenues, which includes digital advertising and marketing services revenues, digital-only subscription revenues, and digital services revenues, were $240 million, or 31% of our total revenues.
We aim to grow our business through three main categories: subscriptions to our product offerings, advertising and marketing solutions to local advertisers, and digital services to a diverse set of customers. Execution of this strategy is expected to transform Lee into a vibrant, digitally centric company.
•Our digital subscription platforms are the fastest growing digital subscription platforms in local media. At the end of 2022, we had more than 530,000 subscribers to our digital platforms, up 32% over 2021. Revenue from digital only subscribers totaled more than $40 million in 2022, up 42% over 2021.
•Amplified Digital® ("Amplified"), our digital marketing services agency, offers a full suite of digital marketing solutions to local advertisers. Revenue at Amplified totaled almost $76 million in 2022, up 83% over 2021.
•BLOX Digital (formerly known as TownNews), our software as a service (SaaS) content platform, is one of the largest web-hosting and content management SaaS providers in North America. BLOX Digital represents a powerful opportunity to drive additional digital revenue by providing state-of-the-art web hosting and content management services to more than 2,000 customers who rely on BLOX Digital for their web, over-the-top display, mobile, video and social media products. Revenue at BLOX Digital, including intercompany revenue, totaled $31 million in 2022, and has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 10.6% over the last ten years.
We generate revenue primarily through advertising and marketing services, subscriptions to our digital and print products, and digital services, primarily through our majority-owned subsidiary, BLOX DIgital. Our operations also provide printing and distribution of third-party publications.
On March 16, 2020, we completed the acquisition of BH Media Group, Inc. ("BH Media") and The Buffalo News, Inc. ("Buffalo News"), adding 31 local media operations and nearly doubling our audience size and total operating revenue. See Note 3 — Acquisitions, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition.
Advertising and Marketing Services - In 2022, advertising and marketing services revenue of $366.4 million comprised 47% of total operating revenue.
There are two primary categories of print advertising revenue: local and national.
•Local advertising takes the form of display advertising in daily and non-daily publications and preprinted advertising inserted in the publication.
•National advertising is revenue earned from the sale of print display advertising space, or from preprint advertising inserted in the publication, from national accounts that do not have a local retailer representing the account in the market.
There are three main categories of digital advertising and marketing services revenue: digital media, digital classified and digital marketing services.
•Digital media represents all display advertising delivered on our owned and operated digital products.
•Digital classified represents digital advertising revenue associated with our classified partnerships including auto, employment, real estate, legal and obituaries.
•Digital marketing services represents a full suite of marketing services provided through Amplified, including targeted display, video, OTT, custom content, web development, social media management, search, events, email marketing and other tactics.
Amplified remains a key strategic priority for us in 2023. Our sales force deploys an omni-channel sales approach that leverages the auction-based ad buying that is widely adopted by all major digital advertising channels, and tailors advertising and marketing solutions based on the size, scale, and needs of the advertiser. Through Amplified we create sophisticated digital campaigns on our owned and operated sites and on third-party sites that give advertisers the ability to target their message to reach their desired audiences. We collaborate with Google and other ad tech companies to provide key metrics and analytics to measure campaign effectiveness.
Advertising and marketing services revenues are subject to moderate seasonality primarily due to fluctuations in advertising volumes tied to holidays and seasonal advertising. Our advertising and marketing services revenues are typically highest during the first quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the second quarter following the holiday season.
Subscription Revenue - In 2022, subscription revenue of $353.6 million comprised 45% of our total operating revenue. Subscription revenue is earned primarily from selling subscriptions to our content through our full access subscriptions, digital-only subscriptions and single copy sales.
Our full access subscriptions include access to all of our content on multiple platforms; including our print products delivered or made available to consumers, websites, smartphone and tablet applications, and e-editions with pricing varying significantly by market and by frequency. Consistent with general publishing industry trends, print subscription volumes declined in 2022.
We experienced rapid growth of our digital-only subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions include access to our content on our digital platforms. At the end of the fiscal year, we had 532,000 digital-only subscribers, up 32% compared to 2021, with revenue totaling $40 million, or up 42% compared to 2021. Growing our digital-only subscribers and digital-only revenue remains a top strategic priority in 2023. Our primary digital-only subscriber acquisition tactics include:
•Converting our significant organic traffic through on-platform promotion, paywalls, and dynamic meters;
•Continuously improving our subscriber experience; and 
•Brand marketing campaigns to raise awareness to the desirability of our content.
A variety of pricing strategies are also used, including discounted introductory periods and sales, to encourage trial and habituation before transitioning to the full price rate.
Digital Services Revenue – In 2022, digital services revenue of $18 million comprised 2.3% of our total operating revenue. In 2022, almost all of our digital services revenue is from BLOX Digital. BLOX Digital, operated through our 82.5% owned subsidiary INN Partners, L.C., is one of the largest web-hosting and content management SaaS providers in North America and offers state of the art integrated digital publishing and content management solutions for creating, distributing, and monetizing multimedia content.
•BLOX Digital is the engine that powers our digital products. In addition, BLOX Digital services nearly 2,000 daily customers, including legacy media publications, universities, television stations and niche publications.
•Including intercompany revenue generated from our markets, revenue at BLOX Digital grew almost 14% in 2022 and totaled $31 million.
•With strong product offerings, investments in video and streaming technology and diversifying the customer base into broadcast, BLOX Digital is positioned to continue to be a key component to our growth strategy.
Other Revenue - In 2022, Other Revenue of $60.9 million comprised 8% of total operating revenue. Excluding digital services revenue, other revenue is comprised mainly of commercial printing and delivery of third party products and until March 16, 2020 revenue from a Management Agreement between BH Media and the Company dated June 26, 2018 ("Management Agreement"). In 2022, other revenue excluding digital services of $18 million, comprised 5.5% of our total operating revenue, compared to $19 million and 6.1% in 2021.
We compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend. Our print and digital products competed with other forms of media including national media providers and amateur content creators, as well as other news and information outlets for subscription spend. The market for local digital marketing solutions is highly competitive and evolving allowing opportunities for new competitors to enter the market.
Amplified competes with other digital marketing solutions agencies as well as other media companies who have a similar strategy for digital marketing solutions. While some of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer histories as well as greater financial resources, we believe we compete favorably and our product capabilities meet customer requirements due to our data-driven, omni-channel sales approach, our experienced digital sales force and our overall customer satisfaction.
The number of competitors in any given market varies; however all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in all of our markets.
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
We are committed to a strategy that transforms Lee into a vibrant, digitally-centric business with recurring, sustainable digital revenue. Aligning with that commitment, our Three Pillar Digital Growth Strategy is focused on the following: 
Expand digital audiences by transforming the presentation of local news and information. We seek to maintain our position as the leading provider of news and information by providing best-in-class digital experiences to improve consumer engagement and grow our audiences. We aim to achieve this by delivering relevant, useful, and engaging content to the consumer using a multi-media approach with a heavy emphasis on video and audio.
In 2023, we plan to continuously improve the user experience with our digital products through targeted investments in top talent aimed at investigative journalism. Providing our local consumers with more and more high quality, trusted, engaging content is important to growing our digital audiences and driving subscription conversions.
We believe that our proprietary local content displayed in best-in-class multimedia platforms combined with new and engaging content and video channels will grow our audiences and increase our audience monetization capabilities.
Expand digital subscription base and revenue. We are the fastest growing digital subscription platform in local media. Digital-only subscriber growth continued at a rapid pace in 2022, offsetting the declines in our 
traditional full access (print and digital) subscribers. Our digital audiences are comprised of full access subscribers, digital-only subscribers and non-subscribers who access our sites subject to our paywalls. More than 53% of our full access subscribers have activated their digital access, and digital-only subscribers increased 32% in 2022, reaching 532,000 digital-only subscribers.
Our acquisition and retention tactics are focused on growing our digital subscription base by using data and analytics to direct our huge addressable market of 34 million unique visitors toward obtaining a digital subscription. In 2023, our primary digital-only subscriber acquisition tactics include:
•Converting our significant organic traffic through on-platform promotion, paywalls, and dynamic meters;
•Continuously improving our subscriber experience; and 
•Brand marketing campaigns to raise awareness to the desirability of our content.
Using these techniques, we expect digital-only subscribers to continue to grow substantially, reaching more than 900,000 digital-only subscribers by 2026.
We believe our digital transformation will have a favorable impact on the environment. A key component to our digital growth strategy is to accelerate the pace of digital subscriber growth. Growing our digital revenue streams as the print revenues mature will have a favorable impact on the environment as our production hubs will consume less energy, we will consume less newsprint, and there will be less environmental impact from our distribution channels that largely operate on fossil-fuel powered transportation.
Diversify and expand offerings for local advertisers. According to eMarketer, local advertising spending is expected to reach nearly $115 billion in 2023. Our vast array of rapidly growing digital products, our large, digitally adept salesforce and Amplified, our full service digital agency, creates a powerful opportunity to gain scale both in and outside of our local markets.
•Our local sales forces are larger than any local competitor, and we believe they are the most highly trained and proficient sales force in our markets.
•We have strong relationships with businesses in our markets and offer a wide array of products to deliver our advertisers' message.
Amplified remains a key strategic priority for us in 2023 as we expect it to fuel growth of our digital advertising and marketing services. Our salesforce deploys an omni-channel sales approach that leverages the auction-based ad buying that is widely adopted by all major digital advertising channels, and tailors advertising and marketing solutions based on the size, scale, and needs of the advertiser. Through Amplified we create sophisticated digital campaigns on our owned and operated sites and on third-party sites that give advertisers the ability to target their message to reach their desired audiences. We collaborate with Google and other ad tech companies to provide key metrics and analytics to measure campaign effectiveness.
BLOX Digitals represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue through their SaaS content platform. In 2022, revenue at BLOX Digital, including intercompany revenue, totaled $31 million and since 2011 the compounded annual growth rate of BLOX Digital revenue has been 11%. Through continuous investment in product development and gaining essential technology, like world-class video and streaming technology, BLOX Digital is the leading CMS provider in the publishing CMS segment and is growing its market share in the broadcast CMS segment. In 2023, we believe we can grow revenue at BLOX Digital through modest market share gains in our core markets, increasing our average revenue per customer.

NEWSPRINT
The raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can affect our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, included herein.
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
We believe the foundation of our business is the people and employees who carry out the various tactics that support our business strategy. A major focus in 2022 was investing in the top digital talent to carry out our Three Pillar Digital Growth Strategy and position us to achieve our long-term growth targets
At September 25, 2022, we had approximately 4,365 employees, including approximately 788 part-time employees, exclusive of TNI and MNI. Full-time equivalent employees in 2022 totaled approximately 4,064 of which 722 are represented by unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. We are committed to an equitable and inclusive workplace that also reflects the diversity of our local readers and communities in which we serve. In 2021, we hired a Director of News and Talent Development who is charged with improving diversity in our newsrooms and hiring practices that promote a more complete and inclusive news coverage of the communities in which we serve.
We continue to demonstrate our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by assessing our hiring practices, extending our hiring reach, providing skill-building opportunities on diverse storytelling, and developing business strategies that include historically marginalized communities. These efforts and initiatives will help us reach our goal of a more diverse workforce at all levels of our company.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC INFORMATION
We have a long history of sound corporate governance practices. Currently, our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that eight of its nine members are independent, including all members of the Board's Audit, Executive Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees. The Audit Committee approves all services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm and its affiliates.
At www.lee.net, one may access a wide variety of information, including news releases, SEC filings, financial statistics, annual reports, investor presentations, governance documents, newspaper profiles and digital links. We make available via our website all filings made by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and related amendments, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. All such filings are available free of charge. The content of any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report") is not incorporated by reference unless expressly noted.
