ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Overview and background
 
On January 17, 2018, Virtual Crypto Technologies, Inc., f/k/a Emerald Medical Technologies, Inc. (the “Registrant” or “Company”) formed Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd as a new wholly-owned subsidiary under the laws of the State of Israel (“Virtual Crypto Israel”) and appointed Mr. Alon Dayan, who has served as the Registrant’s Chief Executive Officer since June 30, 2018 and has been a member of the Company’s Board of Directors since March 14, 2018, as CEO of Virtual Crypto Israel. Virtual Crypto Israel was formed to develop and market software and hardware products facilitating, allowing and supporting purchase and/or sale of cryptocurrencies through ATMs, tablets, PCs and/or mobile devices (the “Products”).
 
On January 29, 2018, pursuant to resolution of the Registrant’s Board of Directors, the Registrant transferred the management shares of the Registrant’s former Israeli subsidiary, Emerald Medical Applications Ltd. (“Emerald IL”) to Attorney Eviatar Knoller, Esq., with offices in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel, as trustee (the “Trustee”) for the purpose of enabling the Trustee to liquidate the management shares and/or the assets of Emerald IL to satisfy its debts.
 
The Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on January 24, 2018, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), reporting that Virtual Crypto Israel had entered into a binding term sheet (the “Chiron Term Sheet”) with Chiron Refineries Ltd. (“Chiron”), a public company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: CHR). Pursuant to the Chiron Term Sheet: (i) Virtual Crypto Israel agreed to appoint a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chiron, to be organized under the laws of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the “Distributor”), as the exclusive distributor of Virtual Crypto Israel’s Products in Turkey, including the territory of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (collectively, the “Territory”); and (ii) the Distributor shall have the right to appoint sub-distributors within the Territory. The appointment of the Distributor was subject to the payment by the distributor to Virtual Crypto Israel of $250,000 as an appointment fee, of which $150,000 was to be deemed an advance payment by the distributor made on account of future purchases of the Company’s Products.
 
The Company further granted the Distributor an option, exercisable by the Distributor within 12 months from the date on which the ATM Product, including the related software and hardware, was fully tested and ready for installation and operation, to be appointed as an exclusive distributor of the Products for the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If the option was exercised, the Distributor was required to pay Virtual Crypto Israel an appointment fee not more than $250,000. In November 2018, Chiron reported that it had encountered financial difficulties and as such the Company will no longer pursue the transactions contemplated by the Chiron Term Sheet.
 To date, $100,000 was paid by the Distributor to Virtual Crypto Israel, which has been recognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.


The Registrant filed a Definitive Information Statement on February 12, 2018 to change its name from Emerald Medical Applications Corp. to Virtual Crypto Technologies, Inc. to reflect its new operations and business focus and, effective on March 7, 2018, FINRA approved the Registrant’s name change and its trading symbol was changed from MRLA to VRCP on the OTCQB.
 
The disclosure in this annual report relates to our business activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Additional disclosure has been included in this annual report related to recent developments and subsequent events that occurred after the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Reference is made to the disclosure in Note 10-Subsequent Events, to the Notes to Consolidated financial Statements.
 
During the period commencing January 16, 2018 through March 23, 2018, the Registrant raised $1.9 million in equity capital (the “Equity Raise”) through the offering of units (the “Unit Offering”) at a price of $0.07 per Unit, each Unit consisting of: (i) one (1) share of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”); (ii) one (1) common stock purchase warrant exercisable for a period of twelve months to purchase one additional Share at an exercise price of $0.14 per Share (the “Class F Warrants”); and (iii) one (1) common stock purchase warrant exercisable for a period of twelve months to purchase one additional Share at an exercise price of $0.28 per Share (the “Class G Warrants”).The proceeds of the Equity Raise are being utilized by the Registrant to fund the operations of Virtual Crypto Israel including, but not limited to the costs associated with the development of the Products. Reference is made to the disclosure under Item 5. “Market For Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters And Issuer Purchase Of Equity” and under the subcaption “Sale of Unregistered Securities in 2018” with respect to the Equity Raise from the sale of units in 2018.

Recent Developments
 
Share Exchange Agreement
 
The operations of Virtual Crypto Israel only generated revenues of $100,000 during the year end December 31, 2018 from one customer, Chiron, who has encountered financial difficulties. During 2018, we spent $790,413 in order to develop our systems in an industry that has experienced significant difficulties over the last 18 months. We believe that this has led to a decrease in the anticipated demand for Virtual Crypto Israel’s products and services. Therefore, on February 7, 2019, we filed a Form 8-K reporting that the Registrant entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Algomizer Ltd., an Israeli Corporation (“Algomizer”), pursuant to which Algomizer will assign, transfer and deliver its 99.83% holdings in Viewbix Ltd., an Israeli corporation, to us in exchange for shares of restricted common stock of representing 65% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis on the closing date, excluding certain warrants to purchase shares of common stock, which will expire in 2020 and with an exercise price representing a valuation equal to $30,000,000 (“Fully Diluted Share Capital”). In addition, upon the earlier of: (a) the launch of a live video product to an American consumer in the U.S by Viewbix Ltd., or (b) the launch of an interactive television product to an American consumer in the U.S., Viewbix Ltd., we will issue Algomizer additional shares of restricted common stock of the Company representing 5% of the Fully Diluted Share Capital.
 
Furthermore, on the closing date, we will issue Algomizer: (i) warrants to purchase shares of restricted common stock with an exercise price representing a valuation for the Company of $15,000,000 on Fully Diluted Share Capital basis, which will represent 10% of the Fully Diluted Share Capital immediately following the closing, which warrants will be exercisable for a period of ten years, and (ii) warrants to purchase shares of restricted common stock with an exercise price representing a valuation for the Company of $25,000,000 on Fully Diluted Share Capital basis, which will represent 10% of the Fully Diluted Share Capital immediately following the closing, which latter warrants will be exercisable for a period of ten years.
 
The closing of the Share Exchange Agreement is conditioned upon us filing an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to change the Company’s name to ViewBix Inc., effecting a reverse split of our shares of common stock at a ratio of 1:15, which we intend to effect whether or not the transactions under the Share Exchange Agreement will consummate, conversion of our outstanding convertible notes into shares of restricted common stock and Algomizer obtaining a tax pre-ruling from the Israeli Tax Authority relating to the Share Exchange Agreement.

Reverse Stock Split


On February 26, 2019, stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation in order to affect a reverse stock split of the of our common stock on a 1-for-15 basis. We intend to effect such reverse stock split once all approvals for such actions are obtained.
 
Pursuant to the Reverse stock split, each fifteen (15) shares of our common stock will be automatically converted, without any further action by our stockholders, into one share of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued as the result of the reverse stock split. Instead, each stockholder will be entitled to receive one share of common stock in lieu of the fractional share that would have resulted from the reverse stock split.
