Item 1. Business.
OUR COMPANY
Entegris, Inc. (“Entegris”, “the Company”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) is a leading global developer, manufacturer and supplier of microcontamination control products, specialty chemicals and advanced materials handling solutions for manufacturing processes in the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. Our mission is to leverage our unique breadth of capabilities to create value for our customers by developing mission-critical solutions to maximize manufacturing yields, reduce manufacturing costs and enable higher device performance.
Semiconductors, or integrated circuits, are key components in modern electronic devices. Smartphones, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and other applications require faster, more powerful and more energy efficient semiconductors. In response to these requirements and the growing demand from these applications, semiconductor makers have been adding more capacity and semiconductor manufacturing technology has rapidly been moving to smaller dimensions, adopting new device architectures, such as FinFET transistors and 3D-NAND, and utilizing new and innovative manufacturing materials to increase transistor and bit density. As the technology node becomes increasingly complex, to enable improvements and to maximize yields, manufacturers require the effective development and application of new materials, a reliable and consistent supply of high-value materials, and contamination-free transportation, storage and delivery of these materials, seamlessly integrated into the semiconductor manufacturing process, at ever-increasing levels of purity and contaminant control. Additionally, the effective management and maintenance of the entire materials handling system, from initial production of process chemistry, to transportation and dispensing onto the wafer, has grown in importance to enhanced device yield. 
Entegris is uniquely positioned to rapidly respond to these challenges and to help our customers solve problems throughout their advanced manufacturing processes. We deliver advanced materials and high-purity chemistries, free from contamination, with optimized packaging and delivery solutions and in-process filtration and purification solutions that ensure high-value liquid chemistries and gases are free from contaminants before reaching the wafer. Our technology portfolio includes approximately 21,000 standard and customized products and solutions to achieve the highest levels of purity and performance that are essential to the manufacture of semiconductors, flat panel displays, light emitting diodes, or LEDs, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, gas lasers, optical and magnetic storage devices, and critical components for aerospace, glass manufacturing and biomedical applications. The majority of our products are consumed at various times throughout the manufacturing process, with demand driven in part by the level of semiconductor and other manufacturing activity. 
Our business is organized and operated in three operating segments, which align with the key elements of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. The Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials, or SCEM, segment provides high-performance and high-purity process chemistries, gases, and materials, and safe and efficient delivery systems to support semiconductor and other advanced manufacturing processes. The Microcontamination Control, or MC, segment offers solutions to filter and purify critical liquid chemistries and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries. The Advanced Materials Handling, or AMH, segment develops solutions to monitor, protect, transport, and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor industry and other high-technology industries. While these segments have separate products and technical know-how, they share a global generalist sales force, common business systems and processes, technology centers, and strategic and technology roadmaps. We leverage our expertise from these three segments to create new and increasingly integrated solutions for our customers.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR ECOSYSTEM
1

The manufacture of semiconductors requires hundreds of highly complex and sensitive manufacturing steps, during which a variety of materials are repeatedly applied to a silicon wafer to build integrated circuits on the wafer surface. We serve the semiconductor ecosystem by providing specialty materials and chemicals utilized in many process steps, offering a broad range of products to monitor, protect, transport, and deliver these critical process materials during the manufacturing process and providing systems to purify liquid chemistry and gases throughout the manufacturing process. The areas of the semiconductor ecosystem that rely most heavily on our products and solutions are described below.
Deposition. Deposition processes include physical vapor deposition (PVD), where a thin film is deposited on a wafer surface in a low-pressure gas environment, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where a thin film is deposited on a wafer surface by exposing it to one or more volatile precursors which react with the wafer surface, atomic-layer deposition (ALD), where a thin film is deposited on a wafer surface by exposing it to one or more precursors which react through a series of sequential, self-limiting reactions, and electro-plating, where a metal layer, such as copper, is deposited using chemical baths. Our advanced precursor materials and electro-plating chemicals are utilized to meet the semiconductor industry’s composition, uniformity and thickness needs of deposited films. Our filtration and purification products are used to remove contaminants during the deposition process, consequently reducing defects on wafers. These products are critical to ensuring device performance and the manufacturing yields of semiconductor manufacturers.
Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP). CMP is a polishing process used by semiconductor manufacturers to planarize, or flatten, many of the layers of material that have been deposited upon silicon wafers. We offer a broad range of products used by semiconductor manufacturers during and immediately following the CMP process. Our formulated cleaning chemistries remove residue from wafer surfaces after the CMP process, and prevent subsequent corrosion. Our filtration and purification systems are used to filter liquid slurries and cleaning chemistries in order to remove select particles and contaminants that can cause defects on a wafer’s surface. Our roller brushes are used in conjunction with our cleans chemistries to clean the wafer after completion of the CMP process in order to prepare the wafer for subsequent operations and our pad conditioners are used to prepare the surface of the CMP polishing pad prior to every polishing cycle.
Photolithography. Photolithography is a process repeated many times throughout the semiconductor manufacturing process that uses light to print complex circuit patterns onto the wafer. To print the projected optical pattern, the wafer is coated with a thin film of light-sensitive material, called photoresist. Light is projected to expose the photoresist, which is then developed (somewhat like photographic film) to create a stenciled image pattern. Our liquid filtration and liquid packaging and dispense systems play a vital role in assuring the pure, accurate and uniform dispense of photoresists onto the wafer so that manufacturers can achieve acceptable yields in the manufacturing process, and our gas microcontamination control systems eliminate airborne contaminants that can disrupt effective photolithography processes.
Etch and Resist Strip. During the etch process, specific areas of the thin film that have been deposited on the surface of a wafer are removed to leave a desired circuit pattern. After the etch process, the hardened resist needs to be completely removed. Our formulated chemical solutions remove photo resists and post-etch residues and our gas filters and purifiers help assure the purity of the process gas streams used in the etch process. Our precision-engineered coatings provide barriers to corrosive chemistries in the etch environment, protect surfaces from erosion and minimize particle generation. 
Ion Implant. Ion implantation is a key technology for forming transistors and is used many times during semiconductor fabrication. During ion implantation, wafers are bombarded by a beam of electrically-charged ions, called dopants, which change the electrical properties of the exposed surface films. Our Safe Delivery Source® (SDS®) and VAC® (Vacuum Actuated Cylinders) gas delivery systems assure the safe, effective and efficient delivery of the toxic gases necessary for the implant process. In addition, our proprietary low temperature plasma coating processes for core components are critical elements of ion implantation equipment.
Wet Cleaning. Ultra-high purity chemicals of precise composition are used to clean the wafers before and after several of the processes described above, to pattern circuit images and to remove photoresists after etch. The cleaning chemicals must be maintained at very high purity levels without the presence of foreign material such as particles, ions or organic contaminants in order to maintain manufacturing yields and avoid defective products. Our proprietary formulated cleaning chemistries are used in these wet cleaning processes and our liquid filters and purifiers ensure the purity of these chemicals.
Wafer Solutions. Our wafer and reticle carriers are high-purity “micro-environments” that carry wafers between manufacturing process steps. These products protect wafers from damage or abrasion and minimize contamination during transportation and automated processing. Front-end wafer processing can involve hundreds of steps and take several weeks. Protection of the processed wafer is essential, as a batch of fully processed 200 mm or 300 mm wafers transported in one of our products can be worth over a million dollars. 
Chemical Containers. Semiconductor manufacturing and other high-technology processes utilize large volumes of high-purity, corrosive and hazardous chemicals. Our ultrahigh purity chemical container products, such as drums, flexible packaging and 
2

associated coded connection systems, maintain chemical purity, maximize utilization and ensure safe transport, containment and dispense of valuable, ultraclean process fluids, from storage by the chemical manufacturer to point-of-use. Our FluoroPure® containers and NOWPak® liner-based systems maximize chemical retrieval and minimize chemical waste, which lowers our semiconductor manufacturer customers’ costs. Our portfolio of bottles, canisters, closures and accessories enhance tool productivity, increase yields and reduce operating costs. Relatedly, our ultrapure valves, fitting, tubings, and sensing and control products are used to distribute these chemicals around the fab and in wet process tools.
Other Markets. Many of the processes used to manufacture semiconductors are also used to manufacture photovoltaic cells, LEDs, flat panel displays and magnetic storage devices resulting in the need for similar filtration, purification, control and measurement capabilities. We seek to leverage our products, technologies and expertise to address these important market opportunities.
INDUSTRY TRENDS
Emerging Applications. The market for semiconductors has grown significantly over the past few decades and we expect this trend to continue. We believe that the smartphone, Internet of Things and emerging applications in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality will drive growth in the demand for semiconductors, drive wafer starts and create significant opportunities for our products. Existing applications in data processing, wireless communications, broadband infrastructure, personal computers, handheld electronic devices and other consumer electronics, are also expected to drive demand for semiconductors, and in turn, our products. 
Manufacturing Complexity and Architecture. The emerging applications described above require more powerful, faster and more energy efficient semiconductors. Semiconductor architectures are changing, with transistor design increasing in complexity, the use of multilayered patterning, vertical structures such as FinFET and 3D-NAND, and shrinking dimensions. These advanced architectures require an increase in the number of process steps required to manufacture these semiconductors. We believe that demand for our materials and consumable products will be driven by the increase in process steps and the associated lithography, deposition, CMP, and etch and clean required to manufacture leading edge semiconductors. Additionally, new materials have played a significant role in enabling improved devices performance and we expect this trend to continue. As dimensions get smaller, new materials will be required for transistor connectivity. For example, leading edge semiconductor manufacturers are moving towards atomic layer scale, where the precision of the manufacturing process and purity of the materials is extremely important to maintain the device integrity. These materials need to be supplied and delivered at ever-increasing levels of purity and control, from point-of-production to point-of-use and dispense on the wafer. We expect the trend for new materials supplied at high levels of purity to drive the demand for our advanced materials and our products and solutions designed to purify, monitor, protect, transport, and deliver critical materials. To address the challenges of the advanced technology nodes, we collaborate with our customers to develop new materials, to enhance our filtration and purification capabilities and to introduce advanced materials packaging and monitoring capabilities.
Material Handling Solutions. Our semiconductor customers have become increasingly focused on materials handling solutions that enable them to safely store, handle, process and transport critical materials throughout the manufacturing process to minimize the potential for damage or degradation to their materials and to protect their investment in processed wafers. We believe that these trends provide opportunities for us to utilize our unique breadth of capabilities to provide innovative materials, materials management, purification, wafer transport, and process solutions to semiconductor customers to enable them to successfully manage this growing complexity.
Reliance on Trusted Suppliers. Our customers require that their key materials suppliers demonstrate greater capabilities, such as sustainability, scalability, flexible manufacturing, quality control, supply chain management, and the ability to effectively collaborate on solutions to problems. We have responded to these demands by deploying resources to enable us to align with their requirements and drive operational excellence. For example, in 2016 and 2017, we expanded our technology centers in South Korea and Taiwan and we are currently building a technology center in Shanghai, China, adding to our research and development capabilities to enhance local development and collaboration and to strengthen relationships with our key customers. We believe these trends will allow us to leverage our manufacturing, operational and technical capabilities, along with our broad technology portfolio, to become an increasingly important strategic supplier to our customers.
Continued Consolidation. Our customer base within the semiconductor industry has consolidated through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, the importance of maintaining and developing strong and close relationships with our customers becomes even more essential. While continuing to strengthen these relationships, we also seek to further broaden our customer base by leveraging our products, technologies and expertise in serving semiconductor applications to address adjacent market opportunities, including in manufacturing processes for flat panel displays, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, optical magnetic storage devices and products for life sciences.

Manufacturing in China. An additional factor that could spur future industry growth is sustained semiconductor industry development in China, which has experienced recent growth in semiconductor production. Construction on an historic number of fabs has been commenced in recent years, and we expect that heavy investment in the semiconductor sector in China will continue, with more than 10 new fab projects expected to ramp in the next several years by local and multinational companies. As a result, we expect that China will remain one of the fastest growing regions in semiconductor industry. Additionally, existing fabs in China are working to rapidly enhance their capabilities to manufacture the latest generation advanced node products, targeting both leading-edge and mainstream applications. However, as Chinese fabs have been facing difficulty in obtaining the necessary technology and products, we expect some uncertainty on the time of some these fab ramps. Expansion and growth of the semiconductor industry in China could increase the need and demand for our products.
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
Technology Leadership. We are committed to being able to provide our customers with innovative solutions for their manufacturing needs. For example, we have introduced sub-10 nanometer and 7 nanometer filtration products, advanced deposition materials for next generation transistor and interconnect technologies, advanced reticle pods for extreme ultra-violet, or EUV, photolithography applications, advanced 300 mm wafer carriers and advanced coatings to meet the rigorous demands of the advanced technology nodes faced by our customers. As described in further detail below in “Engineering, Research and Development”, this commitment to technology leadership is demonstrated by our ER&D expenditures in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $118.5 million, $107.0 million and $107.0 million, respectively. 
Comprehensive and Diverse Product Offerings. As semiconductor manufacturers are driving towards more advanced technology nodes, our customers are seeking suppliers who can provide a broad range of reliable, flexible and cost-effective products and materials, as well as the technological and application design expertise necessary to enhancing their productivity, quality, and yield. We believe our comprehensive offering of materials and products creates a competitive advantage as it enables us to meet a broad range of customer needs and provide a single source of product offerings for semiconductor device and equipment manufacturers as they seek to consolidate their supplier relationships and pursue advanced technology nodes. Additionally, our broad product and solution portfolio allows us to serve many aspects of the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and to create synergies among certain of our products. For example, our microenvironment and fluidics products are utilized when a fab is being built to move wafers and materials throughout the fab, our chemistries and gas products are consumed during operation of the fab, and our contamination control products ensure the purity of chemistries and gases throughout the fab and its supply chain. 
Global Presence. We have established a global infrastructure of design, manufacturing, distribution, service and technical support facilities to meet the needs of our global customers. We have, for example, expanded our manufacturing operations and increased our investment in advanced technology centers in Taiwan and South Korea to support our important customers in these regions, established new sales and service offices in China and are currently building a technology center in Shanghai, China to serve a growing semiconductor manufacturing base in that country, and expanded our presence in Singapore to enhance our global and regional management of supply chain and manufacturing processes. We service our customer relationships in Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East predominantly via direct sales and support personnel and to a lesser extent through selected independent sales representatives and distributors.
Advanced Manufacturing. We have established leading-edge manufacturing plants located in the United States, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan that possess the advanced manufacturing capabilities described under “Manufacturing” below. 
Strong Relationships with Broad Customer Base. We have strong relationships with our customers, which include leading semiconductor manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and semiconductor materials suppliers. These relationships provide us with significant collaboration opportunities at the product design stage, which facilitate our ability to introduce new products and applications. For example, we work with our key customers in the development of advanced manufacturing processes to identify and respond to their requests for current and future generations of products for emerging applications requiring cleaner materials, as well as systems that maintain the integrity and stability of materials during transport through the manufacturing process. We believe that our customer base will continue to be an important source of new product development opportunities. Due to the specialized nature of our products, manufacturing complexity, qualification requirements in customers’ fabrication processes, high customer re-formulation and qualification change costs, and extensive proprietary products, we believe our supply position with our customers is strong.
Strong Financial Performance and Cash Flow Generation. We have a strong financial profile with net income of $240.8 million, operating margin of 18.9% and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.1% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. In addition to servicing our debt obligations and effecting our capital allocation strategy, we expect that our financial profile will allow us to invest in the research and development and advanced manufacturing capabilities necessary to maintain and expand our technology leadership and to drive organic growth. Additionally, as we have done in the past, we expect that our cash flow generation will enable us to grow inorganically through smaller acquisitions of product lines or technology that expand upon 
4

our product portfolio or through larger acquisitions where we act as a consolidator in the industry and increase our scale and strengthen our position as a leading supplier to our customers. For an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin and a reconciliation to GAAP net income, see “Non-GAAP Information” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
We intend to build upon our position as a leading worldwide developer, manufacturer and supplier of advanced specialty materials, filtration and purification solutions, delivery systems, and materials packaging solutions to expand our core business and to grow in other high value-added manufacturing process markets. Our strategy includes the following key elements:
Commitment to Technology Leadership. We continuously improve our products and develop new products as our customers’ needs evolve. As semiconductor devices become smaller and more powerful, and new materials and processes are deployed to produce them, we seek to expand our technological capabilities by developing advanced products that address the requirements for greater purification, protection and transport of high value-added materials and by developing advanced chemical materials for use in critical fabrication processes. 
Leveraging our Expertise. We leverage our broad expertise across our portfolio of advanced materials, materials handling and purification capabilities to create innovative new solutions to address unmet customer needs. For example, our industry-leading post-CMP cleaning chemistry is developed and manufactured by our SCEM segment, with collaboration from our MC segment, packaged with our ultra clean container and connector system made by our AMH segment, and delivered to the process tools through fluid handling systems also made by our AMH segment. Furthermore, in the process tool, these chemistries may go through one or several purification systems made by our MC segment to eliminate particles and contaminants. Another example of the results of this strategy is our advanced deposition materials business, where we leverage our ability to synthesize unique molecules, our knowledge of how to purify these materials, and our capability to safely transport these materials and deliver them onto the wafer at the highest throughput. We seek to utilize our diverse and unique expertise in areas of increasing importance to semiconductor manufacturers, such as developing advanced materials and ensuring the purity of high-value materials, and our ability to work collaboratively across our three segments, which enables us to quickly and effectively develop optimized and complimentary solutions for our customers.
Operational Excellence. Our strategy is to continue to develop our advanced manufacturing capabilities into a competitive advantage with our customers by focusing on the following priorities:

• | use of manufacturing equipment and facilities incorporating leading-edge technology including advanced cleanroom and cleaning procedures;


• | implementation of standardized manufacturing systems stressing optimization of equipment effectiveness, predictive maintenance, and direct labor productivity;


• | implementation of automated quality systems that provide both process monitoring and process control throughout the manufacturing process as well as predictive quality data to mitigate against potential quality excursions;


• | implementation of supply chain management systems that assure a reliable and responsive supply of high-quality raw materials;


• | conduct of manufacturing operations to assure the safety of our employees and of the individuals using our products; and


• | maintaining an agile manufacturing organization that is capable of rapid design and development of prototypes of new and derivative products, as well as promptly responding to customer feedback concerning prototypes so that we quickly commercialize and ramp production acceptable to our customers.

Continued Focus on Customers. We view the strong relationships we have with our customers, which include leading semiconductor manufacturers, OEMs, and semiconductor materials suppliers, as critical to our long term success. We intend to reinforce and further strengthen these relationships, through, among other things, collaborations and joint development. Customer intimacy enables us to respond rapidly and thoroughly to their manufacturing challenges and enables us to bring forth new products that serve an existing need. 
Adjacent Markets. We leverage our expertise in the semiconductor industry by developing products for other industries that employ similar technologies and production processes and that utilize materials integrity management, high-purity fluids and integrated dispense systems. For example, outside of the semiconductor industry, our products are used in manufacturing processes for flat panel displays, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, optical magnetic storage devices and products for life sciences. We plan to continue to identify and develop products that address needs in adjacent markets. We believe that by utilizing our technology to provide manufacturing solutions across multiple industries, we are able to increase the total available market for our products and reduce, to an extent, our exposure to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry.
5

Strategic Acquisitions, Partnerships and Related Transactions. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and business partnerships that enable us to address gaps in our product offerings, secure new customers, diversify into complementary product markets, broaden our technological capabilities and product offerings, access local or regional markets and achieve benefits of increased scale. For example, in June 2018, we acquired from SAES Getters S.p.A. the SAES Pure Gas business, a leading provider of high-capacity gas purification systems used in semiconductor manufacturing and adjacent markets, which now reports into our Microcontamination Control division, enabling us to offer a complete portfolio of gas purifications solutions for both bulk and specialty gases to our customers. In January 2018, we acquired Particle Sizing Systems, LLC, a company focused on particle sizing instrumentation for liquid applications in both semiconductor and life science industries, which enables customers to perform particle size analysis online and in real time, directly in fluid stream process, preventing costly yield excursions. In April 2017, we acquired the water and chemical filtration product line for microelectronics applications from W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., or Gore, where we acquired a synergistic product line that leverages our existing platform and expands our served markets. Our 2014 acquisition of ATMI, Inc., or ATMI, brought a whole new portfolio of technologies and materials products to serve our semiconductor customers. Further, as the dynamics of the markets that we serve shift, we will reevaluate our existing businesses and in the event that we conclude that a business is not able to provide value-added solutions to its markets in a manner that contributes to achieving our financial objectives, we expect to restructure or replace that business, such as the sale of our small cleaning business in France. Finally, we are continuously evaluating opportunities for strategic alliances, such as our strategic alliance with Enthone, joint development programs and collaborative marketing efforts with key customers and other industry leaders. For example, in connection with our strategic commitment to support the growing semiconductor and related microelectronics industries in China, in 2017, we entered into agreements with local partners to expand our capability to manufacture our specialty chemical and deposition products locally and shorten our supply chain for our customers in China. 
OUR SEGMENTS
As discussed, our business is organized and operated in three operating segments which align with the key elements of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem: Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials, or SCEM; Microcontamination Control, or MC; and Advanced Materials Handling, or AMH. We leverage our expertise from these three segments to create new and increasingly integrated solutions for our customers. The following is a detailed description of our three segments:
SPECIALTY CHEMICALS AND ENGINEERED MATERIALS SEGMENT
The SCEM segment provides high-performance and high-purity process chemistries, gases, and materials that enable enhanced device performance. These materials are utilized in critical semiconductor manufacturing processes such as deposition, cleaning, and integration of complex materials. Advanced materials, delivered at high purity, are critical to enabling the performance of leading-edge logic and memory applications.  We believe the growing demand in the 3D-NAND market, challenges with metallization schemes and the need for specialized cleaning solutions will drive consumption for materials in our SCEM segment. In conjunction with products from our MC and AMH segments, the materials in our SCEM segment provide unique solutions to safely and efficiently deliver critical materials to support semiconductor and other advanced manufacturing processes. 
Specialty Gas Products. Our specialty gas solutions provide advanced safety and process capabilities to semiconductor, display and solar panel manufacturers. Our SDS cylinders store and deliver hazardous gases, such as arsine, phosphine, germanium tetrafluoride and boron trifluoride, at sub-atmospheric pressure through the use of our proprietary carbon-based adsorbent materials. These products minimize potential leaks during transportation and use and allow more gas to be stored in the cylinder, features which provide significant safety, environmental and productivity benefits over traditional high-pressure cylinders. New generations of SDS products further increase the gas storage capacity, reducing tool down time, therefore, resulting in significant cost savings for our customers. We also offer VAC, a complementary technology to SDS, where select implant gases and gas mixtures are stored under high pressure but delivered sub-atmospherically.
Specialty Materials Products. Our specialty materials include specialized graphite, silicon carbide, thermally conductive foam and a variety of unique, high purity coatings for dry or plasma etch, chemical vapor deposition and ion implant applications. Our POCO® premium graphite is used to make precision consumable electrodes for electrical discharge machining, hot glass contact materials for glass product manufacturing and forming, and other consumable products for various industrial applications, including aerospace, optical, medical devices, air bearings and printing. Our high-performance specialty coatings, such as our Pegasus™ and our latest development Cearus™ coatings, provide erosion resistance, minimize particle generation and prevent contamination on critical components in semiconductor environments and other high-technology manufacturing operations. Our specialty materials provide customized solutions for applications challenged with unique temperature, corrosive, chemical or process environments, such as electrostatic chucks used to hold wafers during processing, plasma etch chamber components, aircraft bearings, and ultrasonic transducers.
6

Advanced Deposition Materials Products. Our advanced deposition materials include advanced liquid, gaseous and solid precursors which are incorporated in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes by the semiconductor industry, including organometallic precursors for the deposition of tungsten, titanium, cobalt and aluminum containing films and organosilane precursors for the deposition of silicon oxide and silicon nitride films. These precursors are designed in close collaboration with OEM process tool manufacturers as well as device makers to produce application specific solutions that are compatible with complex integrations of material solutions used to build the semiconductor device. We offer containers that allow for reliable storage and delivery of low volatility solid and liquid precursors required in ALD processes. When combined with our proprietary corrosion resistant coatings and filtration solutions from our MC segment, our advanced deposition materials enable the industry’s highest purity levels, resulting in improved device performance.
Surface Preparation and Integration Products. We offer a range of materials used to prepare the surface of a semiconductor wafer during the manufacturing process and to integrate with materials being used on the wafer. We also provide advanced plating solutions, such as our Viaform® product (a trademark of and exclusively licensed from Enthone Inc., or Enthone, a subsidiary of Platform Specialty Products Corporation), which includes inorganic and proprietary organic molecules that provide the wiring for copper interconnects. We also offer CMP cleaning solutions for applications such as semiconductor post-etch residue removal, wafer etching, organics removal, negative resist removal, edge bead removal, and corrosion prevention. Our wet chemistries solutions, combined with filtration solutions from our MC segment and fluid handling solutions from our AMH segment, provide enhanced purity, which results in improvements in our customers’ processes. Our consumable PVA roller brush products are used to clean the wafer following the CMP process and our pad conditioners, based on our silicon carbide capabilities, lengthen CMP pad life.
MICROCONTAMINATION CONTROL SEGMENT
The MC segment offers solutions to purify critical liquid chemistries and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries. The design and performance of our liquid and gas filtration and purification products are important to the semiconductor manufacturing process because they remove contamination and directly reduce defects and improve manufacturing yield. Our proprietary filters remove organic and inorganic nanometer-sized contaminants from the different fluids and gases used in the manufacturing process, including photolithography, deposition, planarization and surface etching and cleaning. As our customers leverage leading edge lithography tools and multi-patterning technology to enable each subsequent generation of products, our filtration and purification products are utilized to achieve necessary levels of purity and contamination control. We believe demand for purification and filtration products is being driven by the continuous node shrink in logic semiconductors and the ramp in the 3D-NAND market, as the risk of yield loss grows with the incremental manufacturing steps needed for the production of these devices. We utilize expertise from the AMH segment in polymer science and from the SCEM segment in chemical manufacturing to develop differentiated filtration and purification solutions for our customers. 
Liquid Microcontamination Control Products. We offer a variety of unique products that are optimized to control contaminants in our customers’ liquid processes. For example, our Torrento® series of filters is used for the filtration of aggressive acid and base chemistries for both semiconductor fabs as well as specialty chemical manufacturers including our SCEM segment. Manufacturers of high purity chemicals as well as semiconductor fabs use our Trinzik® products for the filtration of chemicals as well as ultra-pure water. Our Impact® series of filters are used in point-of-use photochemical dispense applications, including those provided by our AMH segment, where the delivery of superior flow rate performance and reduced microbubble formation is critical.
Gas Microcontamination Control Products. We offer a complete portfolio of products designed to remove particulate and molecular contaminates from gas streams from the point of creation on the gas pads to the point of use at the wafer in semiconductor, flat panel display and LED fabs. In addition, we provide products used to eliminate airborne molecular contamination from critical process tool areas or cleanrooms in the fab. Our Waferguard® gas filters reduce outgassing and remove particle contamination. Our GateKeeper® gas purifiers and large facility wide gas purification systems provide continuous purified gas supply to customer fabs by chemically reacting and absorbing contaminants, effectively removing gaseous contaminants down to part-per-trillion levels. Our Chambergard™ gas diffusers provide semiconductor equipment manufacturers with the capability to rapidly vent their tools to atmosphere to dramatically reduce process cycle times without adding particles to the wafers. These products are used in, or alongside, critical processing tools to improve yield and reduce tool downtime. In addition, we provide filters used to eliminate airborne molecular contamination from critical process tool areas or cleanrooms in the fab, improving process yield.
ADVANCED MATERIALS HANDLING SEGMENT
The AMH segment develops solutions to monitor, protect, transport, and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers and substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor industry and other high-technology industries. These systems and products improve our customers’ yields by protecting wafers from abrasion, degradation and contamination during 
7

manufacturing and transportation and by assuring the consistent, clean and safe delivery of advanced chemicals from the chemical manufacturer to the point-of-use in the semiconductor fab. As advanced semiconductor fabs are built, demand is driven for our wafer handling and fluid handling products. As those fabs move into production, we see demand for wafer carrying and fluid containment solutions offered by this segment. The AMH segment collaborates closely with the semiconductor chemical manufacturers segment in developing products that are compatible with advanced chemistries to enhance yield, and integrates liquid filtration technology from our MC segment to deliver consistent and pure chemistry.
Wafer Solutions. We lead the market with our high-volume line of Ultrapak® and Crystalpak® products for wafers ranging from 100 to 200 mm, which ensure the clean and secure transport of wafers from the wafer manufacturers to the semiconductor fab. We also offer a front-opening shipping box, or FOSB, for the transportation and automated interface of 300 mm wafers. We lead the market for 300mm front opening unified pods, or FOUPs, wafer transport and process carriers, and standard mechanical interface pods, or SMIF pods, for 200mm wafer applications. These microenvironment products safely and accurately deliver wafers within the semiconductor fab environment to the various process fabrication steps. We are a leader in reticle protection products for photolithography. This includes products that protect the high-value EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography masks during both the mask manufacturing process and their use in the semiconductor fab.
Chemical Containers. We have a broad portfolio of flexible and rigid polymer packaging and container products, from low-volume containers to transport high-value photoresist chemistries, such as our NOWPak® products, to large intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) to safely and efficiently transport chemicals in bulk, such as our FluoroPure® products. Our connection systems provide for safe and efficient chemical dispense from the container in the fab. Chemical companies utilize our packaging products to ensure the purity of chemistries shipped to semiconductor fabs, resulting in enhance yields. 
Fluidics.

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
As of December 31, 2018, we own approximately 2,284 active patents worldwide, of which about 644 are United States patents. Additionally, Entegris owns about 1,098 that are pending patent applications globally. In addition, we license certain patents owned by third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and license agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We refresh our intellectual property on an ongoing basis through continued innovation. While we license and will continue to license technology used in the manufacture and distribution of products from third parties, we do not consider any particular patent or license to be material to our business. 
We vigorously protect and defend our intellectual property. We require each of our employees, including our executive officers, to enter into standard agreements pursuant to which the employee agrees to keep confidential all of our proprietary information and to assign to us all inventions made while employed by us. We also require all outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors and consultants who are provided confidential information to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of the consulting or collaboration relationship in question. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity’s or individual’s relationship with the Company is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances.
MANUFACTURING
Our customers rely on our products and materials to assure the integrity of the critical materials used in their manufacturing processes by providing purity, cleanliness, consistent performance, dimensional precision and stability. Our ability to meet our customers’ expectations, combined with our substantial investments in worldwide manufacturing capacity, position us to respond to the increasing demands from our customers for yield-enhancing materials and solutions.
To meet our customers’ needs worldwide, we have established an extensive global manufacturing network with facilities in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and South Korea.

In addition, we use contract manufacturers for certain of our gas purification systems and certain electronic materials products both in the U.S. and Asia.
RAW MATERIALS
Our products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from multiple sources of supply. However, while we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials, certain materials included in our products, such as certain filtration membranes in our MC segment, petroleum coke and specialty and commodity chemicals in our SCEM segment and polymer resins in our AMH segment, are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers or from suppliers in a single country. We have entered into multi-year supply agreements with a number of suppliers for the purchase of raw materials in the interest of supply assurance and to control costs.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of contaminants, hazardous substances and wastes, as well as practices and procedures applicable to the construction and operation of our plants. Although some risk of costs and liabilities related to these matters is inherent in our business, as with many similar businesses, we believe that our business is operated in substantial compliance with applicable regulations. However, new, modified or more stringent requirements or enforcement policies could be adopted, which could adversely affect us. While we expect that capital expenditures will be necessary to assure that any new manufacturing facility is in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws, we do not expect these expenditures to be material.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,900 employees. Given the variability of business cycles in the semiconductor industry and the quick response time required by our customers, it is critical that we be able to quickly adjust the size of our production staff to maximize efficiency. Therefore, we use skilled temporary labor as required.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement other than statutorily mandated programs in certain European countries.
