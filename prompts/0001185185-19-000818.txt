Item 1.  BUSINESS
 
(a)  General Description of Business
 
We are the exclusive United States trade co-publisher of educational children’s books produced in the United Kingdom by Usborne Publishing Limited (“Usborne”) and we also exclusively publish books through our ownership of Kane Miller Book Publisher (“Kane Miller”); both award-winning publishers of international children’s books.  We are a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 23, 1965. Our fiscal year ends on February 28 (29).
 
Our Company motto is “The future of our world depends on the education of our children.  EDC delivers educational excellence one book at a time.  We provide economic opportunity while fostering strong family values.  We touch the lives of children for a lifetime.”
 
(b)  Financial Information about Our Segments
 
While selling children’s books and related products (collectively referred to as “books”) is our only line of business, we sell them through two business segments, which we sometimes refer to as “divisions”:

● | Home Business Division (“Usborne Books & More” or “UBAM”) – This division sells our books through independent consultants directly to our customers. Our consultants sell books by hosting home parties, through social media collaboration platforms on the internet, by hosting book fairs with school and public libraries and through other events.

● | Publishing Division (“EDC Publishing” or “Publishing”) – This division sells our books to bookstores (including major national chains), toy stores, specialty stores, museums and other retail outlets throughout the country.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business
 
Products
 
As the exclusive United States trade co-publisher of the Usborne books and sole publisher of Kane Miller books, we offer over 2,000 different children’s books.  Many of our books are interactive in nature, including our Touchy-Feely board books, activity and flashcards, adventure and search books, art books, sticker books and foreign language books.  Most of our books were originally published in other countries, in their native languages, and we translate them to common American English and have exclusive rights to publish the titles in the United States.
 
 We have a broad line of ‘internet-linked’ books which allow readers to expand their educational experience by referring them to relevant non-Company websites.  Our books include science and math titles, as well as chapter books and novels.  We continually introduce new titles across all lines of our products.
 
UBAM markets the books through commissioned consultants using a combination of direct sales, home parties, book fairs and internet based social media party plans.  The division had approximately 31,800 active consultants at February 28, 2019.
 
Our Publishing division markets through commissioned trade representatives who call on retail book, toy, and specialty stores along with other retail outlets. Publishing also conducts in-house marketing by telephone to these customers and potential customers.  This division markets to approximately 4,000 book, toy and specialty stores. Approximately 14% of our Publishing division's net sales, are to national chain stores.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales for both divisions are greatest during the fall due to the holiday season.
 
Competition
 
While we have the exclusive U.S. rights to sell Usborne Books and our Kane Miller published books, we face competition from the internet and other book publishers who are also selling directly to our customers.  Our UBAM division competes in recruiting and retaining sales consultants, which continuously receive opportunities to work for larger direct selling companies, as well as new non-traditional employment opportunities in the gig-marketplace that provide part time supplemental income. We also compete with Scholastic Books in the school and library book fair market.
 
Our Publishing division faces competition from large U.S. and international publishing companies.
 
Employees
 
As of May 22, 2019, 178 full-time employees worked at our Tulsa office and distribution facility and at our San Diego office.  Of these employees, approximately 63% of our employees work in our distribution warehouse. 
Company Reports
 
We make available, free of charge, on our website (www.edcpub.com) copies of our Annual Reports, Quarterly Reports, Current Reports on Form 8-K, amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and reports of holdings of our securities filed by our officers and directors under Section 16 of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the SEC.
