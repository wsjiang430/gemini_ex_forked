 Overview
Our mission is to build and enable the most trusted and efficient digital marketplaces for buying and selling used vehicles with transparency and comprehensive data that was previously unimaginable.
We provide a vibrant digital marketplace for wholesale vehicle transactions and data services that offer transparent and accurate vehicle information to our customers. Our platform leverages data insights and technology to power our digital marketplace and data services, enabling our dealers and commercial partners to buy, sell, and value vehicles with confidence and efficiency. We strive to solve the challenges that the used automotive industry has faced for generations and provide powerful technology-enabled capabilities to our dealers and commercial partners who fulfill a critical role in the automotive ecosystem. We help dealers source and manage inventory and accurately price their vehicles as well as process payments, transfer titles and manage arbitrations, and finance and transport vehicles. Our platform encompasses:
•Digital Marketplace. Connects buyers and sellers of wholesale vehicles in an intuitive and efficient manner. Our core marketplace offering is a 20-minute live auction which facilitates instant transactions of wholesale vehicles, and is accessible across multiple platforms including mobile apps, web, and directly through our application programming interface (API) integration. We also offer transportation, financing and assurance services to facilitate the entire transaction journey. 
 •Data Services. Offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles for transactions both on and off our marketplace and help dealers, their end consumers, and commercial partners make more informed decisions to transact with confidence and efficiency. We enable dealers to accurately price wholesale and retail inventory while maximizing profit on each vehicle sold by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning. 
 •Data and Technology. Underpins everything we do, and powers our vehicle inspections, comprehensive vehicle intelligence reports, digital marketplace, and operations automation platform. 
 We power our marketplace with technology-driven products and value-added services that address the entire transaction journey, ranging from pre-inspection scheduling to post-auction services including title transferability verification, payment processing, financing, and transportation, and facilitate transactions both on and off our marketplace. Our comprehensive suite of services include ACV Transportation, ACV Capital, and our Customer Assurance (Go Green), which help create a seamless and frictionless buying and selling experience for our customers to further enhance our digital marketplace. We also provide data services to our customers for use outside of our marketplace. Our True360 Reports are used by dealers and commercial partners to provide transparent vehicle information to potential buyers, including dealers as well as consumers. Our Max Digital inventory management system enables dealers to accurately price their wholesale and retail inventory. We believe the data and technology services enabled by our platform can bring value to the entire automotive industry and transform both wholesale and retail markets.
Our platform benefits from a virtuous cycle driven by our scaled, digital marketplace and the data and technology we leverage every day. More buyers and sellers engaging on our marketplace drives greater liquidity and greater vehicle selection, which leads to an overall better marketplace experience. This leads to greater scale, driving more vehicle and market data that helps grow our data and technology moat. As we collect more vehicle and market data, we are able to provide greater efficiency to buyers and sellers through more products, which in turn drives greater marketplace supply and scale. For example, our data and technology enables economies of scale that improve our value-added transportation and financing services. As we continue to grow and offer more comprehensive and efficient services, our customers can further benefit from a more streamlined, simple, and consistent experience across the full used vehicle lifecycle. These reinforcing flywheel effects continuously improve our scaled, digital marketplace, and data and technology for our customers, resulting in growth for our platform.
 We continue to invest in growth to scale our company responsibly and drive towards profitability.

Our Platform
Our platform leverages data and technology to power our digital marketplace and data services, enabling our dealers and commercial partners to buy, sell, and value vehicles with confidence and efficiency. Our digital marketplace offerings include our core auction offering and value-added services, ACV Transportation, ACV Capital, and our Customer Assurance (Go Green). Our data services provide insights into the condition and value of used vehicles for transactions both on and off our marketplace. Our core data and technology platform includes offerings such as inspection, vehicle intelligence, marketplace enablement, and operations automation.
Digital Marketplace
Our digital marketplace connects buyers and sellers of wholesale vehicles nationwide, enabling them to transact intuitively and efficiently.
•Auction. Our core offering is our online auction, which facilitates instant transactions of wholesale vehicles. Thousands of dealers transact every day, with sellers either launching their vehicles directly to our 20-minute live auction or to Run List, which is a digital list that gives buyers the chance to view the condition report and place proxy bids 24 hours before the auction goes live. When sellers launch their vehicles directly to our online auction, buyers can search and discover relevant inventory through customized filters, such as price, location, and vehicle-specific details including mileage, year, make, and model. 
 •Run List. Run List supports dealers in making informed decisions. It allows for pre-filtering and pre-screening of vehicles up to 24 hours prior to an auction taking place. This allows dealers the time to thoroughly review vehicle data and insights and focus their searches.
 •ACV Transportation. Through our nationwide network of third-party carrier partners, our technology platform, and dedicated service teams, we enable the movement of vehicles both locally and long-haul in a cost-efficient and timely manner. All buyers on our platform have the ability to see real-time transportation quotes as part of the vehicle-display page and add transportation services during checkout. Once the transaction is finalized, dealers will receive a confirmation email and have access to status reports on MyACV to follow the vehicle on its journey to its new dealer. 
 •ACV Capital. We offer short-term inventory financing (otherwise known as floorplan loans) for buyers to purchase vehicles on our digital marketplace. Our financing product includes straightforward pricing with no hidden costs, allowing our customers to know their inventory costs upfront. 
 •Customer Assurance (Go Green). We provide the seller with a Go Green assurance against claims related to defects in the vehicle which we did not identify in our condition report and otherwise may have exposed the seller to loss as a result of arbitration with the buyer. We believe Go Green's seller assurance service instills more confidence in dealers and commercial partners to transact digitally.
 Data Services
We offer data services for our dealer and commercial partners that bring transparency and offer insights into the condition and value of used vehicles, enabling them to make more informed wholesale and retail inventory management decisions both on and off our digital marketplace.
•True360 Report. We provide proprietary, vehicle-specific intelligence, including cosmetic and structural vehicle assessments that can be integrated into leading vehicle history report providers. This data helps our dealers and commercial partners buy and sell vehicles and accurately assess and document vehicle condition. Dealers utilize the True360 Report to make wholesale and retail transaction decisions with confidence both on and off our marketplace. The True360 Reports can be used with leading vehicle history report providers, such as CarFax and AutoCheck, to increase transparency. Commercial partners use our detailed and marketable True360 commercial inspection reports to better price and sell their used vehicle inventory. 
 •ACV Market Report. We provide transaction data and condition reports for comparable used vehicles, including pricing data from third-party sources. With a full picture of how previous vehicle sales have performed, our ACV Market Report gives dealers another tool to determine pricing and valuation strategies for used vehicles. The report provides a range from the low value to high value of the year, make, and model sold on the platform, and will list all of the vehicle’s information including location, date, mileage and sold price. Dealers can utilize filters to further narrow down results in order to get the best picture to assess the pricing strategy for that particular vehicle.
 •MAX Digital. Through our inventory management software offering, we enable dealers to manage their inventory and set pricing more effectively while turning vehicles faster and maximizing profit by leveraging predictive analytics informed by machine learning and market data.
 Data and Technology
Data and technology are the foundations of our platform and underpin everything we do. Our core data and technology capabilities include inspection, vehicle intelligence, marketplace enablement, and operations automation.
•Inspection
•Condition Report. Our platform enables thorough, comprehensive inspections and reports that feature approximately 100 details such as cosmetic irregularities including paint quality, as well as structural assessments that identify prior repairs or existing damages. For the cosmetic and structural analysis, our inspectors complete metering of all paint surfaces to help identify irregularities in paint quality and assess the structure of the vehicle to identify prior repairs or existing damages. Inspectors also use drivetrain and mechanical analyses to read and clear diagnostic trouble codes, and identify potential resolutions for them. For interior and exterior reviews, inspectors complete a detailed evaluation of the vehicle, ranging from the cupholder and gauge, to the tires.
 •Virtual Lift. We offer a high definition look at a vehicle’s undercarriage without having to put the vehicle on a lift through Virtual Lift. This is a portable, light-weight, drive-over solution utilizing mobile device technology that can be operated by a single inspector in a matter of minutes. Virtual Lift elevates the level of trust and transparency on our digital marketplace by providing a digital look into a vehicle’s undercarriage. 
 •Apex. Apex is a proprietary and patent-pending wireless suite of data-gathering sensors. This new application-driven device utilizes a multi-microphone array to capture higher quality engine sound recordings as compared to our previous data-gathering sensor AMP. This allows for real-time sharing of a vehicle’s engine sound and combines this data with information and inputs from a host of other sensors, including but not limited to non-audible range acoustics, vibration, atmospheric, VOC, and gyroscopic data. The enhanced audio signature is not only designed to give buyers the highest quality listening experience in the industry it is also customized to be compatible with our engine fault detection machine learning models. Utilizing and building upon our existing AMP advanced machine learning algorithms, we leverage our extensive vehicle database to provide guided insights on vehicle engine conditions at the time of inspection. The Apex sensor platforms are compatible with multiple of ACV's built applications and can be utilized using iOS and Android-powered devices.

•Vehicle Intelligence. Our platform is fueled by the data we collect through our proprietary technology, inspections, and activity on our marketplace, as well as third-party market data. We store, analyze, and connect this data to create comprehensive analytics tailored for our dealers and commercial partners. Our pricing engine utilizes our extensive repository of data to help predict wholesale and retail vehicle valuations at scale, and dealers can price any vehicle anywhere.
 •Marketplace Enablement
•MyACV. We provide an application that serves as our customers’ gateway to our platform through our mobile app, website, or directly leveraging our APIs. MyACV offers user-friendly product features for our customers including personalization, inventory discovery, bidding, purchasing, finalization of post-sale payment options, and additional services including transportation and financing. Our navigation feature accommodates a constantly increasing list of new capabilities, like the Data Export feature that allows dealers to download won, sold, and saved auction details.
 •Private Marketplaces. Our private marketplace offering powers private sales for dealer groups and commercial partners, permitting the customization of participants, schedule and duration, bidding, purchasing, and pricing rules. Our customers are able to curate and customize their audience, auction schedule and duration, and bid policy, among other items, in a co-branded interface.
 •Operations Automation. Investments in our technology platform have unlocked process workflow optimization and automation for pre- and post-auction services. Our configurable and integrated services support payment processing, risk management, processing of titles by a dedicated ACV team or automated through machine learning, arbitration, and transportation services. 
 •Live Appraisal. Through live appraisals, we enabled dealers to quickly assess the value of potential trade-in vehicles from consumers.
 •Programmatic Buying. Programmatic buying experience, driven by data from our industry-leading condition reports, allows our customers with compatible technology platforms to integrate directly with ACV's real-time APIs to generate bids on our marketplace. In addition, our new programmatic buying user experience enables the rest of our dealer partners to participate in programmatic buying on our marketplace by creating inventory wish lists to automatically source their inventory needs.
 Key Advantages to our Platform
Our competitive advantage results from our deep expertise in the used vehicle market, a transparent, digital approach for our dealers and commercial partners, and a comprehensive suite of products and services:
Transparent, Digital Approach Unlocks a More Efficient Market. Our digital marketplace and comprehensive suite of products and services provides greater access to trusted inventory and speed to liquidity for our dealers and commercial partners. Our differentiated approach to vehicle insights also allows us to stand behind vehicles listed on our marketplace and truly partner with our customers. We pioneered what we believe to be the wholesale market’s first seller assurance service, Go Green, which provides the seller with an assurance against claims of defects in the vehicle that are not disclosed in our condition report and which otherwise may have exposed the seller to loss as a result of arbitration with the vehicle buyer. We believe our approach instills more confidence for our customers to transact digitally and we enable transactions that may not have happened in the traditional auction process.
Industry Leading Digital Marketplace with Significant Scale. The power of our platform is evidenced through our scale and growth. In 2022, we had 14,453 active Marketplace Buyers and 10,285 active Marketplace Sellers generating $9.0 billion Marketplace GMV, which increased by 3%, 14%, and 13%, respectively, from the prior year. Our digital marketplace provides sellers with an efficient channel to wholesale their vehicles and access to thousands of dealers nationwide, and provides buyers with a real-time view of extensive vehicle inventory, all at the touch of a button. We believe our ability to build vibrant local and regional networks of Marketplace Buyers and Marketplace Sellers, combined with our nationwide coverage, creates a strong competitive advantage.
Comprehensive Suite of Products and Services Deepening Relationships with Our Customers. We offer a comprehensive suite of products and services that help create a seamless experience and remove the friction and pain points associated with the traditional wholesale process. Through services such as ACV Transportation and ACV Capital, we help our customers manage the entire transaction journey on our platform, becoming an integral partner and deepening our relationships with them.
Growing Technology and Data Moat. Our growing repository of data enables transparent, comprehensive, and accurate vehicle information that our customers can trust, powering more efficient and frictionless vehicle transactions both on and off our marketplace. Through the connection of hundreds of discrete data points collected along the entire used vehicle transaction journey, we improve existing products and react dynamically to our customers’ needs.
Attractive Territory Economics. As our territories mature and scale, territory-level economics tend to improve driven by more cost-efficient operations and greater customer affinity for our offerings. As we reach greater scale and higher levels of density in a territory, we typically experience lower inspection cost per vehicle and better overall economics per transaction.
Mission-Driven Culture and Proven Team. We believe the happiness of our teammates leads to successful business operations, and comes from learning and engaging in fulfilling work, which results in ample professional growth opportunities. Additionally, we represent the successful creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem in our hometown, and our success enables us to attract some of the best talent in the region and across the country. Our leadership team is composed of seasoned executives with demonstrated track records of scaling businesses across auto, consumer, and marketplace companies.
Sales
Our sales team is responsible for onboarding our dealers and commercial partners and ensuring their success and satisfaction on our platform. We have built a robust internal sales team that act as account managers, and partner with our customers. Account managers are often the first point of contact for customers seeking to join our platform, and develop meaningful relationships with our dealers and commercial partners. We also have a dedicated sales development team that proactively sources new customers, particularly for our more nascent territories or in existing territories where we seek to improve our buyer to seller ratio. After dealers are on-boarded onto our platform, they can interact with their account managers through in-app messaging, by email, or by phone.
Our territory managers also function as sales representatives, particularly in more nascent territories where they develop personal relationships with local dealers. When launching and entering new territories, our dedicated on the ground team, including territory managers, VCIs, and other operations staff, target and onboard dealers in the respective territory with an appropriate balance of buyers and sellers to encourage vibrancy in the marketplace. Territory managers continue to support our dealers, building awareness of our brand in the regions in which they operate. Our VCIs serve as a sales support team by building and cultivating relationships with our customers through multiple weekly visits to customers in their territories. Given the strength of their relationships and frequency of interaction with our dealers, VCIs often double as informal relationship managers and can be a key point of contact for dealers on our platform.
Marketing
We build and cultivate relationships with our dealer and commercial partners, with the goal of providing a streamlined, simple, and consistent experience for our customers. Marketing campaigns and promotions are used throughout the transaction journey to guide the customer through the funnel, cross-sell offerings and ultimately reach their full volume potential with ACV.
Our marketing initiatives aim to drive brand awareness, incentivize our existing partners to remain engaged and active in our marketplace, and attract new dealers and commercial partners to our platform. We are focused on building a world-class acquisition engine led by our marketing team and in partnership with our VCIs, business development representatives and account managers. Our customer acquisition efforts are strategically aligned to territories or regions that could benefit from dealer development. We are focused on increasing retention and growing wallet share with our customers.
We acquire new customers through a variety of marketing channels including digital (e.g. paid search, search engine optimization, display, social, video and influencer marketing), direct marketing (e.g. promotional and brand building) and outbound business development. The marketing and business development teams own the customer relationship from initial inquiry to sign-up. After onboarding they are assigned a dedicated account manager or territory manager for on-going support. Engagement with our customers is driven by ongoing and regular communications from their account managers or territory managers. Additionally, account managers and territory managers determine appropriate promotions to re-engage buyers and sellers, as well as an incentive for new customers to sign-up and engage.
Competition
We mainly compete with large, national physical vehicle auction companies, such as Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., Adesa, a subsidiary of Carvana, and KAR Auction Services. The physical vehicle auction market in North America is largely consolidated, with Manheim and Adesa serving as large players in the market. Manheim has expanded into online wholesale marketplaces and auctions, and KAR Auction Services is also competing in the online wholesale auction market. However, we do compete with smaller chains of auctions and independent auctions in the physical market. We also compete with a number of smaller digital marketplace companies.
Human Capital and Culture
We believe the development and empowerment of our people is critical to our ability to deliver differentiated solutions to our customers. We strive to be a great place to work—a place where we welcome innovation, diversity, inclusion, and foster a spirit of community from our corporate headquarters to our teammates in the field. We give our teammates the freedom, tools, resources, and opportunity to build the future—for our company, our customers, and our communities. We hire happy and enthusiastic people who want to grow with us. We believe the happiness of our teammates comes from engaging and fulfilling work and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities. We strive to ensure that all of our teammates have what they need to get to where they want to be, and we try our best to make it fun along the way. We invest heavily in the development of our teammates through training, internal development, and mobility options to drive growth. Together with respect, empowerment, and the spirit of innovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.
We represent the successful creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem in our hometown and our growth and scale highlight that the spirit of innovation is alive and well in Buffalo, New York. We are continuously building an exceptional culture that strives to drive engagement, exceed expectations, and directly impact company success.
We have a proven leadership team composed of seasoned executives with demonstrated track records of scaling businesses, as well as business leaders from across auto, consumer, and marketplace businesses. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 2,000 teammates, including our more than over 760 highly sophisticated VCIs that help support our relationships with our customers nationwide.
 Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of federal, state, common law and international legal rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties. We pursue the registration of our trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and third parties. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to access, copy, obtain, use, reverse engineer, misappropriate, infringe, and otherwise violate our technology and intellectual property, including to develop platforms with the same functionality as our platform. For more information regarding the risks relating to intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property.”
Seasonality
 The volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors, including holidays, weather, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles and the timing of federal tax returns, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. As a result, revenue and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. In the fourth quarter, we typically experience lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays. Seasonally depressed used vehicle auction volume typically continues during the winter months through the beginning of the first quarter. Typical seasonality trends may not be observed in periods where other external factors more significantly impact the industry.
Our Government Regulations
The industry in which we operate is and will continue to be subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. The wholesale, financing and transportation of used vehicles are regulated by the states in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. These laws can vary significantly from state to state. In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce and the collection, storage, processing, transfer and other use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to federal and state laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and prohibitions again unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
In addition to these laws and regulations, our facilities and business operations are subject to a wide array of federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, data privacy and security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. For additional information, see “Risk Factors-Risk Factors Related to Government Regulation and Litigation—We operate in highly regulated industries and either are or may be subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may force us to change our operations or harm our business.”
