Item 1. Business.
Introduction
The Wendy’s Company (“The Wendy’s Company”) is the parent company of its 100% owned subsidiary holding company Wendy’s Restaurants, LLC (“Wendy’s Restaurants”). Wendy’s Restaurants is the parent company of Wendy’s International, LLC, formerly known as Wendy’s International, Inc. Wendy’s International, LLC is the indirect parent company of Quality Is Our Recipe, LLC (“Quality”), which is the owner and franchisor of the Wendy’s® restaurant system in the United States. As used in this report, unless the context requires otherwise, the term “Company” refers to The Wendy’s Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and “Wendy’s” refers to Quality when the context relates to ownership of or franchising the Wendy’s restaurant system and to Wendy’s International, LLC when the context refers to the Wendy’s brand.
As of December 30, 2018, the Wendy’s restaurant system was comprised of 6,711 restaurants, of which 353 were owned and operated by the Company. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”) to restaurants that we “own” or that are “Company-operated” include owned and leased restaurants. The Wendy’s Company’s corporate predecessor was incorporated in Ohio in 1929 and was reincorporated in Delaware in June 1994. Effective September 29, 2008, in conjunction with the merger with Wendy’s, the Company’s corporate name was changed from Triarc Companies, Inc. (“Triarc”) to Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. (“Wendy’s/Arby’s”). Effective July 5, 2011, in connection with the sale of Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Arby’s”), Wendy’s/Arby’s changed its name to The Wendy’s Company. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at One Dave Thomas Blvd., Dublin, Ohio 43017, and its telephone number is (614) 764-3100. We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to such reports, as well as our annual proxy statement, available, free of charge, on the Investor Relations portion of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also provide our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, free of charge, on our website. Our website address is www.wendys.com/who-we-are. Information contained on that website is not part of this Form 10-K.
Merger with Wendy’s
On September 29, 2008, Triarc and Wendy’s completed their merger (the “Wendy’s Merger”) in an all-stock transaction in which Wendy’s shareholders received 4.25 shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A common stock for each Wendy’s common share owned. In the Wendy’s Merger, approximately 377,000,000 shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s Class A common stock were issued to Wendy’s shareholders. In addition, effective on the date of the Wendy’s Merger, Wendy’s/Arby’s Class B common stock was converted into Class A common stock. In connection with the May 28, 2009 amendment and restatement of Wendy’s/Arby’s Certificate of Incorporation, Class A common stock was redesignated as “Common Stock.”
Sale of Arby’s
On July 4, 2011, Wendy’s Restaurants completed the sale of 100% of the common stock of Arby’s to ARG IH Corporation (“ARG”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARG Holding Corporation (“ARG Parent”), for $130.0 million in cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 18.5% of the common stock of ARG Parent (through which Wendy’s Restaurants indirectly retained an 18.5% interest in Arby’s). Our 18.5% equity interest was diluted to 12.3% on February 5, 2018, when a subsidiary of ARG Parent acquired Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. As a result, our diluted ownership interest included both the Arby’s® and Buffalo Wild Wings® brands under the newly formed combined company, Inspire Brands, Inc. (“Inspire Brands”). On August 16, 2018, the Company sold its remaining 12.3% ownership interest to Inspire Brands for $450.0 million. (Arby’s is a registered trademark of Arby’s IP Holder, LLC and Buffalo Wild Wings is a registered trademark of Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc.) 
Fiscal Year
The Company’s fiscal reporting periods consist of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday closest to December 31 and are referred to herein as (1) “the year ended December 30, 2018” or “2018,” (2) “the year ended December 31, 2017” or “2017” and (3) “the year ended January 1, 2017” or “2016,” all of which consisted of 52 weeks.

Business Segments
The Company manages and internally reports its business geographically. The operation and franchising of Wendy’s restaurants in North America (defined as the United States and Canada) comprises virtually all of our current operations and represents a single reportable segment. The revenues and operating results of Wendy’s restaurants outside of North America are not material. See Note 25 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for financial information attributable to our geographic areas.
The Wendy’s Restaurant System
Wendy’s is the world’s third largest quick-service restaurant company in the hamburger sandwich segment.
Wendy’s is primarily engaged in the business of operating, developing and franchising a system of distinctive quick-service restaurants serving high quality food. At December 30, 2018, there were 6,178 Wendy’s restaurants in operation in North America. Of these restaurants, 353 were operated by the Company and 5,825 were operated by a total of 330 franchisees. In addition, at December 30, 2018, there were 533 franchised Wendy’s restaurants in operation in 30 countries and territories other than North America. See “Item 2. Properties” herein for a listing of the number of Company-operated and franchised locations in the United States and in foreign countries and United States territories.
The revenues from our restaurant business are derived from two principal sources: (1) sales at Company-operated restaurants and (2) franchise-related revenues, including royalties, national advertising funds contributions, rents and franchise fees received from Wendy’s franchised restaurants. Company-operated restaurants comprised approximately 5% of the total Wendy’s system as of December 30, 2018.
Wendy’s Restaurants
Wendy’s opened its first restaurant in Columbus, Ohio in 1969. During 2018, Wendy’s opened seven new Company-operated restaurants and closed five generally underperforming Company-operated restaurants. During 2018, Wendy’s franchisees opened 152 new restaurants and closed 77 generally underperforming restaurants.
The following table sets forth the number of Wendy’s restaurants in operation at the beginning and end of each fiscal year from 2016 to 2018:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Restaurants open at beginning of period | 6,634 | | | 6,537 | | 6,479 | 
Restaurants opened during period | 159 | | | 174 | | 149 | 
Restaurants closed during period | (82 | ) | | (77 | ) | (91 | )
Restaurants open at end of period | 6,711 | | | 6,634 | | 6,537 | 

Operations
Each Wendy’s restaurant offers an extensive menu specializing in hamburger sandwiches and featuring filet of chicken breast sandwiches, which are prepared to order with the customer’s choice of condiments. Wendy’s menu also includes chicken nuggets, chili, french fries, baked potatoes, freshly prepared salads, soft drinks, Frosty® desserts and kids’ meals. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited time basis. Wendy’s also offers breakfast in some restaurants in the United States.
Free-standing Wendy’s restaurants generally include a pick-up window in addition to a dining room. Approximately two-thirds of sales at Company-operated Wendy’s restaurants occur through the pick-up window.
Wendy’s strives to maintain quality and uniformity throughout all restaurants by publishing detailed specifications for food products, preparation and service, continual in-service training of employees, restaurant operational audits and field visits from Wendy’s supervisors. In the case of franchisees, field visits are made by Wendy’s personnel who review operations, including quality, service and cleanliness and make recommendations to assist in compliance with Wendy’s specifications.
Wendy’s does not sell food or restaurant supplies to its franchisees.

Raw Materials and Purchasing
As of December 30, 2018, four independent processors (five total production facilities) supplied all of Wendy’s beef in the United States. In addition, six independent processors (12 total production facilities) supplied all of Wendy’s chicken in the United States. Wendy’s and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures or other products that are necessary to maintain restaurant operations. Wendy’s anticipates no such shortages of products and believes that alternate suppliers are available. Suppliers to the Wendy’s system must comply with United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulations governing the manufacture, packaging, storage, distribution and sale of all food and packaging products.
Wendy’s has a purchasing co-op relationship agreement with its franchisees which establishes Quality Supply Chain Co-op, Inc. (“QSCC”). QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume. QSCC’s supply chain management facilitates the continuity of supply and provides consolidated purchasing efficiencies while monitoring and seeking to minimize possible obsolete inventory throughout the Wendy’s supply chain in the United States and Canada. Wendy’s and its franchisees pay sourcing fees to third-party vendors on certain products sourced by QSCC. Such sourcing fees are remitted by these vendors to QSCC and are the primary means of funding QSCC’s operations. Should QSCC’s sourcing fees exceed its expected needs, QSCC’s board of directors may return some or all of the excess to its members in the form of a patronage dividend.
Quality Assurance
Wendy’s quality assurance program is designed to verify that the food products supplied to our restaurants are processed in a safe, sanitary environment and in compliance with our food safety and quality standards. Wendy’s quality assurance personnel conduct multiple on-site sanitation and production audits throughout the year at all of our core menu product processing facilities, which include beef, chicken, pork, buns, french fries, Frosty® dessert ingredients and produce. Animal welfare audits are also conducted every year at all beef, chicken and pork facilities to confirm compliance with our required animal welfare and handling policies and procedures. In addition to our facility audit program, weekly samples of beef, chicken and other core menu products from our distribution centers are randomly sampled and analyzed by a third-party laboratory to test conformance to our quality specifications. Each year, Wendy’s representatives conduct unannounced inspections of all Company-operated and franchise restaurants to test conformance to our sanitation, food safety and operational requirements. Wendy’s has the right to terminate franchise agreements if franchisees fail to comply with quality standards.
Trademarks and Service Marks
Wendy’s or its subsidiaries have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, some of which include Wendy’s®, Old Fashioned Hamburgers® and Quality Is Our Recipe®. Wendy’s believes that these and other related marks are of material importance to its business. Domestic trademarks and service marks expire at various times from 2019 to 2028, while international trademarks and service marks have various durations of ten to 15 years. Wendy’s generally intends to renew trademarks and service marks that are scheduled to expire.
Wendy’s entered into an Assignment of Rights Agreement with the Company’s founder, R. David Thomas, and his wife dated as of November 5, 2000 (the “Assignment”). Wendy’s had used Mr. Thomas, who was Senior Chairman of the Board until his death on January 8, 2002, as a spokesperson and focal point for its products and services for many years. With the efforts and attributes of Mr. Thomas, Wendy’s has, through its extensive investment in the advertising and promotional use of Mr. Thomas’ name, likeness, image, voice, caricature, endorsement rights and photographs (the “Thomas Persona”), made the Thomas Persona well known in the United States and throughout North America and a valuable asset for both Wendy’s and Mr. Thomas’ estate. Under the terms of the Assignment, Wendy’s acquired the entire right, title, interest and ownership in and to the Thomas Persona, including the sole and exclusive right to commercially use the Thomas Persona.
Seasonality
Wendy’s restaurant operations are moderately seasonal. Wendy’s average restaurant sales are normally higher during the summer months than during the winter months. Because our business is moderately seasonal, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.

Competition
Each Wendy’s restaurant is in competition with other food service operations within the same geographical area. The quick-service restaurant segment is highly competitive and includes well-established competitors. Wendy’s competes with other restaurant companies and food outlets, primarily through the quality, variety, convenience, price and value perception of food products offered. The number and location of units, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of marketing and new product development by Wendy’s and its competitors are also important factors. The price charged for each menu item may vary from market to market (and within markets) depending on competitive pricing and the local cost structure. Wendy’s also competes within the food service industry and the quick-service restaurant sector not only for customers, but also for personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.
Wendy’s competitive position is differentiated by a focus on quality, its use of fresh, never frozen ground beef* and fresh-cut vegetables in the United States and Canada and certain other countries, its unique and diverse menu, its promotional products, its choice of condiments and the atmosphere and decor of its restaurants. (*Fresh beef available in the contiguous U.S., Alaska and Canada.) Wendy’s continues to implement its Image Activation program, which includes innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs, with plans for a significant number of new and reimaged Company-operated and franchised restaurants in 2019 and beyond. The Image Activation program also differentiates the Company from its competitors by its emphasis on selection and performance of restaurant employees that provide friendly and engaged customer service in Wendy’s restaurants.
Many of the leading restaurant chains continue to focus on new unit development as one strategy to increase market share through increased consumer awareness and convenience. This results in increased competition for available development sites and higher development costs for those sites. Competitors also employ marketing strategies such as frequent use of price discounting, frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Continued price discounting, including the use of coupons and offers, in the quick-service restaurant industry and the emphasis on value menus has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on Wendy’s business. 
Other restaurant chains have also competed by offering high quality sandwiches made with fresh ingredients and artisan breads, and there are several emerging restaurant chains featuring high quality food served at in-line locations. Several chains have also sought to compete by targeting certain consumer groups, such as capitalizing on trends toward certain types of diets or diet preferences (e.g., low carbohydrate, low trans fat, gluten free or antibiotic free) by offering menu items that are promoted as being consistent with such diets.
Additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases come from operators outside the restaurant industry. A number of major grocery chains offer fresh deli sandwiches and fully prepared food and meals to go as part of their deli sections. Some of these chains also have in-store cafes with service counters and tables where consumers can order and consume a full menu of items prepared especially for that portion of the operation. Additionally, convenience stores and retail outlets at gas stations frequently offer sandwiches and other foods.
Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets which sell food that will be prepared at home. Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased as the gap between the price of food at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants has widened.
Technology and delivery are becoming increasingly critical parts of the restaurant consumer experience. Restaurant technology includes mobile interactive technology for brand menu search information, mobile ordering, mobile payment, mobile offers and rewards programs and other self-service technologies. Wendy’s has established a delivery arrangement using a third-party vendor in several United States markets, and certain of our franchisees have established delivery arrangements using a third-party vendor in several Canadian markets. As of December 30, 2018, delivery was available at more than 60% of Wendy’s North America system restaurants. Other restaurant chains have also introduced or expanded their restaurant technology initiatives and delivery arrangements as another strategy to increase market share.
Acquisitions and Dispositions of Wendy’s Restaurants
During 2016, the Company completed the sale of 310 Company-operated restaurants to franchisees, which resulted in the completion of the Company’s plan to reduce its Company-operated restaurant ownership percentage to approximately 5% of the total system. During 2017, the Company acquired 140 Wendy’s restaurants from DavCo Restaurants, LLC (“DavCo”), which were immediately sold to NPC International, Inc. (“NPC”), an existing franchisee of the Company. During 2018, the Company sold three Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and acquired 16 Wendy’s restaurants from franchisees. In addition, during 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company facilitated franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of 96, 400 and 144 restaurants, respectively.

Wendy’s expects to continue to optimize its system by facilitating franchisee-to-franchisee transfers of restaurants, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate Image Activation adoption. Wendy’s generally retains a right of first refusal in connection with any proposed sale of a franchisee’s interest.
North America Franchised Restaurants
As of December 30, 2018, Wendy’s franchisees operated 5,825 Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada.
The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in the United States are set forth in the Wendy’s Unit Franchise Agreement (non-traditional locations may operate under an amended agreement). This document provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy’s restaurant upon a site accepted by Wendy’s and to use the Wendy’s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Unit Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a 10-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The initial term may be extended up to 25 years and the renewal extended up to 20 years for qualifying restaurants under the new restaurant development incentive and remodel programs described below. Wendy’s has in the past franchised under different agreements on a multi-unit basis; however, Wendy’s now grants new Wendy’s franchises on a unit-by-unit basis.
The Wendy’s Unit Franchise Agreement requires that the franchisee pay a monthly royalty of 4% of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay Wendy’s an initial technical assistance fee. In the United States, the standard technical assistance fee required under a newly executed Unit Franchise Agreement is $50,000 for each new restaurant opened.
The technical assistance fee is used to defray some of the costs to Wendy’s for training, start-up and transitional services related to new and existing franchisees acquiring Company-operated restaurants and in the development and opening of new restaurants. In certain limited instances (such as the re-granting of franchise rights for a previously closed restaurant, a reduced franchise agreement term or other unique circumstances), Wendy’s may charge a reduced technical assistance fee or may waive the technical assistance fee. Wendy’s does not select or employ personnel on behalf of franchisees.
Wendy’s also enters into development and/or relationship agreements with certain franchisees. The development agreement provides the franchisee with the right to develop a specified number of new Wendy’s restaurants using the Image Activation design within a stated, non-exclusive territory for a specified period, subject to the franchisee meeting interim new restaurant development requirements. The relationship agreement addresses other aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, such as restrictions on operating competing restaurants, participation in brand initiatives such as the Image Activation program, employment of approved operators, confidentiality and restrictions on engaging in sale/leaseback or debt refinancing transactions without Wendy’s prior consent.
Wendy’s Restaurants of Canada Inc. (“WROC”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s, holds master franchise rights for Canada. The rights and obligations governing the majority of franchised restaurants operating in Canada are set forth in a Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement. This document provides the franchisee the right to construct, own and operate a Wendy’s restaurant upon a site accepted by WROC and to use the Wendy’s system in connection with the operation of the restaurant at that site. The Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement provides for a 20-year term and a 10-year renewal subject to certain conditions. The sub-franchisee pays to WROC a monthly royalty of 4% of sales, as defined in the agreement, from the operation of the restaurant. The agreement also typically requires that the franchisee pay WROC an initial technical assistance fee. The standard technical assistance fee is C$50,000 for each new restaurant opened.
In order to promote new restaurant development, Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program. In August 2018, Wendy’s announced a new restaurant development incentive program that provides for incremental reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants for existing franchisees that sign up for the program and commit to incremental development of new Wendy’s restaurants under a new development agreement by July 1, 2019. Wendy’s also provides franchisees with the option of an early 20-year renewal of their franchise agreement upon completion of reimaging utilizing certain approved Image Activation remodel designs.

Franchised restaurants are required to be operated under uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, quality and preparation of menu items, signage, decor, equipment, uniforms, suppliers, maintenance and cleanliness of premises and customer service. Wendy’s monitors franchisee operations and inspects restaurants periodically to ensure that required practices and procedures are being followed.
See Note 7 and Note 21 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein, and the information under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” herein, for further information regarding guarantee obligations, reserves, commitments and contingencies involving franchisees.
Advertising and Marketing
In the United States and Canada, Wendy’s advertises nationally through national advertising funds on network and cable television programs, including nationally televised events. Locally in the United States and Canada, Wendy’s primarily advertises through regional network and cable television, radio and social media. Wendy’s maintains two national advertising funds established to collect and administer funds contributed for use in advertising through television, radio, the Internet and a variety of promotional campaigns, including the increasing use of social media. Separate national advertising funds are administered for Wendy’s United States and Canadian restaurant locations. Contributions to the national advertising funds are required to be made by both Company-operated and franchised restaurants and are based on a percentage of restaurant retail sales. In addition to the contributions to the national advertising funds, Wendy’s requires additional contributions to be made for both Company-operated and franchised restaurants based on a percentage of restaurant retail sales for the purpose of local and regional advertising programs. Required franchisee contributions to the national advertising funds and for local and regional advertising programs are governed by the Wendy’s Unit Franchise Agreement in the United States and by the Single Unit Sub-Franchise Agreement in Canada. Required contributions by Company-operated restaurants for advertising and promotional programs are at the same percent of retail sales as franchised restaurants within the Wendy’s system. As of December 30, 2018, the contribution rate for United States restaurants was generally 3.5% of retail sales for national advertising and 0.5% of retail sales for local and regional advertising. The contribution rate for Canadian restaurants is generally 3% of retail sales for national advertising and 1% of retail sales for local and regional advertising, with the exception of Quebec, for which there is no national advertising contribution rate and the local and regional advertising contribution rate is 4% of retail sales. See Note 24 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information regarding advertising.
International Operations and Franchising
As of December 30, 2018, Wendy’s had 533 franchised restaurants in 30 countries and territories other than the United States and Canada. Wendy’s intends to grow its international business aggressively, yet responsibly. In addition to new market expansion, further development within existing markets will continue to be an important component of Wendy’s international strategy. In 2018, Wendy’s grew its international business by 29 net new restaurants. Wendy’s has granted development rights in certain countries and territories listed under “Item 2. Properties” herein.
Franchisees who wish to operate Wendy’s restaurants outside of the United States and Canada enter into agreements with Wendy’s that generally provide franchise rights for each restaurant for an initial term of 10 years or 20 years, depending on the country, and typically include a 10-year renewal provision, subject to certain conditions. The agreements grant a license to the franchisee to use the Wendy’s trademarks and know-how in the operation of a Wendy’s restaurant at a specified location. Generally, the franchisee pays Wendy’s an initial technical assistance fee or other per restaurant fee and monthly fees based on a percentage of gross monthly sales of each restaurant. In certain foreign markets, Wendy’s may grant the franchisee exclusivity to develop a territory in exchange for the franchisee undertaking to develop a specified number of new Wendy’s restaurants in the territory based on a negotiated schedule. In these instances, the franchisee generally pays Wendy’s an upfront development fee, annual development fees or a per restaurant development fee. In certain circumstances, Wendy’s may grant a franchisee the right to sub-franchise in a stated territory, subject to certain conditions.
Wendy’s also continually evaluates non-franchise opportunities for development of Wendy’s restaurants in other international markets, including through joint ventures with third parties and opening Company-operated restaurants.

General
Governmental Regulations
Various state laws and the Federal Trade Commission regulate Wendy’s franchising activities. The Federal Trade Commission requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Several states require registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales and have “franchise relationship laws” that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. In addition, Wendy’s and its franchisees must comply with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and similar state and local laws, the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), which requires that all public accommodations and commercial facilities meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, and various state and local laws governing matters that include, for example, the handling, preparation and sale of food and beverages, the provision of nutritional information on menu boards, minimum wages, overtime and other working and safety conditions. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the United States government or an award of damages to private litigants. We do not believe that costs relating to compliance with the ADA will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. We cannot predict the effect on our operations, particularly on our relationship with franchisees, of any pending or future legislation or regulations.
Legal and Environmental Matters
The Company’s past and present operations are governed by federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. We similarly cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any claims relating to environmental laws or regulations. We believe that our operations comply substantially with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Accordingly, the environmental matters in which we are involved generally relate either to properties that our subsidiaries own, but on which they no longer have any operations, or properties that we or our subsidiaries have sold to third parties, but for which we or our subsidiaries remain liable or contingently liable for any related environmental costs. Our Company-operated restaurants have not been the subject of any material environmental matters. Based on currently available information, including defenses available to us and/or our subsidiaries, and our current reserve levels, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of the environmental matters in which we are involved will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Company is involved in litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses. We provide accruals for such litigation and claims when payment is probable and reasonably estimable. We believe we have adequate accruals for continuing operations for all of our legal and environmental matters, including the accrual that we recorded for the legal proceedings related to a cybersecurity incident as described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein. See Note 11 of the Financial Statements and supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information on the accrual. We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur and/or significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions is thus inherently difficult and future developments could cause these actions or claims, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period. 
Employees
As of December 30, 2018, the Company had approximately 12,500 employees, including approximately 1,150 salaried employees and approximately 11,350 hourly employees. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
