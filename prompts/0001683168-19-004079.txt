ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
General
 
Forward Industries, Inc. (“Forward” or the “Company”), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Intelligent Product Solutions (“IPS”), Forward US, Forward Switzerland and Forward UK, is a single source solution provider for the full spectrum of hardware and software product design and engineering services as well as a designer and distributer of carry and protective solutions. The Company offers a full suite of product development services required to conceptualize, create, and maintain products throughout the entire product life-cycle, from product concept and design to production support and field support. Forward provides clients, both large and small, a “one-stop-shop” for product design, development, manufacturing, and distribution.
 
Historically, our principal customer market has been original equipment manufacturers, or “OEMs” (or the contract manufacturing firms of these OEM customers), that either package their products as accessories “in box” together with their branded product offerings, or sell them through their retail distribution channels.
 
On January 29, 2019, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Mooni AB International. By virtue of our strategic collaboration and distribution agreement with Mooni AB International, we have secured a portfolio of smart enabled products which we anticipate will be distributed through retail outlets in the United States. As a result of this collaboration and other product initiatives, the Company began is investing in and building out a distribution network for retail. The distribution network will be responsible for placing products into big box retailers for retail consumption. This build out is a continuation of our strategy to be a one-stop shop for product development, manufacture and distribution and represents a significant achievement in completing our strategy of taking a product from concept to the consumer. We anticipate having product in retail outlets by the second fiscal quarter of 2020. We have developed a sales team that covers North America by leveraging the manufacturer's representative model. We have identified and signed agreements with long-established firms that have years of experience and relationships with big box retailers that we are targeting in both the United States and Canada.
 
Through the manufacture representative agreements we currently have in place, we hope to gain sales coverage to retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Walmart, Costco, CVS, Walgreens, Staples, Office Depot and many others. The manufacture representative model allows us to engage and support a large sales team and cover a lot of territory with a variable cost model as these representatives work on commission only.
 
Corporate History
 
Forward was incorporated in 1961 as a manufacturer and distributer of advertising specialty and promotional products. In 1989, we acquired Forward US, a manufacturer of soft-sided carrying cases. The carrying case business became our predominant business, and in September 1997, we sold the assets relating to the production of advertising specialty and promotional products, ceasing to operate in that segment.
 
In May 2001, we formed Forward Switzerland to facilitate distribution of aftermarket products under our licenses for cell phone cases with a major North American multinational and to further develop our OEM European business presence. After the expiration of the last of these licenses in March 2009, staff at Forward Switzerland was significantly reduced and in recent years has primarily served our OEM customers in Europe.

In January 2018, Forward acquired IPS which resulted in IPS being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forward. The Company believes that the design and engineering service capabilities of IPS will augment the Company’s core sourcing business.
 
In this report, the Company uses the term “distribution” to refer to what has historically been described as the “OEM” business. However, we may refer to our customers as “OEM” customers, using a standard industry term. In addition, we use the term “design” or “design and development” to describe the acquired IPS business, to be consistent with the operating segment definitions (see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements herein).
 
Customers
 
The Company’s distribution customers are located in (i) the Asia-Pacific Region, which we refer to as the “APAC Region”; (ii) Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, which we refer to as the “EMEA Region”; and (iii) the Americas.
 
IPS is currently actively providing product development services for Fortune 500 companies, established mid-level companies, and start-ups. The wide range of industries served includes industrial electronics, medical and dental equipment, food/beverage, U.S. Department of Defense, certain luxury brands, and oil/gas.
 
Products
 
The Company’s distribution products include carrying cases and other accessories for medical monitoring and diagnostic kits and a variety of other portable electronic and non-electronic products (such as sporting and recreational products, bar code scanners, smartphones, GPS location devices, tablets, and firearms).
 
The Company does not manufacture any of its distribution products and sources substantially all of its distribution products from independent suppliers in China, through Forward China, a related party (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).
 
Diabetic Products
 
We sell carrying cases for blood glucose diagnostic kits (“Diabetic Products”) directly to OEM customers, or their contract manufacturers. These electronic monitoring kits are made for use by diabetics. We typically sell these cases at prices ranging from approximately $0.60 to $7.00 per unit. Unit volumes are sold predominantly at the lower end of this price range. We also sell higher end units ranging from approximately $18.50 to $39.00 per unit, but this represents less than 1% of net revenues. The distribution customer (or its contract manufacturer) packages our carry cases “in box” as a custom accessory for the customer’s blood glucose testing and monitoring kits, or to a much lesser extent, sells them through their retail distribution channels. These kits typically include a small, electronic blood glucose monitor, testing strips, lancets for drawing a drop of blood and our carrying case, customized with the manufacturer’s logo and designed to fit and secure the glucose monitor, testing strips, and lancets in separate straps, pouches, and holders. As the kits and technology change, our carrying case designs change to accommodate the changes in size, shape and layout of the electronic monitoring device, strips and lancet. For Fiscal 2019, our Diabetic Products customers accounted for approximately 89% of our total net revenues in the distribution business, compared to 89% in Fiscal 2018.
Other Products
 
We also sell carrying and protective solutions to distribution customers for a diverse array of other portable electronic and other products (“Other Products”), including sporting and recreational products, bar code scanners, smartphones, GPS and location devices, tablets, and firearms, on a made-to-order basis that are customized to fit the products sold by our distribution customers. Our selling prices for these products also vary across a broad range, depending on the size and nature of the product for which we design and sell the carry solution. For Fiscal 2019, our Other Products accounted for approximately 11% of our total net revenues in the distribution business, compared to 11% in Fiscal 2018.

The acquisition of IPS has enabled us to provide a complete range of design, engineering and development services with respect to a diverse array of consumer and industrial electronics products. These include but are not limited to medical products, smart displays, beverage vending, enterprise and mobile software applications, lighting, security and detections systems, cameras, wearables and vehicle controls. Solutions in these and other areas are designed and developed in-house, beginning at product concept, extending through design, engineering and prototype, and final design for manufacturing and Computer-Aided Design (“CAD”) files. As a combined company, we are able to provide manufacturing sourcing and final product support and delivery services for initial short-run, low volume products.
 
Product Development
 
In our distribution business, the product life cycle in distributing and selling our technology solutions to our customers is as described below. We typically receive requests to submit product designs in connection with a customer’s introduction and rollout to market of a new product. IPS collaborates with clients to determine functionality, size and other basic specifications and requirements for products. Our design and production resources develop more detailed product specifications and design options for our customer’s evaluation. We provide documentation of each phase to the client and gain approval of a working prototype. Working with our suppliers and the customer, samples are modified and refined. Once approved for commercial introduction and order by our customer, we work with our suppliers to ensure conformity of commercial production to the definitive product samples and specifications. Manufacture and delivery of products in production quantities are coordinated with the customer’s manufacturing and shipment schedules so that our products are available to be packaged with the customer’s additional product components prior to shipment and sale, or to make the product available to the customer for direct sale through its retail distribution channels. 
Services
 
Services offered for each engagement vary from full development utilizing a wide range of in-house design and engineering functions, to targeted design and engineering support for clients with in-house development teams. In-house capabilities (over 100 designers and engineers including contractors) include the following:

Distribution
 
Channels of Distribution
 
We primarily ship our products directly to our distribution customers (or their contract manufacturers), who package our accessory products “in box” with their branded products. Some of our customers also purchase certain of our products and offer them for sale as stand-alone accessories to complement their product offerings.

Distribution Hubs for Customers
 
During Fiscal 2017, we had distribution hub arrangements with four distribution customers. Effective May 1, 2017, one of the hub arrangements was changed from consignment to FOB shipping point. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2019, we had distribution hub arrangements with three distribution customers. These arrangements obligate us to supply our products to our customer’s distribution hubs (may be multiple locations) where their products are manufactured, kitted, and/or warehoused pending sale, and where our products are packaged “in box” with the distribution customer’s products or, to a much lesser extent, distributed for retail sale. The product quantities we are required to supply to each distribution hub are based on the distribution customer’s purchase orders and forecasts. We do not recognize revenue for product shipped to a hub until we have been notified by our customer that our product has been withdrawn or used by the distribution hub. Hub arrangements have had the general effect of providing financing for our customers’ inventory purchases by extending the time between our placement of orders to our suppliers in order to ship and supply the hubs and the time that we are able to recognize revenue. The corollary effect is an increase in our inventory levels.
Product Supply
 
Manufacturing
 
The manufacture of custom carrying cases and other carry and protective solutions generally consists of die cutting fabrics and heat sealing, gluing, sewing, and decorating (affixing logos to) the cut-outs by means of silk screening, hot-stamping, embroidering or embossing. The principal materials used in the manufacture of our products are vinyl, nylon, leather, metal and plastic parts (for clips, buckles, loops, hinges and other hardware), foam padding and cardboard, all of which are obtained from suppliers based on our specifications. We do not believe that any of the component materials or parts used in the manufacture of our products are supply constrained. We believe that there are adequate available alternative sources of supply for all of the materials used to manufacture, package, and ship our products.
Dependence on Sourcing Agent
 
On September 9, 2015, the Company renewed a Buying Agency and Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Forward China (the “Agent”) on substantially the same terms as its previous buying agency and supply agreement with the Agent, which was due to expire on September 11, 2015. The Supply Agreement provides that the Agent acts as the Company’s exclusive buying agent of carry and protective solutions. The Agent also arranges for sourcing, manufacture and exportation of such products. The Company purchases products at the Agent’s cost and pays a service fee to the Agent. The service fee is calculated at $100,000 monthly plus 4% of “Adjusted Gross Profit”, which is defined as the selling price less the cost from the Agent. The Supply Agreement has been extended to October 22, 2020. Mr. Terence Wise, the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder, is a principal of the Agent. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” regarding our dependence on the Agent.
Suppliers
 
We procure substantially all of our carrying solutions products for our distribution business from independent suppliers in China through the Agent. Depending on the product, we may require several different suppliers to furnish component parts or pieces.
 
We place orders with the Agent at the time we receive firm purchase orders and/or forecasts from our distribution customers for a particular product. Accordingly, we do not have minimum supply requirement agreements with our suppliers to guarantee a supply of finished product, nor have we made purchase commitments to purchase minimum amounts from any of our suppliers. However, from time to time, we may order products from our suppliers in advance of receiving a customer purchase order, or in quantities in excess of those forecasted to us by our customer, for which they are contractually obligated to us, in order to meet our customer’s anticipated delivery demands. Beginning September 1, 2013 we began making purchases directly from Forward China. During the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, all of our purchases for our distribution business were made directly through Forward China.

There are very few suppliers for the design and development part of the business as it is a services based business. We do, however, purchase supplies and equipment to develop prototypes or “mock-ups” for design and development projects. Design business suppliers are predominantly based in the United States.
 
Quality Assurance
 
Forward’s quality assurance manager oversees the process to ensure that our distribution products manufactured by our Chinese suppliers meet our quality assurance standards. He independently verifies and supervises the inspection of products provided by independent contractors in China that may be affiliated with one or more of our suppliers. In July 2015, Forward China received its ISO 9001:2008 quality certification, which was renewed in July 2018 and is valid until July 2021.
 
IPS follows general industry standard practices for review and corrective actions related to its design services. There are no independent quality assurance standards in place for its design and engineering work. Customer specifications and scope of services are laid out in the project contracts and IPS works closely with the customer to identify and correct any quality issues that arise.
 
Competition
 
Distribution Business
 
The distribution business, or OEM business, is highly competitive in terms of product pricing, design, delivery terms, and customer service. In the production of our distribution products, we compete with numerous United States and foreign producers and distributors. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources. We believe that we sustain our competitive position through maintenance of an effective product design capability, rapid response time to customer requests for proposals and product shipment, reliable product delivery and product quality, and competitive pricing. We believe that our ability to compete based on product quality assurance considerations is enhanced by Forward China’s local presence, quality control, shipment capabilities and expertise in sourcing.
Design and Engineering Business
 
The depth and breadth of the services offered, and industries served by IPS are unique. The IPS management team is aware that there are very few competitive firms that have the full set of capabilities that IPS has under one roof. There are however, numerous design and engineering companies that compete with IPS in specific industries and/or with specific targeted skills or competitive advantages.
Employees
 
As of December 12 2019, we had 73 full-time employees. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Regulation and Environmental Protection
 
Our sourcing business is subject to various regulations in various jurisdictions, including the United States and member states of the European Community, that restrict the use or importation of products manufactured with compounds deemed to be hazardous. We work with our suppliers to ensure compliance with such regulations. In addition, from time to time one or more customers may require testing of our products to ensure compliance with applicable consumer safety rules and regulations or the customer’s safety or packaging protocols. Because we do not manufacture the products that we sell and distribute, compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had, and is not anticipated to have, any direct material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. However, compliance with such laws and regulations on the part of our suppliers may result in increased costs of supply to us, particularly if domestic environmental regulation in China becomes more prevalent.

We have not been engaged in any environmental litigation or incurred any material costs related to compliance with environmental or other regulations. From time to time, we incur chemical and/or safety laboratory testing expenses in order to address customer requests regarding our product materials or method of manufacture or regarding their packaging methods and standards.
 
There are no specific regulatory or environmental requirements imposed upon the IPS business. As a paid service provider, end customers are assisted in securing regulatory certifications including UL (Underwriters Laboratories – a U.S. based safety certification organization), FCC (Federal Communications Commission – U.S. governmental certification department for electronic goods), CE (Conformité Européenne – a European certification for health, safety and environmental protection standards) and others depending on needs, product types and locations of end customers’ product markets.
