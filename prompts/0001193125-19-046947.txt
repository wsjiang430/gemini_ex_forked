 Efficient and Low-Cost Manufacturing Operations.    Through its Operational Excellence initiatives, AMETEK has established a lean manufacturing platform for its businesses. In its effort to achieve best-cost manufacturing, AMETEK had plants, as of December 31, 2018, in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, and Serbia. These plants offer proximity to customers and provide opportunities for increasing international sales. Acquisitions also have allowed AMETEK to reduce costs and achieve operating synergies by consolidating operations, product lines and distribution channels, benefitting both of AMETEKs operating groups. 
 Experienced Management Team.    Another component of AMETEKs success is the strength of its management team and that teams commitment to improving Company performance. AMETEK senior management has extensive industry experience and an average of approximately 26 years of AMETEK service. The management team is focused on achieving results, building stockholder value and continually growing AMETEK. Individual performance is tied to financial results through Company-established stock ownership guidelines and equity incentive programs. 
Business Strategy 
 AMETEK is committed to achieving earnings growth through the successful implementation of a Corporate Growth Plan. The goal of that plan is double-digit annual percentage growth in sales and earnings per share over the business cycle and a superior return on total capital. In addition, other financial initiatives have been or may be undertaken, including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain foreign countries and share repurchases. 
 AMETEKs Corporate Growth Plan consists of four key strategies: 
 Operational Excellence.    Operational Excellence is AMETEKs cornerstone strategy for accelerating growth, improving profit margins and strengthening its competitive position across its businesses. Operational Excellence focuses on initiatives to drive increased organic sales growth, improvements in operating efficiencies and sustainable practices. It emphasizes team building and a participative management culture. AMETEKs Operational Excellence strategies include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, Design for Six Sigma, Value Engineering/Value Analysis and growth kaizens. Each plays an important role in improving efficiency, enhancing the pace and quality of innovation and driving profitable sales growth. Operational Excellence initiatives have yielded lower operating and administrative costs, shortened manufacturing cycle times, resulted in higher cash flow from operations and increased customer satisfaction. They also have played a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies. 
 Strategic Acquisitions.    Acquisitions are a key to achieving the goals of AMETEKs Corporate Growth Plan. Since the beginning of 2014 through December 31, 2018, AMETEK has completed 21 acquisitions with annualized sales totaling more than $1.2 billion, including six acquisitions in 2018 (see Recent Acquisitions). AMETEK targets companies that offer the right strategic, technical and cultural fit. It seeks to acquire businesses in adjacent markets with complementary products and technologies. It also looks for businesses that provide attractive growth opportunities, often in new and emerging markets. Through these and prior acquisitions, AMETEKs management team has developed considerable skill in identifying, acquiring and integrating new businesses. As it has executed its acquisition strategy, AMETEKs mix of businesses has shifted toward those that are more highly differentiated and, therefore, offer better opportunities for growth and profitability. 
 Global & Market Expansion.    AMETEK has experienced strong growth outside the United States, reflecting an expanding international customer base, investments in its global infrastructure and the attractive growth potential of its businesses in overseas markets. While Europe remains its largest overseas market, AMETEK has pursued growth opportunities worldwide, especially in key emerging markets. It has grown sales in Latin America and Asia by strategically building, acquiring and expanding manufacturing

  facilities. AMETEK also has expanded its sales and service capabilities in China and enhanced its sales presence and engineering capabilities in India. Elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East, it has expanded sales, service and technical support. Recently acquired businesses have further added to AMETEKs international presence. 
 New Products.    New products are essential to AMETEKs long-term growth. As a result, AMETEK has maintained a consistent investment in new product development and engineering. In 2018, AMETEK added to its highly differentiated product portfolio with a range of new products across many of its businesses. They included:
