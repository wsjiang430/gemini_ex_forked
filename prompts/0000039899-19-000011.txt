ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are an innovative media company serving the greater good of our communities - through empowering stories, impactful investigations and extensive marketing services. With 49 television stations and two radio stations in 41 U.S. markets, we are the largest owner of big four network affiliates in the top 25 markets, reaching approximately one-third of all television households nationwide. Each television station also has a robust digital presence across online, mobile and social platforms, reaching consumers whenever, wherever they are. Each month, we reach 50 million consumers on-air and approximately 35 million across our digital platforms. We have been consistently honored with the industry’s top awards, including Edward R. Murrow, George Polk, Alfred I. DuPont and Emmy Awards. Through TEGNA Marketing Solutions (TMS), our integrated sales and back-end fulfillment operations, we deliver results for advertisers across television, email, social, and Over the Top (OTT) platforms, including Premion, our OTT advertising network.
All of this is now delivered through a company with one singular focus; in 2017, we completed our transformation into a pure-play broadcast company. On May 31, 2017 we successfully completed the spin-off of Cars.com into a separate stand-alone public company and on July 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our controlling ownership interest in CareerBuilder. The completion of these strategic actions has reduced our debt and has further strengthened our balance sheet, providing us the ability to invest in our media businesses, capitalizing on opportunities for organic and acquisition-related growth. Our media operations generate strong and dependable cash flows and we are financially disciplined, which allows us to return additional value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are a leader in embracing change and driving innovation across our businesses, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the evolving regulatory environment.
Operating Structure
We have one operating and reportable segment which generated revenues of $2.2 billion in 2018. The primary sources of our revenues are: 1) advertising & marketing services revenues, which include local and national non-political advertising, digital marketing services (including Premion), and advertising on the stations’ websites and tablet and mobile products; 2) subscription revenues, reflecting fees paid by satellite, cable, OTT (companies that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet) and telecommunications providers to carry our television signals on their systems; 3) political advertising revenues, which are driven by even year election cycles at the local and national level (e.g. 2018, 2016) and particularly in the second half of those years; and 4) other services, such as production of programming from third parties and production of advertising material.
The advertising revenues generated by a station’s local news programs make up a significant part of its total advertising revenues. Advertising pricing is influenced by demand for advertising time. This demand is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and demographics of the local populations, the concentration of businesses, local economic conditions, and the popularity or ratings of the station’s programming. Almost all national advertising is placed through independent advertising representatives, while local advertising time is sold by each station’s own sales force.
Our portfolio of “Big 4” NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX stations operate under long-term network affiliation agreements. Generally, a network provides programs to its affiliated television stations and the network sells commercial advertising for certain of the available advertising spots within the network programs, while our television stations sell the remaining available commercial advertising spots. Our television stations also produce local programming such as news, sports, and entertainment.
Broadcast affiliates and their network partners continue to have the broadest appeal in terms of household viewership, viewing time and audience reach. The overall reach of events such as the Olympics and NFL Football, along with our extensive local news and non-news programming, continues to surpass the reach in viewership of individual cable channels. Our ratings and reach are driven by the quality of programs we and our network partners produce and by the strong local connections we have to our communities, which gives us a unique position among the numerous program choices viewers have, regardless of platform.
Strategy
Our Board of Directors actively and regularly reviews, guides and oversees the development and implementation of our long-term strategic plan to create value for our stakeholders. The key elements of our strategy are as follows: 
Continue to innovate in our content offerings to our consumers. Our trusted, local content is the driver of our success across all distribution channels and is a key ingredient that powers our current and future revenues. Our scale has allowed us to invest in comprehensive content and digital innovation initiatives. Our focus on data-driven editorial processes, new storytelling formats, and unique visual presentations across all our platforms are helping to make our content the consumers’ first choice, no matter the platform.

In 2018, we continued significant efforts to embrace change, transform our content and connect with audiences in unique and powerful ways. Our culture encourages and embraces bold thinking and ideas from across the company. We are creating unique, live and original content in news and non-news time periods to meet changing viewer habits. In an on-demand OTT world, live, locally-relevant content is becoming far more important than it was in the past, and we are acting on that trend. We have continued to make wholesale transformations of our local news operations. We have invested in true digital-first newsrooms, leveraging analytics to better serve audiences and clients on-air and via mobile devices.
We are recognized nationally for our innovation in reinventing local journalism in the digital age. Over the past year, we have conducted digital-first investigations that shined a light on important issues, holding the powerful accountable and helping drive change and results for those without a voice. Projects like “Verify,” which provides unbiased fact-checking on a variety of topics, developed before ‘fake news’ entered the common vernacular, was rolled out across all markets in 2017 and enhanced in 2018. “Verify” segments are platform agnostic and air on broadcast channels, are posted to social media channels and are shared across desktop, digital and mobile apps. Other impactful digital-first investigations such as “Selling Girls,” a six-part series produced by the award-winning investigative news teams from 11Alive in Atlanta and KHOU in Houston, focused on trafficking of American minor children. Initially launched across stations’ digital platforms, the series was localized, highlighting the direct impact of child sex trafficking in specific communities across the U.S. 
We produce new, multi-platform, non-news programs, replacing the syndicated programs in these timeslots. These programs are produced at our local stations, reducing cost while allowing us to quickly respond to local needs and tastes in content. “Daily Blast LIVE,” a groundbreaking 30-minute live news and entertainment show produced out of KUSA in Denver is in its second year. “Daily Blast LIVE” is a first-of-its-kind format that is live in nearly all time zones across 50 markets, something unprecedented in TV syndication, and is also available on Facebook and YouTube. The content on “Daily Blast LIVE” is crowdsourced in real-time from viewers though social media. “Sister Circle,” a live daily talk show that targets African-American women - a large and traditionally underserved audience – is also in its second year. Produced by WATL in Atlanta, “Sister Circle” reaches approximately 60 percent of U.S. television households, distributed across 14 TEGNA markets and on TV One, a cable network offering a broad range of programming for a diverse audience of adult African-American viewers. 
Increase engagement across all platforms. As the consumption of content on digital platforms increases, we have continued to make investments in developing new ways of connecting with local audiences and enhancing our digital capabilities. In 2018, this included initiatives focused on diversifying our web traffic sources, improving our digital workflows and deploying industry-first innovations across our newsrooms. 

• | Diversifying Audience Traffic Sources: Platforms control an increasing amount of consumer attention, and we have placed an emphasis on diversifying our digital traffic sources and building direct relationships with our audience. In 2018, this included an aggressive strategy around improving our traffic via search engines like Google, growing our presence on YouTube, launching new email newsletter products in 18 markets and decreasing our dependency on traffic from social networks like Facebook. As a result of these efforts, our digital properties have seen improvements of +16% in Loyalty (Visits Per Visitor) and +115% in video views on YouTube during 2018. Since launching an initiative focused on search engine optimization in April 2018, referral traffic to our digital properties via search engines increased +60%.


• | Improving Digital Workflows: In 2018, we developed and began deployment of a new content management system across all of our markets. Our new platform integrates data into the story creation process, makes it easier to quickly publish videos and enables us to optimize our content for the wide variety of distribution platforms. Importantly, the new platform will also allow us to continually iterate on our capabilities as the digital ecosystem evolves, while reducing our ongoing operating expenses.


• | Industry-first innovators: Our culture of innovation led to several unique partnerships in 2018. We were the first local broadcaster to integrate Snapchat into our on-air broadcasts, which has provided an exclusive view into various news events, including a sit-in protest at Howard University where the media wasn’t allowed inside. We also partnered with Facebook to launch “An Imperfect Union”, a weekly show that we debuted ahead of the midterm elections to bring two people from opposing sides of an issue together for conversation and service in their communities.

Taking advantage of several hot political races happening in our markets in 2018, we partnered with Twitter to live stream political debates, including the Texas Debate between Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke, which was viewed by more than 500,000 people.
Grow subscription revenue. Subscription revenue has steadily increased in the last several years, better reflecting the value of the content that our business provides. Pursuant to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, every three years a local television station must elect to either (1) require cable and/or direct broadcast satellite operators to carry the station’s signal or (2) require such cable and satellite operators to negotiate retransmission consent agreements to secure carriage. At present, we have retransmission consent agreements with almost all cable operators and satellite providers for carriage of our television stations. We also have retransmission agreements with major telecommunications companies.

Our scale and strength in local content has contributed to our ability to grow our subscription revenue beyond traditional multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) into the growing OTT space as well. Moving our content onto OTT platforms allows us to reach an additional demographic of newer viewers that consume content online rather than through MVPDs, enabling us to expand our subscription revenues and deliver advertising products to a broader viewing audience.
We have several large OTT distribution deals with major network partners and streaming services such as Hulu, YouTube TV and Direct TV Now, permitting them to carry our stations’ content. Because our stations serve large markets that are pivotal to the success of companies offering platforms in the OTT space, we have negotiated favorable agreements with economics with new OTT entrants that are as good or better than with traditional MVPDs, making us economically agnostic to consumer platform choices. 
Improve the value we bring to advertisers. Through TMS, we continued to expand market share through our sales transformation efforts, including innovations like our centralized 360-degree marketing services agency, our centralized pricing platform, and a well-trained, solutions-oriented salesforce. We provide our clients with data-driven integrated marketing services, a holistic approach to put their advertising dollars to work in the channels that make the most sense for them, regardless of the platform. We serve our clients by providing deep consumer insights, unique creative solutions, and customization. To that end, in 2017 we rolled out a sophisticated pricing platform that marries disparate data sets and other advanced technologies to provide more optimal predictive pricing insights both for our salesforce and, ultimately, for our advertising clients. This software will also allow us to play a pivotal role as the industry shifts to more automated buying platforms. 
Late in 2016, we launched the industry’s first OTT local advertising network, Premion, a one-stop-shop that allows local, regional and national customers to place advertising on long-form programs across a broad array of services such as streaming devices, smart TVs and web browsers. Premion is a highly desirable buy for advertisers trying to reach cord cutters, and is helping us expand our revenue base and giving us access to new markets. Our large, local salesforce is leveraging relationships with local and regional advertisers to sell Premion inventory. Premion’s non-political revenue in 2018 was $64.0 million compared to $30.0 million in 2017. 
Invest in new growth initiatives. We are further diversifying our revenue base by investing in new business models that leverage our strong assets and scale. 

• | Intelligent Ad Automation. Premion has been our first investment in intelligent ad automation. Premion has created a technology platform to aggregate inventory from OTT providers and then resell the inventory to local and regional advertisers leveraging our salesforce.

In addition to Premion, we are working to accelerate the automation of national spot advertising. In 2017, we teamed with several other broadcasters to create a set of Application Programming Interface’s (API’s) to enable software companies to more easily enter the market and work with the broader ecosystem. In 2019, we will continue to seek additional investment opportunities in this space.

• | Performance Marketing. We are a leading provider of digital marketing services for advertisers. We have continued to evolve our product offerings in 2018, improving profitability by focusing our resources on our largest, most important clients. We have expanded our investments in attribution across linear television and OTT, more effectively demonstrating the value all our advertising products bring to our clients.


• | ATSC 3.0. In 2017, the FCC began the process to issue rules that would give permission to broadcast in the new ATSC 3.0 broadcast transmissions standard, which will allow broadcasters to enhance their existing transmission services with a new standardized system that will allow us to compete directly with Internet IP protocols. This new standard will allow us to support higher 4K high dynamic range resolution, higher frame rate, mobile, second screen experiences, 3D audio, virtual reality, advanced advertising and other exciting enhancements to the viewing experience. The service enables encryption and content protection which will allow broadcasters for the first time to protect their signal and employ paywalls. In 2018, we worked with other broadcasters as part of the Pearl consortium’s ongoing pilot testing of the new standard in Phoenix, Arizona. We expect to continue rolling out ATSC 3.0 pending the completion of the new standard in coordination with upgrades related to our spectrum repack transition.

Capitalize on opportunities to grow inorganically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation enables us to opportunistically grow the business through acquisitions. We believe that we are well-positioned to participate in a changing media landscape, as we have ample headroom under the existing ownership cap regulations (as discussed in “Regulation” section of Item 1) to pursue large vertical consolidations and other opportunities as we have done in the past. We also see future accretive in-market consolidation opportunities within our existing footprint, where we have single Big-4 affiliate stations in large markets.

On February 15, 2018, we acquired, for approximately $328.4 million in cash, assets in San Diego consisting of KFMB-TV (CBS affiliate station on its primary channel and a CW affiliate on multicast channel KFMB-D2) and radio broadcast stations KFMB-AM and KFMB-FM. Through this transaction, we added a strong market to our portfolio. San Diego is the 29th largest U.S. TV market with approximately 1 million households and the 17th largest radio market. KFMB-TV is the long-standing market leader in San Diego. 
On January 2, 2019, we acquired, for approximately $108.9 million in cash, stations in Toledo, OH and Midland-Odessa, TX. WTOL, the CBS affiliate in Toledo and KWES, the NBC affiliate in Midland-Odessa are recognized as strong local media brands well-positioned in key markets that further enhance our portfolio of Big 4 affiliates. KWES further deepens our presence in the high-growth state of Texas where we now own 11 stations, covering 87 percent of television households in the state.
As a result of these transactions, we own or operate 49 television stations in 41 markets, covering approximately one-third of U.S. television households. We remain the largest NBC affiliate group, the second largest CBS affiliate group and the largest owner of Big 4 affiliates in the top 25 markets. 
Competition 
Our company strives to capture as large a viewing audience as possible for each of our broadcast stations, as the number of viewers who watch our stations in each Designated Market Area (DMA) has a direct impact on our ability to maximize both of our major revenue streams: advertising revenue and retransmission consent fees.  We compete for audience share as part of an increasingly varied media landscape.  Our competitors in this space include other local television broadcasters (both network-affiliated and independent), cable networks, video-on-demand programming offered by MVPDs, and online video streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.  
The audience share captured by our broadcast stations positions us to compete against other advertising media for advertising revenues.  We compete for this revenue with other platforms for television advertising media, including other broadcast stations and cable providers.  We also compete against both traditional and new forms of media that offer paid advertising, including radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, online video, and social media.  Major competitors in this space include cable providers Comcast and Charter, as well as internet platforms Google, Facebook, and YouTube.  
With respect to retransmission consent fees, we compete to capture a share of the total amount MVPDs are willing to pay for the rights to distribute linear TV content to their subscribers.  The larger our audience share, the more appealing our programming is to the MVPDs and the more they will be willing to pay for the right to distribute it.  We compete for this revenue against other broadcast stations and cable networks.
The advertising industry is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Through their websites, our stations compete in the local electronic media space, which includes the Internet or Internet-enabled devices, handheld wireless devices such as mobile phones and tablets, social media platforms, digital spectrum opportunities and OTT video services. In this space, we compete for audience and advertising revenue against other local media companies, Internet advertising giants such as Google and Facebook, as well as the fragmented landscape of digital ad agencies. The technology that enables consumers to receive news and information continues to evolve as does our digital strategy.
Regulation
Our television stations are operated under the authority of the FCC, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), and the rules and policies of the FCC (FCC regulations). As a result, our television stations are subject to a variety of obligations, such as restrictions on the broadcast of material deemed “indecent” or “profane,” requirements to provide or pass through closed captioning for most programming, rules requiring the public disclosure of certain information about our stations’ operations, and the obligation to offer programming responsive to the needs and interests of our stations’ communities. The FCC may alter or add to these requirements, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business. Certain significant elements of the FCC’s current regulatory framework for broadcast television are described in further detail below.
Television broadcast licenses generally are granted for eight year periods. They are renewable upon application to the FCC and usually are renewed except in rare cases in which a petition to deny, a complaint or an adverse finding as to the licensee’s qualifications results in loss of the license. We believe that our stations operate in substantial compliance with the Communications Act and FCC regulations.
FCC regulations limit the concentration of broadcasting control and regulate network and local programming practices. In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order altering its regulations governing media ownership, generally making these regulations less restrictive. For example, the order eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which generally prohibited an entity from holding an ownership interest in a daily print newspaper and a full-power broadcast station within the same market, and the television/radio cross-ownership rule, which imposed a number of limits on the ability to own television and radio stations in the same market. Under the revised FCC regulations that took effect on February 7, 2018, common ownership of two television stations in the same market is permitted so long as at least one of the commonly owned stations is 
6

not among the top four rated stations in the market at the time of acquisition. Applications seeking FCC consent for a party to acquire control of two top four rated television stations in the same market will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Independent of the FCC’s ownership regulations, broadcast transactions separately are subject to compliance with applicable antitrust laws, with significant transactions typically subject to review by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.
The FCC’s November 2017 ownership order also eliminated a rule making certain joint advertising sales agreements (JSAs) attributable in calculating compliance with the ownership limits. The FCC will continue to require the disclosure of JSAs and shared services agreements (SSAs) in stations’ online public inspection files, though these agreements generally are not deemed to be attributable ownership interests. The FCC defines SSAs broadly to include a wide range of agreements between separately owned stations, including news sharing agreements and other agreements involving “station-related services.” We provide services under a transition services agreement (which is similar to, but more limited than, the typical shared services agreement) and a JSA with a third party that owns a television station in Tucson, where we also own a television station. We also are party to an SSA under which our newly acquired television station in Toledo, WTOL, provides certain services (not including advertising sales) to another Toledo television station owned by a third party. We are not party to any JSAs other than the JSA in Tucson. We are party to several other agreements involving the limited sharing of certain equipment and resources; some of these agreements may qualify as SSAs subject to disclosure. 
Various parties - including cable operators and other advocates for more stringent broadcast ownership restrictions - generally opposed the changes adopted in the FCC’s November 2017 order and have challenged the order in court. Those consolidated challenges are pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
The Communications Act includes a national ownership cap for broadcast television stations that prohibits any one person or entity from having, in the aggregate, market reach of more than 39% of all U.S. television households. FCC regulations permit stations to discount the market reach of stations that broadcast on UHF channels by 50% (the UHF discount). In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comments on whether it can or should modify or eliminate the national ownership cap and/or the UHF discount. Our 48 television stations (excluding the stations we currently service under services arrangements) reach approximately 28.5% of U.S. television households when the UHF discount is applied and approximately 33.5% without the UHF discount. 
As permitted by the Communications Act and FCC rules, we require cable and satellite operators to negotiate retransmission consent agreements to retransmit our stations’ signals. Under the applicable statutory provisions and FCC rules, such negotiations must be conducted in “good faith.” FCC rules also provide stations with certain protections against cable and satellite operators importing duplicating network or syndicated programming broadcast by distant stations. Pay-TV interests and other parties continue to advocate for the FCC to alter or eliminate various aspects of the rules governing retransmission consent negotiations and stations’ exclusivity rights. If such changes were adopted, they could give cable and satellite operators leverage against broadcasters in retransmission consent negotiations and, as a result, adversely impact our revenue from retransmission and advertising.
In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of a voluntary incentive auction to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, along with a related “repacking” of the television spectrum for remaining television stations. None of our stations will relinquish any spectrum rights as a result of the auction, and accordingly we will not receive any incentive auction proceeds. The FCC has, however, notified us that 13 of our stations will be repacked to new channels. In general, television stations moving channels may have smaller service areas and/or experience additional interference; however, based on our transition planning to date, we do not expect the repacking to have any material effect on the geographic areas or populations served by our repacked full-power stations’ over-the-air signals. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction and repacking established a $1.75 billion fund for reimbursement of costs incurred by stations required to change channels in the repacking. Subsequent legislation enacted on March 23, 2018, appropriated an additional $1 billion for the repacking fund, of which up to $750 million may be made available to repacked full power and Class A television stations and multichannel video programming distributors. Other funds are earmarked to assist affected low power television stations, television translator stations, and FM radio stations, as well for consumer education efforts. Some of our television translator stations have been or will be displaced as a result of the repacking, and thus are eligible under the additional repacking funds appropriation to seek reimbursement for costs incurred as a result of such displacement (subject to the translator locating an available alternative channel, which is not guaranteed). 
The repacking process is scheduled to occur over a 39-month period, divided into ten phases. Our full power stations have been assigned to phases two through nine, and we expect to complete the repack project by the middle of 2020. To date, we have incurred approximately $17.6 million in capital expenditures for the spectrum repack project (of which $16.3 million was paid during 2018). We have received FCC reimbursements of approximately $7.4 million through December 31, 2018. The reimbursements were recorded as a contra operating expense within our asset impairment and other (gains) charges line item on our Consolidated Statement of Income and reported as an investing inflow on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In 2019, we expect to incur approximately $17.0 million in capital expenditures for the repack project. Each repacked full power commercial television station, including each of our 13 repacked stations, has been allocated a reimbursement amount equal to approximately 92.5% of the station’s estimated repacking costs, as verified by the FCC’s fund administrator. Although we expect the FCC to make additional allocations from the fund, it is not guaranteed that the FCC will approve all reimbursement requests necessary to completely reimburse each repacked station for all amounts incurred in connection with the repack.

In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard makes possible a variety of benefits for both broadcasters and viewers, including better sound and picture quality, hyper-localized programming including news and weather, enhanced emergency alerts, improved mobile reception, the use of targeted advertising, and more efficient use of spectrum, potentially allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same 6 megahertz channel. However, ATSC 3.0 is not backwards compatible with existing television equipment. To ensure continued service to all viewers, the FCC’s order authorizing ATSC 3.0 operations requires full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. The content of this simulcast signal must be substantially similar to the programming aired on the ATSC 3.0 channel for a period of at least five years. Transitioning a station to ATSC 3.0 is voluntary under current FCC rules and may require significant expenditures. We expect to continue rolling out the new standard pending the standard’s completion and in coordination with upgrades related to our spectrum repack transition. To the extent we roll ATSC 3.0 service out to our stations, there can be no guarantee that such service would earn sufficient additional revenues to offset the related expenditures.
General Company Information
Our company was founded by Frank E. Gannett and associates in 1906 and was incorporated in 1923. We listed shares publicly for the first time in 1967 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1972. In June 2015, we completed the spin-off of our former publishing businesses, and our company was renamed TEGNA. In addition, in May 2017, we completed the spin-off of our digital automotive business, Cars.com, and in July 2017, we completed the sale of our controlling ownership interest in CareerBuilder, completing our transformation into a pure-play broadcast company. Our headquarters is located at 8350 Broad Street, Suite 2000, Tysons, VA, 22102. Our telephone number is (703) 873-6600 and our website home page is www.tegna.com. We make our website content available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, nor is it incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K).
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements for our annual stockholders’ meetings and amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our investor website, under “Investor Relations” at www.tegna.com as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file the material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, copies of our annual reports will be made available, free of charge, upon written request. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding SEC registrants, including TEGNA Inc. 
Employees
At the end of 2018, we employed 5,336 full-time and part-time people, all of whom were located in the U.S. The following table summarizes our employee headcount at the end of 2018 and 2017.

 | 2018 | 2017 
Media | 5,188 | 5,108
Corporate | 148 | 175 
Total | 5,336 | 5,283

Approximately 11% of our employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions. They are represented by 25 local bargaining units, most of which are affiliated with one of four international unions under collective bargaining agreements. These agreements conform generally with the pattern of labor agreements in the broadcasting industry. We do not engage in industry-wide or company-wide bargaining. 
Environmental Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health. U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA and other federal agencies have the authority to write regulations that have an effect on our operations.
In addition to these federal regulations, various states have authority under the federal statutes mentioned above. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. State and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violating these laws and regulations. We believe that we have complied with such proceedings and orders at our stations without any materially adverse effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Environmental and Sustainability Initiatives
We are committed to managing our environmental impact responsibly and protecting the environment through our media programs and our charitable endeavors.
Our television stations regularly cover environmental and sustainability issues that affect their communities. In 2018, WWL in Louisiana produced a three-part series exploring the infamous "Cancer Alley" along the river parishes of southeast Louisiana. In addition to winning an Emmy, the series resulted in the St. Johns Parish Schools superintendent demanding a reduction in emissions at school facilities. The series also led to the Louisiana Department of Health to reconsider its position that the OSHA standard for chloroprene in the workplace was sufficient for area health impacts. KARE in Minneapolis, Minnesota investigated radon testing in local schools and uncovered that only 53 of 331 school districts reported to have tested classrooms for cancer-causing radon since 2012. As a result, Minnesota’s governor called the situation “disgraceful” and promised action. A new law to mandate testing in schools was recently introduced. WCNC in Charlotte, North Carolina reported on the fact that some Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools had lead levels higher than 400 parts per billion, when the EPA requires action to be taken if lead amounts exceed 15 parts per billion. These results were hidden from parents and only shared internally. WCNC's series publicized exactly which drinking fountains and faucets at which schools had these high lead levels and questioned the school district about why it wasn’t sharing these results publicly. As a result, the district changed its policies and practices and began to send home test results and put the reports online. WHAS, in Louisville, Kentucky investigated a children’s soccer field that is on a toxic landfill that had been used for parking for special events, causing a potential risk to the kids. As a result of this reporting, the city of Louisville is reconsidering allowing future concerts and events to use the soccer fields for parking.
TEGNA’s efforts to reduce our carbon footprint continues at its corporate headquarters as paper storage is reduced by converting materials to a digital format. The shredding of these paper files is part of a recycling program through a local business. Smaller efforts like recycling copier waste toner cartridges, repurposing office supplies, and the strategic placement of recycling waste containers throughout office space all contribute to a conscientious effort toward responsibly managing our environmental impact. We continue to implement thoughtful strategies like LED studio lighting at WXIA Atlanta, KVUE Austin, “Daily Blast LIVE” in Denver, WFAA Dallas, KTHV Little Rock, KHOU Houston, WHAS Louisville, WMAZ Macon, KARE Minneapolis, KPNX Phoenix, and WUSA Washington, in addition to completions of HVAC upgrades in KVUE Austin, KTVB Boise, WZZM Grand Rapids, WVEC Norfolk, WCSH Portland, KXTV Sacramento, KFMB San Diego, and WTSP Tampa. 
The TEGNA Foundation supports nonprofit activities in communities where we do business and contributes to a variety of charitable causes through its Community Grant Program. Community Grants are identified locally by TEGNA stations and include support for community sustainability efforts. In 2018, KFMB supported Kids’ Ocean Day, an environmental education program serving students from Title 1 schools by providing a series of classroom presentations on ocean conservation, culminating in a local beach cleanup. KXTV in Sacramento supported the Soil Born Farm Urban Agriculture Project, providing hands-on education in farming, nutrition and the environment. 
Several initiatives have been undertaken this year to enhance the physical security at local TEGNA stations. This includes fence and building access improvements at WXIA Atlanta, improved access control and fencing at WTLV Jacksonville, and general building and safety and security updates at WTSP Tampa, KSDK St. Louis, WHAS Louisville, WBIR Knoxville, WFAA Dallas, and KBMT Beaumont.
