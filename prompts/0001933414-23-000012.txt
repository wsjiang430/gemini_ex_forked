Item 1. Business
Business Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target diseases driven by abnormally elevated aldosterone. Our product candidate, lorundrostat, is a proprietary, orally administered, highly selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor (ASI) that we are initially developing for the treatment of patients with uncontrolled hypertension (uHTN), defined as individuals who are unable to achieve BP of below 130/80 mmHg despite taking two or more lines of antihypertensive medication or resistant hypertension (rHTN), defined as individuals who are unable to achieve BP of below 130/80 mmHg despite taking three or more antihypertensive medications typically including a diuretic. In the United States, there are over 115 million patients who have sustained elevated blood pressure (BP), or hypertension and more than half of this population fails to achieve their BP goals, defined as BP of 130/80 mmHg with currently available medications. There are over 30 million treated patients who do not achieve their BP goal, of whom approximately 20 million have systolic BP levels greater than 140 mmHg. Patients with hypertension that persists despite taking two or more medications have 1.8 and 2.5 times greater mortality risk due to either cardiovascular disease or stroke, respectively. In a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating 200 subjects with uHTN and rHTN (Target-HTN), lorundrostat demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in BP with once-daily dosing and was well tolerated. In addition to hypertension, we intend to develop lorundrostat for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and believe that our product candidate holds promise to be an innovative solution for the rapidly growing unmet need in multiple cardiorenal disorders.
Hypertension is one of the most common medical conditions globally, afflicting approximately 1.3 billion people and resulting in an estimated average of $130 billion annual economic burden in the United States alone between 2003 and 2014. Despite the availability of multiple treatment options, including thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), the prevalence of uHTN continues to grow, further exacerbated by the rapidly rising rate of obesity. Over 30 million hypertensive patients in the United States are unable to achieve their BP goal despite treatment. Within this population there are approximately 10.3 million patients suffering from rHTN. Multiple large-scale studies have demonstrated that patients who fail to achieve their BP goal have a significantly elevated risk of developing heart disease, stroke and kidney disease (Wright JT Jr, et al. A randomized trial of intensive versus standard blood-pressure control. N Engl J Med. 2015;373(22):2103-2116; and Zhou, et al., Uncontrolled Hypertension Increases Risk of All-Cause and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality in US Adults: the NHANES III Linked Mortality Study. Scientific Reports, 2018;8(1):1-7). Patients with rHTN have a 1.5 and 2.3 times higher risk than normotensive patients for composite cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease, respectively. Notwithstanding this significant and growing unmet need, there has been a lack of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved novel therapies targeting hypertension, with no new class of antihypertensive treatment approved within the last fifteen years.
Abnormally elevated aldosterone levels are a key factor in driving hypertension in approximately 25% of hypertensive patients. Developing an effective hypertension therapy that targets aldosterone synthase remains a significant challenge, given the tight homology between the enzymes that regulate aldosterone and cortisol synthesis, as well as aldosterone’s role in regulating potassium. Several large pharmaceutical companies have tried to develop ASIs, but their efforts have been hampered due to insufficient selectivity for aldosterone, resulting in off-target toxicities associated with cortisol inhibition. These challenges have led to the discontinuation of many ASIs in development to date.
Our Product Candidate, Lorundrostat
Our product candidate, lorundrostat, is a proprietary, orally administered, highly selective ASI that is designed to reduce aldosterone levels by inhibiting CYP11B2, the enzyme responsible for producing the hormone. We licensed lorundrostat from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceutical Company (Mitsubishi Tanabe), who discovered the compound and provided the early foundational work, including demonstrating the selectivity of lorundrostat, and progressing the asset through Phase 1 clinical development. We completed the Target-HTN trial, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for 
-1-


lorundrostat in the treatment of uHTN and rHTN in 2022. Given that hypertension and abnormal aldosterone biology can lead to cardiorenal disease, we intend to further develop lorundrostat across other indications such as the treatment of CKD.
*The first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of lorundrostat was conducted by Mitsubishi Tanabe. See “Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results” beginning on page 14 for additional details regarding this trial.
We may rely on the data from lorundrostat’s completed Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers and intend to use the observations from that trial and the Phase 2 trial in uHTN and rHTN to inform the development of lorundrostat for the treatment of CKD.
Target-HTN was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the United States across 200 subjects with uHTN and rHTN to evaluate the efficacy of lorundrostat at various doses either once or twice a day. All subjects were required to remain on background medications. 
Target-HTN Key Clinical Results
*Mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) results for 100mg QD Part1 and 50mg QD were -7.8 mmHg and -9.6 mmHg, respectively. The observed means include only those subjects with observations at visit eight with no imputation for missing values, while MMRM imputes missing values. The values for observed and MMRM means may differ slightly.
**Results from post-hoc sensitivity analysis reflecting subjects who passed Quality Control criteria and in whom both baseline AOBP and ABPM > 130mmHg.
The results of the Target-HTN trial demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant placebo-adjusted reduction in systolic BP, as measured by automated office blood pressure (AOBP), of 9.6 mmHg (p<0.01) and 7.8 mmHg (p<0.04) in the 50 mg and 100 mg once-daily (QD) cohorts, respectively. A p-value is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance, such that a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 means that there is a less than or equal to 5% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to chance. A p-value of 0.05 or less typically represents a statistically significant result. The FDA’s evidentiary standard when evaluating the results of a clinical trial generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05. In a meta-analysis of 147 randomized trials, a 10 mmHg reduction of systolic BP or a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP has been shown to reduce 
-2-


the risk of stroke by 41% and coronary heart disease by 22%. The reduction in systolic BP, as measured by AOBP, was validated and confirmed by comparable reductions in systolic BP with lorundrostat, as measured by 24-hour mean ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The ABPM data further demonstrated the benefits of lorundrostat on both central and nighttime BP reduction, which have been strongly linked to cardiovascular health risk. The trial results also highlighted that patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, or obese patients, who are at an elevated risk of cardiorenal diseases, exhibited a 12.3 or 16.7 mmHg placebo-adjusted reduction in systolic BP with a 100 mg QD or 50 mg QD dose, respectively. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in three subjects, one of which was deemed to be possibly related to lorundrostat in a subject with worsening of preexisting hyponatremia, which reversed after discontinuation. The two active, once-daily doses saw modest increases in potassium levels across the cohorts of 0.25 mmol/L with the 50 mg QD and 0.29 mmol/L with the 100 mg QD dose. Six subjects experienced transient elevated serum potassium greater than 6.0 mmol/L, none of which were considered an SAE, and all rapidly resolved after discontinuation or dose adjustment, which is consistent with the short half-life of lorundrostat. One of the events was assessed as erroneous due to sample misprocessing. As anticipated, and in a manner similar to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the BP lowering effect of lorundrostat led to a beneficial, reversible dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function. Finally, the selectivity of lorundrostat for aldosterone inhibition was confirmed as cortisol levels were not observed to be inhibited across the range of doses.
In November 2022, we held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA (i) to review the results of the Target-HTN trial, and (ii) to discuss our plans for a pivotal program in hypertension. Based on the Phase 2 results and feedback from the FDA, we intend to initiate the pivotal program noted below for lorundrostat beginning in 2023. 
We plan to initiate our ADVANCE-HTN trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to standardized background treatment of two or three antihypertensive medications in up to approximately 300 adult subjects. Patients will be randomized to three cohorts and treated for twelve weeks: lorundrostat 50 mg QD, lorundrostat 50mg QD and then titrated to 100 mg QD at week four or placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial will be change in systolic BP versus placebo. The topline data from this trial is expected in the first half of 2024. We also plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to background treatment of two or more antihypertensive medications in up to approximately 1,000 adults. The trial is expected to have a similar design as the above-described planned Phase 2 trial. The topline data from this trial is expected in mid-2025. We also plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in mid-2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN in a CKD population with topline data from this trial expected in the first half of 2024. The pivotal program will include an open label extension trial in which all subjects in the aforementioned trials will be given the opportunity to participate.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize lorundrostat for the treatment of diseases driven by abnormally elevated aldosterone, initially focused on hypertension, with the goal of eventually expanding to other cardiorenal diseases. Key elements of our strategy include: 
•Advance lorundrostat, our ASI product candidate, through clinical development for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN. uHTN and rHTN represent a significant unmet need within the 115 million patients in the United States who have hypertension. More than half of hypertensive patients fail to achieve their BP goals despite treatment, and approximately 20 million treated patients have systolic BP greater than 140 mmHg. Data from our Target-HTN Phase 2 trial demonstrated that lorundrostat lowered the systolic BP of patients with uHTN and rHTN at a clinically meaningful and statistically significant level, with a mean placebo-adjusted reduction in systolic BP of 9.6 or 7.8 mmHg with a 50 or 100 mg QD dose, respectively. Additionally, treatment with lorundrostat demonstrated a robust effect in obese patients, who, studies show, tend to have abnormal aldosterone biology. We believe our approach of normalizing aldosterone levels can provide an effective and more targeted approach for the control of hypertension. We plan to continue to advance the development of lorundrostat in hypertension and anticipate initiating two clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN in 2023, as well as an open label extension trial.
•Expand the development of lorundrostat into additional indications where abnormally elevated aldosterone is a driver in the disease pathology, including CKD and potentially other cardiorenal indications. Lorundrostat has been developed to normalize the production of aldosterone, and we believe this mechanism can be applied to other indications where abnormal aldosterone biology plays a role. We intend to initiate a 
-3-


Phase 2 uHTN and rHTN trial in a CKD population in mid-2023. Uninhibited aldosterone is known to play a critical role in the progression of CKD, which affects over 23 million people in the United States. Furthermore, we may expand the development of lorundrostat into additional cardiorenal indications.
•Opportunistically evaluate strategic partnerships to maximize the value of lorundrostat. We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to lorundrostat. Given the potential of aldosterone inhibition to treat multiple cardiorenal conditions, we may opportunistically explore partnerships with other biopharmaceutical companies that could provide expertise and resources to expand the development and commercialization of lorundrostat.
•Continue to evaluate opportunities to selectively expand our pipeline beyond lorundrostat. Our team has experience in various aspects of drug discovery, clinical development, business development and commercialization. We will continue to leverage our team’s expertise to selectively evaluate potential strategic partnerships, collaborations, licenses and acquisitions to expand our pipeline, particularly in cardiorenal indications.
Background of Hypertension 
In healthy individuals, normal BP, also known as peripheral blood pressure, is below 130 over 80, meaning the pressure measurement is lower than 130 mmHg when the heart is contracting (systolic BP) and at or below 80 mmHg when the heart is relaxed (diastolic BP). Sustained, elevated BP, or hypertension, can result in increased chances of life-threatening complications such as heart disease, stroke or kidney disease, among others. 
The prevalence of hypertension has been increasing in recent decades. A comprehensive study published in The Lancet journal shows that in patients aged 30 to 79, total hypertension cases nearly doubled worldwide from 1990 to 2019. Furthermore, obesity, especially when associated with increased visceral adiposity, is a major cause of hypertension, accounting for 65% to 75% of the risk for developing human primary (essential) hypertension. Despite hypertension being one of the most common preventable risk factors for premature death, approximately 1.3 billion people worldwide have hypertension, with hypertension as a primary or contributing cause to more than 670,000 deaths in the United States in 2020 alone. The costs of hypertension and related health issues are a major burden on already strained healthcare systems, with an estimated average of $130 billion annual economic burden in the United States alone between 2003 and 2014. While there are multiple therapeutic options available, most of which are generic and accessible, more than half of all treated hypertensive patients fail to achieve their BP goal. 
The current standard-of-care for patients newly diagnosed with hypertension is based on a set of guidelines set forth by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. A hypertensive patient’s target BP is defined as below 130/80 mmHg. Depending on baseline BP levels, these guidelines recommend the patient typically begin with lifestyle modifications and then, assuming BP does not achieve the desired target, initiate treatment with antihypertensive agents selected primarily from the following five drug classes, which may later be combined with each other if the patient's target BP is not successfully achieved with the initial therapy:
•Thiazide diuretics, which increase fluid excretion from the kidney by blocking reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the nephron;
•ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system axis by blocking the action of ACE in the lungs, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II;
•ARBs, which block the effects of angiotensin II at the level of the angiotensin receptor;
•Calcium channel blockers, which slow cardiac contractions and relax arteries by preventing calcium from entering the cells of the heart and arteries; and
•Beta blockers, which cause the heart to beat more slowly and with less force, which lowers BP.
Despite numerous available treatment options, the majority of hypertensive patients require multiple therapies to achieve their target BP. Evidence demonstrates that adding a second- or third-line antihypertensive agent typically provides an additional 6 to 7 mmHg reduction in systolic BP. However, the incremental reduction in systolic BP provided by successive lines of treatment does not always adequately enable patients to reach their BP goal. Therefore, many patients require three, four or more antihypertensive agents in an attempt to achieve their target BP. In addition, while hypertension is an asymptomatic disease, many of the currently available treatments have side effects and tolerability issues, which may 
-4-


limit their use. For example, patients taking ACE inhibitors often develop a chronic cough and those taking beta blockers often experience lethargy. 
In a meta-analysis of 147 randomized trials, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic BP or a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic BP has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by 41% and coronary heart disease by 22%. The Systolic BP Intervention Trial (SPRINT) study further demonstrated that in adults with hypertension but without diabetes, lowering systolic BP below 120 mmHg reduced cardiovascular events by 25% and reduced the overall risk of death by 27% compared to those with a systolic BP of 140 mmHg or higher. The importance of nighttime BP as a predictor of cardiovascular risk is increasingly recognized. Evidence has demonstrated that higher nighttime systolic BP has a strong association with increased cardiovascular risk. The study’s findings stress the importance of targeting a reduction in nighttime systolic BP when considering treatment approaches.
Over 30 million hypertensive patients in the United States are unable to achieve their BP goal despite treatment, and within this population, 10.3 million suffer from rHTN. Treatment options are limited for rHTN patients, and the current standard-of-care is to introduce an MRA agent, which blocks the effect of aldosterone, to their existing antihypertensive regimen. 
Background of Aldosterone and its Role in Hypertension 
Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid steroid hormone primarily made in the outer layer of the adrenal gland called the adrenal cortex, which plays an important role in controlling the balance of water and salts by keeping sodium in and releasing potassium from the body. This maintenance of homeostasis ensures the body can maintain normal BP.
In a healthy person, homeostatic balance is maintained via a feedback loop called the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). Renin is a key enzyme that is released by the kidneys when they sense changes in BP to control the production of aldosterone, in order to help the kidneys regulate water and salt levels in the body. In a normal physiological state, aldosterone production increases when BP is too low and decreases when BP is too high. This is considered renin-dependent hypertension due to the linkage of renin levels to aldosterone production.
In addition to the self-regulated RAAS, there are other pathways that drive aldosterone production. Evolving information about hormone regulation of visceral adipocytes and the adrenal gland support the hypothesis that adipokines, specifically elevated leptin and reduced adiponectin, can affect aldosterone and renin, respectively. The net result is an increase in aldosterone and prevention of the normal feedback inhibition of renin. This is considered renin-independent aldosterone production and is due to dysregulated systems biology, which is often prevalent in an obese population. 
Overview of Renin-Dependent and Renin-Independent Aldosterone Production
Elevated aldosterone also causes insulin resistance, inflammation and fibrosis of the heart, fibrosis and remodeling of blood vessels, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerular injury in the kidney. Aldosterone excess is believed to lead to a higher risk of stroke, kidney damage, congestive heart failure and heart attack, compared to high BP alone. Many of these symptoms are often comorbidities in an obese population.
Many of the therapies designed to address hypertension, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics, were developed and introduced several decades ago, when the incidence of obesity was 
-5-


below 20% and abnormal aldosterone production affected less than 10% of the U.S. population. The increasing prevalence of obesity and hypertension, driven by the renin-independent axis, has resulted in higher incidences of uHTN and rHTN. Currently available therapies are generally effective in managing renin-dependent hypertension; however they fail to adequately address the shifting biology of hypertension today. For example, ACE inhibitors and ARBs indirectly reduce aldosterone levels, but up to 40% of treated patients experience “aldosterone breakthrough,” whereby their aldosterone levels return to normal or higher levels and result in elevated BP. 
Growing Epidemic of Obesity Correlated to Rise in Hyperaldosteronism
MRAs, which were initially introduced in the 1950s, are designed to work by blocking the effect of aldosterone, whether renin-dependent or renin-independent, from the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) but do not inhibit aldosterone production. There are two well-known MRAs available in the United States for the treatment of hypertension, spironolactone and eplerenone, which are both available as generic medicines. MRAs are known to be effective in lowering BP; however, they have demonstrated side effects that have limited their use. Specifically, spironolactone, the most commonly prescribed MRA, is known for inducing hyperkalemia as well as gynecomastia in men and fertility issues in women. Additionally, when aldosterone is blocked from binding to the MR, circulating aldosterone levels increase two- to three-fold and may cause other harmful non-MR-related effects in the body.
More recently, several pharmaceutical companies have tried to develop ASIs. The approach of blocking the synthesis of aldosterone and reducing plasma aldosterone levels is thought to be a preferable approach versus the use of MRAs that block the action of aldosterone at the MR. However, the task of creating a safe and effective ASI proved to be technically challenging. The major enzymes in the synthesis of aldosterone and cortisol share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity. Therefore, an ASI needs to be very selective in inhibiting the synthesis of aldosterone without impacting the synthesis of cortisol. Initial attempts to develop ASIs failed in either preclinical or clinical development due to their inability to selectively inhibit aldosterone, which resulted in such ASIs inhibiting cortisol levels and leading to related harmful effects. 
Our Product Candidate, Lorundrostat
Our product candidate, lorundrostat, is a proprietary, orally administered, highly selective ASI designed to reduce aldosterone levels by inhibiting CYP11B2, the enzyme responsible for producing the hormone. We are initially developing lorundrostat for the treatment of hypertension and have recently completed Target-HTN, our initial Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial. In this trial, lorundrostat was well tolerated and demonstrated compelling clinical results, and once-daily dosing flexibility. The observed 10 to 12 hour half-life of lorundrostat has the potential to normalize aldosterone levels to provide a clinically meaningful reduction in BP, and to flexibly manage the challenges of elevated serum 
-6-


potassium. Some of the key differentiators that we have observed to date for lorundrostat, relative to initially developed ASIs, include:
•Compelling Clinical Results: Target-HTN demonstrated a statistically significant 9.6 mmHg and 7.8 mmHg reduction in systolic BP in the 50 mg and 100 mg QD cohorts, respectively, which we believe to be clinically meaningful. The reduction in systolic BP was validated and confirmed by 24-hour mean ABPM, which further demonstrated that lorundrostat provides both central and nighttime BP reduction;
•High Selectivity: Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data demonstrated high aldosterone selectivity with no cortisol suppression, as anticipated by the 374 to 1 inhibitory effect on the CYP11B2 enzyme compared to the CYP11B1 enzyme, which is responsible for synthesizing cortisol;
•Optimal Half-Life: A majority of our clinical trial subjects maintained a serum potassium in the normal range. There were modest incidences of hyperkalemia requiring dose adjustment or discontinuation. Six subjects experienced transient elevated serum potassium greater than 6.0 mmol/L, none of which were considered an SAE and all rapidly resolved after discontinuation or dose adjustment. One of the events was assessed as erroneous due to sample misprocessing. lorundrostat’s observed 10 to 12 hour half-life may be viewed more favorably by physicians compared to compounds with longer half-lives, which may have greater risk of sustained potassium elevation; and
•Convenient Dosing and Well Tolerated: Target-HTN demonstrated clinically meaningful results on a once-daily dosing regimen. Furthermore, lorundrostat was well-tolerated.
We plan to initiate our ADVANCE-HTN trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to standardized background treatment of two or three antihypertensive medications in up to approximately 300 adult subjects. Patients will be randomized to three cohorts and treated for twelve weeks: lorundrostat 50 mg QD, lorundrostat 50mg QD and then titrated to 100 mg QD at week four or placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial will be change in systolic BP versus placebo. The topline data from this trial is expected in the first half of 2024. We also plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to background treatment of two or more antihypertensive medications in up to approximately 1,000 adults. The trial is expected to have a similar design as the above-described planned Phase 2 trial. The topline data from this trial is expected in mid-2025. We also plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in mid-2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN in a CKD population with topline data from this trial expected in the first half of 2024. The pivotal program will include an open label extension in which all subjects in the aforementioned trials will be given the opportunity to participate.
Target-HTN Phase 2 Clinical Trial
Target-HTN was a two-part Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of orally administered lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to stable background treatment of two or more antihypertensive medications in 200 males and females. The trial was conducted in the United States.
The objectives of the Target-HTN trial were the following:
•Proof-of-concept for the use of lorundrostat in patients with uHTN and rHTN;
•Establishing the dose range and regimen for late-stage development;
•Determining whether clinical results support a once-a-day dosing regimen;
•Evaluating hypothesized predictors of clinical response, specifically obesity and plasma renin activity, as potentially useful strategies for prioritizing the use of lorundrostat as a targeted therapy for hypertension; 
•Characterizing safety and establishing an initial estimate of the benefit/risk profile; and
•Evaluating exploratory endpoints that may be predictive of future utility of lorundrostat in associated cardiorenal indications such as congestive heart failure and CKD.

The trial was conducted in two parts. In Part 1, subjects were initially pre-screened for a period of up to two weeks with a requirement for their systolic/diastolic BP to be over 130/80 mmHg with the use of two or more background medications indicated for hypertension such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers or diuretics. Subjects in Part 1 were also required to have low-renin hypertension defined as hypertension with a plasma renin activity level of 1.0 ng/mL/h or less. Subjects were excluded if they were taking an MRA or sodium channel blocker. Once subjects met the prescreening criteria, they were followed for two weeks during a blinded, placebo run-in period where their elevated BP was reconfirmed while compliant on background medication and placebo. If patients were compliant on their background medication and continued to have BP above 130/80 mmHg, subjects were randomized in five active cohorts and one placebo cohort. Subjects were dosed for eight weeks, then, upon withdrawal of study medication, followed for another four weeks.
Baseline Demographics of the Patients Enrolled in Target-HTN Part 1 — Full Analysis Set (FAS)
We conducted a pre-planned interim analysis for Part 1 of the trial when approximately one-third (65 subjects) of the planned enrollment had completed a minimum of four weeks of treatment, representing approximately 10-12 subjects per cohort. To preserve the blinding of the trial, the interim analysis was conducted by a small team that was not involved in operational aspects of the trial and no results of the analysis were shared with the operational team at clinical trial sites. The primary purpose of the interim analysis was to assess whether the chosen dose range appeared to adequately span the range from sub-therapeutic to maximum therapeutic response determined by change in systolic BP at week four relative to baseline. As a result of the interim analysis, we discontinued further enrollment in two of the lower dose cohorts (12.5 mg QD and 12.5 mg BID) due to the modest efficacy and projected benefit/risk ratio and initiated Part 2 of the trial. 
Part 2 was designed to study the effect of lorundrostat in subjects with normal-to-high renin levels, and we selected 100 mg QD as the dose to study based on its efficacy and safety as demonstrated in the interim analysis. Subjects 
-8-


enrolled in Part 2 were randomized to either 100 mg of lorundrostat once-daily (n=31) or placebo (n=6) to preserve the blinded randomization of the trial. The Part 2 subjects followed the same study conduct as Part 1 subjects, with the exception of the follow up period, which was shortened from four weeks to two weeks. 
The primary endpoint of Target-HTN was change in seated, pre-dose morning systolic BP at week 8 versus baseline reading as measured by AOBP. The pre-planned analysis of the primary endpoint was an MMRM. Between Part 1 and Part 2, 100 mg QD, the pre-planned comparison of the primary endpoint was an unpaired, two-tailed T-test, using the observed change from baseline to week 8. Secondary endpoints included 24-hour ABPM change at week 8 versus baseline, diastolic BP change at week 8 versus baseline and proportion of subjects achieving BP goal at week 8. For the purpose of evaluating safety, findings from the 100 mg QD cohorts from Parts 1 and 2 were pooled.
Phase 2 Target-HTN Clinical Trial Design
BID = twice-daily; EOT = end of treatment; FU = follow up; PRA = plasma renin activity; QD = once-daily
Efficacy
The outcomes of the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of lorundrostat, as shown in the chart below, demonstrated efficacy across defined endpoints and was well tolerated in once-daily dosing.
The primary endpoint for Part 1 of Target-HTN was the change in systolic BP at week 8 relative to baseline. As indicated in the table below, in an intent-to-treat analysis, lorundrostat showed a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP, which we believe to be clinically meaningful, in a dose-dependent manner. The once-daily doses of 50 mg and 100 mg of lorundrostat demonstrated comparable reduction in systolic BP, as compared to the twice-daily dosing of lorundrostat with either 12.5 mg or 25 mg of lorundrostat. The higher doses of both once-daily and twice-daily lorundrostat also generated a reduction in diastolic BP over the course of the trial, which we believe to be clinically meaningful.
Target-HTN Efficacy Data, as Measured by AOBP
In Part 2, 31 subjects with normal or elevated renin were treated with once-daily lorundrostat at 100 mg QD and assessed similarly to those in Part 1. The reduction in systolic BP in Part 2 of this trial was not statistically different from 
-9-


the reduction seen in Part 1 (see figure below). As a result, we believe that lorundrostat has the potential to be effective across the entire range of renin levels.
Individual Change in BP at Week 8
*N = subjects with baseline and week 8 data, modeled mean using FAS.
A further predefined objective of this trial was to evaluate potential predictors of clinical response to lorundrostat. There was no consistent difference in clinical response to lorundrostat observed based on gender, race, age, or number of baseline antihypertensive medicines. Our analysis of the clinical results demonstrated the following determinants to be positively correlated to clinical response:
•Obesity. Hypertensive subjects with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 demonstrated a significant reduction of systolic BP with a placebo-adjusted reduction of 16.7 mmHg with 50 mg QD and a reduction of 12.3 mmHg with 100 mg QD in Part 1 of the study. The obesity finding, in particular, lends support to our hypothesis of the linkage between obesity-leptin-aldosterone axis and hypertension; and
•Use of diuretics. Subjects taking a diuretic as a part of their background regimen demonstrated a significant reduction of systolic BP with a placebo-adjusted reduction of 12.9 mmHg with 50 mg QD, 10.0 mmHg with 100 mg QD in Part 1 of the study.

Placebo-Adjusted Improvement in Systolic BP by Responder Determinant
During two periods of time in the study, the week prior to randomization and the last week of study drug treatment, subjects were required to wear a device that captures BP readings multiple times per hour over a 24 hour period. This measurement provides a more complete picture of the patient’s hypertension status than in-office measurements and eliminates the impact of the phenomenon known as “white coat” hypertension, which occurs when BP readings at a healthcare provider’s office are higher than in other settings such as at home. The change in 24-hour systolic ABPM from baseline to week 7 or 8 for the Part 1 100 mg QD cohort, demonstrated an 8.1 mmHg observed mean placebo-adjusted reduction in systolic BP. The ABPM response in the 50 mg QD was complicated by evidence of “white coat” hypertension, but after eliminating data from individuals who were not hypertensive, as measured by ABPM, there was evidence of a 10.5 mmHg observed mean placebo-adjusted reduction in systolic BP in individuals who were hypertensive as measured by ABPM (the 50mg QD hypertensive ABPM set). The average overnight BP reduction in the 100 mg QD cohort was an observed mean placebo-adjusted reduction of 8.0 mmHg and in the 50 mg QD hypertensive ABPM set there was an observed mean placebo-adjusted reduction of 4.1 mmHg. 
The reduction in overnight BP and restoration of dipping that was also observed are of potential importance to the objective of reducing morbidity and mortality from uHTN, as the link between elevated nighttime BP and cardiovascular risk has been long established in the medical literature. 
Single Subject in Part 1 of Target-HTN Demonstrated Reduction in Average 24-Hour BP
The above reflects a treatment-responsive subject in Part 1 receiving lorundrostat 100 mg QD (purple tracing) versus baseline (light blue tracing) showing average 24-hour BP reduction and restoration of normal nocturnal dipping pattern. Gaps in tracings represent missing measurements due to technical reasons, such as cuff slipping off. Although not every patient will experience similar results, we believe the above data is indicative of a patient who has responded favorably to lorundrostat.

Central BP is the pressure in the aorta, the large artery that sends blood from the heart throughout the body. Many experts believe that central BP is a useful measurement because central BP may be a more accurate way of predicting if a person will have heart disease or stroke. The central BP reading in this trial was captured using the 24-hour ABPM via an integrated software package that measures the pulse waveform and thus obtains central BP measurements. As indicated below, lorundrostat at doses of 100 mg and 50 mg once-daily demonstrated relevant reductions in central BP, which we believe to be clinically meaningful, with placebo-adjusted reductions in central systolic BP of 10.0 mmHg for 100 mg QD and 10.4 mmHg for the 50 mg QD hypertensive ABPM set. The placebo-adjusted reductions in central diastolic BP were 5.9 mmHg for 100 mg QD and 4.2 mmHg for the 50 mg QD hypertensive ABPM set.
Lorundrostat Effect on Systolic and Central Systolic BP
*Results from post-hoc sensitivity analysis reflecting subjects who passed Quality Control criteria and in whom both baseline AOBP and ABPM > 130mmHg. 
The eGFR measures how well an individual’s kidneys are filtering waste and extra water from the body via the urine. In hypertensive patients, the eGFR will progressively decline and individuals may begin to exhibit signs and symptoms of CKD at eGFR levels below 45mL/min/1.73m2. As demonstrated in previous studies with antihypertensives, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, an initial reduction of eGFR in treated hypertensive patients may represent a positive benefit as it indicates an alleviation of pressure on the glomerulus and potentially slows or arrests the progression to CKD. In this trial, a dose-dependent reduction in eGFR was demonstrated, which we believe is clinically meaningful and has the potential to provide a renal protection benefit that we intend to further assess in future clinical trials.
Safety
Lorundrostat has been observed to be well-tolerated, specifically in four key measures that we believe to be of special interest when evaluating the safety of lorundrostat:
•Cortisol Inhibition: As shown in the chart below, there was no clinically relevant suppression of cortisol production in serum cortisol testing as well as ACTH-stimulation testing. A slight increase in cortisol was observed in all cohorts, including placebo, but did not demonstrate a trend above normal physiological levels;
-12-


No Meaningful Inhibition of Cortisol Observed in Target-HTN
Serum Cortisol
•Hypotension (sitting systolic BP < 100 mmHg): Hypotension and orthostatic hypotension was seen in three and three subjects, respectively, and was reversible, likely related to study medication and expected based on lorundrostat’s mechanism of action; 
•Hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mmol/L): Severe hyponatremia, possibly related to study medication, was seen in one subject with preexisting hyponatremia, and was reversible after drug discontinuation; and 
•Hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.1 mmol/L): There was an expected, dose-dependent increase in serum potassium, though the majority of subjects maintained a serum potassium in the normal range. The two active, once-daily doses saw modest increases in potassium levels across the cohorts of 0.25 mmol/L with the 50 mg QD and 0.29 mmol/L with the 100 mg QD dose. Six subjects across the five active dose cohorts experienced an isolated instance of elevated potassium above 6 mmol/L (two were deemed to be a factitious reading, three worsening of pre-existing hyperkalemia and one was a confirmed de-novo episode of hyperkalemia). Consistent with the short terminal elimination half-life of lorundrostat, all episodes were rapidly reversible after per protocol dose reduction, temporarily holding study medication or treatment discontinuation. An independent data safety monitoring board expressed no concerns about the effect of lorundrostat on serum potassium in the Target-HTN trial.
Based on the totality of available data, there have been no safety concerns that prompted changes to the IB or protocol. Three SAEs, including one event of chest pain, one event of metastases to peritoneum and one event of hyponatremia, were reported and treatment discontinued. Hyponatremia was assessed as possibly related to the study drug. The other two events were assessed as unrelated to the study drug. To date, the most frequent non-serious AEs reported, defined as events with five or more affected subjects, including the placebo group, were related to hyperkalemia – all determinations above upper limit of normal of 5.1 mmol/L (23.3%), decreased glomerular filtration (6.8%), urinary tract infections (5.3%) and hypertension (3.8%). In some of the hyperkalemia events, study treatment was dose adjusted temporarily or permanently discontinued according to safety guidelines in the protocol.
Pharmacokinetics 
The 24-hour exposure/response relationship for systolic BP at week 8 across treatment groups suggests QD dosing up to 100 mg. The trial results suggest a minimal effective dose between 12.5 mg/24 hours and 25 mg/24 hours (12.5mg BID) and a maximum efficacious dose of 50 mg to 100 mg QD for lorundrostat. All doses in excess of 12.5 mg QD are active doses, which is to be expected. Given the relatively short half-life of lorundrostat, the group mean exposure in the 25 
-13-


mg BID and 50 mg QD cohorts was similar, suggesting little drug accumulation. The comparable efficacy of the 25 mg BID and 50 mg QD cohorts suggests that once-daily dosing is sufficient to achieve maximum blood pressure reduction.
Exposure Versus Change in Systolic BP
Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results
The Phase 1 program of lorundrostat consisted of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human trial to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of lorundrostat in healthy subjects, including the effect of gender and age on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of lorundrostat in healthy subjects. This trial was conducted by Mitsubishi Tanabe in the Netherlands and the trial data was used to support our open IND, under which our current lorundrostat development program is being conducted. We submitted the IND in February 2021, which was allowed to proceed by the FDA in March 2021.
Lorundrostat was well-tolerated at single and multiple doses in the first-in-human trial. No deaths or other SAEs were observed. One subject in the Part 2 MAD trial, 360 mg dose group discontinued treatment due to a treatment-emergent AE of sinus tachycardia. Across all cohorts, dizziness/dizziness postural was reported by 9 out of 87 (10.3%) lorundrostat-treated subjects compared to 1 out of 29 (3.4%) placebo subjects.
The high selectivity of lorundrostat was demonstrated in both the single ascending dose (SAD) and MAD parts of this trial. It was shown that lorundrostat decreased plasma aldosterone concentration in a dose-dependent manner in the SAD portion of the trial with a 36-77% reduction in 24-hour serum aldosterone at doses ranging from 5 mg to 800 mg. This finding was further validated in the MAD part of the trial with 40 mg, 120 mg and 360 mg reducing 24-hour serum aldosterone in a dose-dependent manner. In the SAD trial lorundrostat did not inhibit cortisol production across the range of doses and in the MAD study cortisol was not inhibited even with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cortisol stimulation challenge on day six. The results of this trial demonstrated the selectivity for aldosterone synthase with lorundrostat.
The impact on age and gender was also evaluated in the Phase 1 program for lorundrostat. It was demonstrated that neither of these sub-groups exhibited differentiated exposure levels to lorundrostat.
A Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence study to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of lorundrostat in healthy subjects has been completed. Based on the results of this trial, lorundrostat can be administered without regard to meals in all ongoing and future clinical trials as well as upon approval in hypertensive patients.
We have also completed drug interaction studies with lorundrostat with metformin and esomeprazole. The metformin study was completed based on the possible inhibition of the MATE1 metabolic pathway by lorundrostat. MATE1 is one of four pathways for metformin metabolism. This trial demonstrated that lorundrostat has little effect on metformin and based on the minimal increases in metformin concentrations, lorundrostat is not expected to be viewed as even a weak inhibitor of metformin based on FDA definitions. The DDI study with esomeprazole was to evaluate the effect 
-14-


of varying gastric pH levels on the absorption and availability of lorundrostat. As anticipated for lorundrostat, which is a weak base, there was reduced absorption in the alkaline gastric environment produced by the proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Further studies will be performed to provide labeling guidelines for timing vis-à-vis meals or dose-adjustment of lorundrostat for individuals using a PPI.
Preclinical Data
The pharmacological profile for lorundrostat was assessed via in vitro pharmacology studies that demonstrated a selectivity ratio of 374 times more selective for aldosterone inhibition over cortisol inhibition. Lorundrostat inhibited hCYP11B2, the synthetic pathway for aldosterone, and hCYP11B1, the synthetic pathway of cortisol with inhibition constant values of 1.27 nmol/L and 475 nmol/L, respectively. 
Single-dose oral administration of lorundrostat significantly decreased plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in a sodium-depleted non-human primate model. However, single-dose oral administration of lorundrostat did not affect PACs in ACTH-loaded non-human primates even at a dose 100-fold higher than those required to reduce PAC. These results indicate that lorundrostat inhibits CYP11B2 with higher selectivity over CYP11B1, an enzyme responsible for cortisol production.
Future Clinical Development Plans
In November 2022, we held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA (i) to review the results of the Target-HTN trial, and (ii) to discuss our plans for a pivotal program in hypertension. The FDA agreed that the preclinical and clinical pharmacology plan supports an NDA, that the Target-HTN data supports the pivotal study program, and the proposed doses and clinical trial designs would support an indication for hypertension. Based on the Phase 2 results and feedback from the FDA, we intend to initiate the pivotal program noted below for lorundrostat beginning in 2023. 
We plan to initiate our ADVANCE-HTN trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to standardized background treatment of two or three antihypertensive medications in up to approximately 300 adult subjects. Patients will be randomized to three cohorts and treated for twelve weeks: lorundrostat 50 mg QD, lorundrostat 50mg QD and then titrated to 100 mg QD at week four or placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial will be change in systolic BP versus placebo. The topline data from this trial is expected in the first half of 2024. We also plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN, when used as an add-on therapy to background treatment of two or more antihypertensive medications in up to approximately 1,000 adults. The trial is expected to have a similar design as the above-described planned Phase 2 trial. The topline data from this trial is expected in mid-2025. We also plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in mid-2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN in a CKD population with topline data from this trial expected in the first half of 2024. The pivotal program will include an open label extension trial in which all subjects in the aforementioned trials will be given the opportunity to participate.
Additional Indications
We also plan to expand the development of lorundrostat into additional indications where abnormally elevated aldosterone is a driver in the disease pathology, including CKD. Uninhibited aldosterone is known to play a critical role in the progression of CKD, which affects over 23 million people in the United States. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial in mid-2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat for the treatment of uHTN and rHTN in a CKD population with topline data from this trial expected in the first half of 2024. In the future, we may expand into other cardiorenal indications driven by abnormally elevated aldosterone.

Mineralys’ License Agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation 
In July 2020, we entered into a license agreement (the Mitsubishi License) with Mitsubishi Tanabe, pursuant to which Mitsubishi Tanabe granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under Mitsubishi Tanabe’s patent and other intellectual property rights to exploit products incorporating lorundrostat (formerly MT-4129) (Lorundrostat Products) for the prevention, treatment, diagnosis, detection, monitoring or predisposition testing with respect to indications, diseases and conditions in humans (the Field). We paid Mitsubishi Tanabe a $1.0 million upfront fee, and we are obligated to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe development milestone payments of up to $9.0 million in the aggregate and commercial milestone payments of up to $155.0 million in the aggregate upon first commercial sale and upon meeting certain annual sales targets, as well as additional commercial milestone payments of up to $10.0 million for a second indication. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Mitsubishi Tanabe tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to ten percent (10%) of aggregate net sales of each Lorundrostat Product on a Lorundrostat Product-by-Lorundrostat Product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid Mitsubishi Tanabe patent claim covering a Lorundrostat Product, (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of a Lorundrostat Product, or (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country. Such royalties are subject to reduction under specified conditions, including lack of patent coverage and generic competition. 
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete the development activities and to file for regulatory approval for at least one Lorundrostat Product in a major market country and consider in good faith to develop at least one Lorundrostat Product in a non-major market country. If we elect to sublicense our rights under the Mitsubishi License to a third party with respect to exploitation of lorundrostat or any Lorundrostat Product in certain countries in Asia, Mitsubishi Tanabe has a right of first negotiation, for a specified period of time. We also agreed not to commercialize any competing product prior to three years following the first commercial sale of the first Lorundrostat Product in any country without Mitsubishi Tanabe’s prior consent. 
Unless terminated earlier, the Mitsubishi License will continue until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations to Mitsubishi Tanabe. We may terminate the Mitsubishi License for any or no reason upon 90 or 180 days’ prior written notice to Mitsubishi Tanabe depending on whether the Lorundrostat Product has received regulatory approval. Mitsubishi Tanabe may terminate the Mitsubishi License if we have not initiated regulatory consultation for the first global clinical trials of lorundrostat in at least one major market country within a specified amount of time or if we or our affiliates or sublicensees initiate a challenge to the patent rights licensed to us by Mitsubishi Tanabe. In addition, either party may terminate the Mitsubishi License in the event of an uncured material breach by or bankruptcy of the other party, subject to certain notice and cure periods, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. 
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of lorundrostat, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finished product candidates for our clinical trials. We do not have any current contractual arrangements for the manufacture of commercial supplies of lorundrostat. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors.
Sales and Marketing
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for lorundrostat because it is still in clinical development. Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force, or the establishment of our own commercial sales force. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for lorundrostat, if any. 
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. Lorundrostat, if approved, may address multiple markets. Ultimately, the disease(s) lorundrostat targets and for which it may receive marketing authorization will determine our competition. There are competing programs under development by other companies for our initially targeted indication of hypertension. Lorundrostat, if approved, will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, biotechnological and therapeutics companies. In many cases, the companies with competing programs will have access to greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources, will have more expertise and experience than us, and may be more advanced in those programs. Moreover, we 
-16-


may also compete with universities and other research institutions that may be active in research in our target indications and could be in direct competition with us. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We believe our current and future competition can be grouped into three broad categories:
•Companies working to develop ASIs, including AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Damian Pharma and PhaseBio;
•Companies with product candidates with other mechanisms of action, including Alnylam, Idorsia, Ionis, KBP BioSciences, Quantum Genomics and Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group; and
•Companies commercializing standard-of-care antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers, many of which are available as generic medicines at very low prices including AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis and Pfizer.
If we successfully obtain approval for lorundrostat or any future product candidate, we believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the success of lorundrostat will be efficacy, safety, tolerability, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors relative to such competing products. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors have products that are superior in one or more of these categories. 
Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, is important to our business. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary intellectual property protection for our clinical-stage product candidate, lorundrostat, as well as for future product candidates and novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how. Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position by, among other methods, licensing or filing U.S. and foreign patents and applications relating to our product candidates, technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
Our patent portfolio is built with a goal of establishing broad protection that generally includes, for the product candidate compound, claims directed to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions or formulations, methods of synthesis, and methods of treatment using such pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. We are seeking and maintaining patent protection in the United States and key foreign jurisdictions where we intend to market lorundrostat. Our patent portfolio includes a combination of patents and patent applications solely owned by us, patents and pending patent applications licensed from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or Mitsubishi Tanabe, and pending patent applications jointly owned with Mitsubishi Tanabe. As of February 16, 2023, our patent portfolio comprises 9 distinct patent families protecting our technology relating to lorundrostat and its synthetic intermediates, methods of synthesizing lorundrostat and related compounds, various formulations of lorundrostat products, as well as methods of treating diseases with lorundrostat and related compounds. As of February 16, 2023, our portfolio of exclusively licensed patents and pending patent applications consists of four granted U.S. patents; one granted European patent that has been validated in Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom; one granted European patent that has been validated in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom; one pending European application; four granted Japanese patents; one granted Canadian patent; one granted Australian patent; one pending Brazilian application; one granted Chinese patent; one granted Indian patent; one granted Indonesian patent; one granted Korean patent; one granted Malaysian patent; one granted Mexican patent; two granted Russian patents; one granted Singaporean patent; one granted Taiwanese patent; one pending Thai application; one granted Vietnamese patent; and one pending PCT International Application. 
Our portfolio of wholly owned pending patent applications consists of one pending PCT International Application and three pending U.S. provisional patent applications.
Our portfolio of jointly owned pending patent applications consists of two pending PCT International Applications and one pending U.S. provisional patent application.
Granted patents and pending applications in our portfolio of exclusively licensed patents and pending patent applications, if granted, have nominal expiration dates ranging from 2035 to about 2042, without accounting for any 
-17-


available patent term adjustments or extensions. Pending applications in our portfolio of wholly and jointly owned pending patent applications have nominal expiration dates ranging from 2041 to about 2042, without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions. If filed and subsequently granted, patent applications claiming priority to pending U.S. Provisional Applications in our portfolio of wholly and jointly owned pending patent applications will have expiration dates ranging from 2042 to 2043, without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
The term of individual patents in our portfolio depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent may be eligible for patent term adjustment, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for delays incurred at the USPTO during the patent prosecution process. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While the length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent per approved drug may be extended under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek any available patent term extension to any granted patents we may be granted in any jurisdiction where such extensions are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, granted patents do not guarantee the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Granted patents only allow us to block potential competitors from practicing the claimed inventions of the granted patents.
Further, patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our granted patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any granted patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any granted patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
We may also rely on trade secrets relating to our discovery programs and product candidates, and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us, and for employees and consultants to enter into invention assignment agreements with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Where applicable, the agreements provide that all inventions to which the individual contributed as an inventor shall be assigned to us, and as such, will become our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.

Further, we have and will continue to pursue trademark protection for our company name and brand. As of December 27, 2022, we owned four registered trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions relating to the registered trademark “MINERALYS.”
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (NDA) process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice regulations (GLPs) and other applicable regulations; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), or ethics committee (EC) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations (GCPs) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of potential inspection of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. An IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial includes an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and a separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the 
-19-


last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Furthermore, an independent IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
•Phase 1:    The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
•Phase 2:    The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. 
•Phase 3:    The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMPs. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
U.S. Review and Approval Process 
The results of product development, preclinical and other nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
-20-


The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Orphan Drug Designation 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, 
-21-


the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of a competing product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the “same drug,” as defined by the FDA, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same disease or condition. In addition, if an orphan-designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of a marketing application for a new drug. For example, the fast track designation program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process of developing and reviewing product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, investigational drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation or breakthrough designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. 
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials. Drugs receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory trials in a timely manner or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition of accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
-22-


Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws and regulations. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of requirements for post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
Marketing Exclusivity 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first 
-23-


applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (505(b)(2) NDA) submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to, all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. 
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security and physician and other healthcare provider transparency laws and regulations. If our significant operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. 
-24-


The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. By way of example, the ACA:
•increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price;
•required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
•required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
•imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation and executive orders issued by the President designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
