Item 1. Business
General
National Storage Affiliates Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust organized in the state of Maryland on May 16, 2013. We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We serve as the sole general partner of our operating partnership subsidiary, NSA OP, LP (our "operating partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 13, 2013 to conduct our business, which is focused on the ownership, operation, and acquisition of self storage properties located within the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas ("MSAs") throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we held ownership interests in and operated a geographically diversified portfolio of 675 self storage properties, located in 34 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 43.0 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 345,000 storage units. According to the 2019 Self-Storage Almanac, we are the fifth largest owner and operator of self storage properties in the United States based on number of properties, self storage units, and rentable square footage. We completed our initial public offering in 2015 and our common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NSA."
Our chairman and chief executive officer, Arlen D. Nordhagen, co-founded SecurCare Self Storage, Inc. in 1988 to invest in and manage self storage properties. While growing SecurCare to over 150 self storage properties, Mr. Nordhagen recognized a market opportunity for a differentiated public self storage REIT that would leverage the benefits of national scale by integrating multiple experienced regional self storage operators with local operational focus and expertise. We believe that his vision, which is the foundation of the Company, aligns the interests of our participating regional operators ("PROs"), with those of our public shareholders by allowing our PROs to participate alongside our shareholders in our financial performance and the performance of our PROs' "managed portfolios", which means, with respect to each PRO, the portfolio of properties that such PRO manages on our behalf. A key component of this strategy is to capitalize on the local market expertise and knowledge of regional self storage operators by maintaining the continuity of their roles as property managers.
We believe that our structure creates the right financial incentives to accomplish these objectives. We require our PROs to exchange the self storage properties they contribute to the Company for a combination of OP units and subordinated performance units in our operating partnership or subsidiaries of our operating partnership that issue units intended to be economically equivalent to the OP units and subordinated performance units issued by our operating partnership ("DownREIT partnerships"). OP units, which are economically equivalent to our common shares, create alignment with the performance of the Company as a whole. Subordinated performance units, which are linked to the performance of specific managed portfolios, incentivize our PROs to drive operating performance and support the 
5

sustainability of the operating cash flow generated by the self storage properties that they manage on our behalf. Because subordinated performance unit holders receive distributions only after portfolio-specific minimum performance thresholds are satisfied, subordinated performance units play a key role in aligning the interests of our PROs with us and our shareholders. Our structure thus offers PROs a unique opportunity to serve as regional property managers for their managed portfolios and directly participate in the potential upside of those properties while simultaneously diversifying their investment to include a broader portfolio of self storage properties. We believe our structure provides us with a competitive growth advantage over self storage companies that do not offer property owners the ability to participate in the performance and potential future growth of their managed portfolios.
We believe that our national platform has significant potential for continued external and internal growth. We seek to further expand our platform by continuing to recruit additional established self storage operators as well as opportunistically partnering with institutional funds and other institutional investors in strategic joint venture arrangements while integrating our operations through the implementation of centralized initiatives, including management information systems, revenue enhancement, and cost optimization programs. We are currently engaged in preliminary discussions with additional self storage operators and believe that we could add one to three PROs in addition to the ten PROs we have currently identified, which will enhance our existing geographic footprint and allow us to enter regional markets in which we currently have limited or no market share. 
Our PROs 
The Company had eight PROs as of December 31, 2018: SecurCare Self Storage, Inc. and its controlled affiliates ("SecurCare"), Kevin Howard Real Estate Inc., d/b/a Northwest Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Northwest"), Optivest Properties LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Optivest"), Guardian Storage Centers LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Guardian"), Move It Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Move It"), Arizona Mini Storage Management Company d/b/a Storage Solutions and its controlled affiliates ("Storage Solutions"), Hide-Away Storage Services, Inc. and its controlled affiliates ("Hide-Away") and an affiliate of Shader Brothers Corporation d/b/a Personal Mini Storage ("Personal Mini"). 
In October 2018, we entered into definitive agreements with affiliates of Southern Self Storage, LLC d/b/a Southern Self Storage of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, to add Southern Self Storage ("Southern") as our ninth PRO. In January 2019, we completed the initial contribution transaction with Southern, which included the acquisition of six self storage properties by us. In addition, in February 2019, we entered into definitive agreements with affiliates of Investment Real Estate Management, LLC d/b/a Moove In Self Storage of York, Pennsylvania to add Moove In Self Storage ("Moove In") as our tenth PRO. Moove In is led by John Gilliland, a past Chairman of the national Self Storage Association. Moove In currently owns 19 self storage properties in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York. Upon closing, Moove In intends to contribute six self storage properties to us as part of the initial contribution transaction, and its remaining properties will be added to our captive pipeline. We expect the initial contribution transaction and related closing documentation, including the entry into a facilities portfolio management agreement, to close during the first quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. 
 To capitalize on their recognized and established local brands, our PROs continue to function as property managers for their managed portfolios under their existing brands (which include various brands in addition to those discussed below). Over the long-run, we may seek to brand or co-brand each location as part of NSA. 

• | SecurCare, which is headquartered in Lone Tree, Colorado, has been operating since 1988 and is one of our PROs responsible for covering the west, mountain, midwest and southeast regions. SecurCare provided property management services to 207 of our properties located in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas as of December 31, 2018. SecurCare is currently managed by David Cramer, who has worked in the self storage industry for more than 20 years.


• | Northwest, which is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is our PRO responsible for covering the northwest region. Northwest provided property management services to 75 of our properties located in Oregon and Washington as of December 31, 2018. Northwest is run by Kevin Howard, one of our trustees, who founded the company over 30 years ago and is recognized in the industry for his successful track record as a self storage specialist in the areas of design and development, operations and property management, consultation, and brokerage.


• | Optivest, which is based in Dana Point, California, is one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of the northeast and southwest regions. Optivest managed 57 of our properties located in Arizona, California,

6

Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Texas as of December 31, 2018. Optivest is run by its co-founder, Warren Allan, who has more than 25 years of financial and operational management experience in the self storage industry and is recognized as a self storage acquisition and development specialist. 

• | Guardian, which is based in Irvine, California, is one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of the southern California and southwest regions. Guardian managed 54 of our properties located in California, Arizona and Nevada as of December 31, 2018. Guardian is led by John Minar, who has nearly 40 years of self storage acquisition, rehabilitation, ownership, operations and development experience.


• | Move It, which is based in Dallas, Texas, is one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of the Texas and southeast markets. Move It managed 29 of our properties located in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas as of December 31, 2018. Move It is led by its founder, Tracy Taylor, who has more than 40 years of experience in self storage development, acquisition and management, and is currently on the board of directors for the Large Owners Council of the Self Storage Association and is a former Chairman of the national Self Storage Association.


• | Storage Solutions, which is based in Chandler, Arizona, is our PRO responsible for covering portions of the Arizona and Nevada markets. Storage Solutions managed 10 of our properties in Arizona and Nevada as of December 31, 2018. Storage Solutions is led by its founder, Bill Bohannan, who is one of the largest operators in Phoenix and has more than 35 years of self storage acquisition, development and management experience. Mr. Bohannan is recognized in the industry as a self storage acquisition, development and management specialist. 


• | Hide-Away, which is based in Sarasota, Florida, is our PRO responsible for covering the western Florida market. Hide-Away managed 21 of our properties in western Florida as of December 31, 2018. Hide-Away is led by its founder, Steve Wilson, one of the early developers of the self storage business, who served for more than 35 years as the President of Hide-Away and its related entities, and is a former Chairman of the national Self-Storage Association. 


• | Personal Mini, which is based in Orlando, Florida, is our PRO responsible for covering portions of the central Florida market. Personal Mini managed seven of our properties in central Florida as of December 31, 2018. Personal Mini is led by Marc Smith, an active self storage investor who has been involved in all facets of the self storage business. Mr. Smith is a past Chairman of the Self Storage Association, and also previously served as president of the Southeast Region of the Self Storage Association.


• | Southern, which is based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, is our PRO responsible for covering portions of the southeast region, including New Orleans, the Florida Panhandle, and southern Georgia, and Puerto Rico. Southern is led by Bob McIntosh and Peter Cowie, who are active real estate operators with more than 30 years of self storage experience. At the beginning of 2019, Southern contributed six of its nine self storage properties to us as part of the initial contribution transaction. As part of its initial contribution, Southern also co-invested sufficient subordinated equity to manage our six properties located in Puerto Rico as well as an additional 11 properties in Louisiana that we acquired in January 2019.

We benefit from the local market knowledge and active presence of our PROs, allowing us to build and foster important customer and industry relationships. These local relationships provide attractive off-market acquisition opportunities that we believe will continue to fuel additional external growth. 
We believe our structure allows our PROs to optimize their established property management platforms while addressing financial and operational hurdles. Before joining us, our PROs faced challenges in securing low cost capital and had to manage multiple investors and lending relationships, making it difficult to compete with larger competitors, including public REITs, for acquisition and investment opportunities. Our PROs were also limited in their ability to raise growth capital through the sale of assets, a portfolio refinancing, or capital contributions from new equity partners. Serving as our on-the-ground acquisition teams, our PROs now have access to our broader financing sources and lower cost of capital, while our national platform allows them to benefit from our economies of scale to drive operating efficiencies in a rapidly evolving, technology-driven industry.

Our Consolidated Properties
We seek to own properties that are well located in high quality sub-markets with highly accessible street access and attractive supply and demand characteristics, providing our properties with strong and stable cash flows that are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value. As of December 31, 2018, we owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 499 self storage properties, located in 26 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 30.4 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 242,000 storage units. Of these properties, 247 were acquired by us from our PROs and 252 were acquired by us from third-party sellers. A complete listing of, and additional information about, our self storage properties is included in Item 2 of this report. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired 57 consolidated self storage properties and an expansion project adjacent to an existing property, of which four were acquired by us from our PROs and 53 were acquired by us from third-party sellers. The following is a summary of our 2018 consolidated acquisition activity (dollars in thousands):

(1) Self storage properties in other states acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 include Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold three self storage properties to unrelated third parties and excess land parcels adjacent to our self storage properties for $17.8 million. The self storage properties comprised approximately 0.2 million rentable square feet configured in approximately 1,200 storage units.
Our Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures
We seek to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios utilizing a promoted return structure. We believe there is significant opportunity for continued external growth by partnering with institutional investors seeking to deploy capital in the self storage industry. 
2018 Joint Venture
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we formed the 2018 Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), in which we have a 25% ownership interest, with an affiliate of Heitman America Real Estate REIT LLC. In September 2018, the 2018 Joint Venture completed the acquisition of a portfolio of 112 self storage properties located across 17 states and Puerto Rico, consisting of approximately 8.2 million rentable square feet configured in over 68,000 storage units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.325 billion (the "Portfolio"). 
Immediately following the closing of the acquisition, the 2018 Joint Venture distributed six self storage properties located in Puerto Rico and a single self storage property located in Ohio acquired as part of the Portfolio to our consolidated portfolio in exchange for a $64.2 million cash contribution from NSA. In addition, two of the properties acquired as part of the Portfolio were combined with other properties for operational efficiency. As of December 31, 2018, our 2018 Joint Venture owned and operated 103 properties containing approximately 7.6 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 63,000 storage units and located across 17 states. 
2016 Joint Venture
As of December 31, 2018, our 2016 Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), in which we have a 25% ownership interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 73 properties containing approximately 4.9 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 40,000 storage units and located across 14 states. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our 2016 Joint Venture acquired three self storage properties and an expansion project at an existing property for $28.5 million, comprising approximately 0.2 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 1,300 storage units. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our 2016 Joint Venture sold to an unrelated third party one self storage property for $9.3 million, comprising approximately 0.2 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 800 storage units.
Our Property Management Platform 
Through our property management platform, we direct, manage and control the day-to-day operations and affairs of certain consolidated properties and our unconsolidated real estate ventures. We earn certain customary fees for managing and operating the properties in the unconsolidated real estate ventures and we facilitate tenant insurance and/or tenant warranty protection programs for tenants at these properties in exchange for half of all proceeds from such programs. 
As of December 31, 2018, our property management platform managed and controlled 39 of our consolidated properties in select markets in California, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia and Puerto Rico. As discussed above, in January 2019, Southern began managing our six properties located in Puerto Rico.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our unique PRO structure combined with our property management platform allows us to differentiate ourselves from other self storage operators, and the following competitive strengths enable us to effectively compete against our industry peers:
High Quality Properties in Key Growth Markets.    We held ownership interests in and operated a geographically diversified portfolio of 675 self storage properties, located in 34 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 43.0 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 345,000 storage units as of December 31, 2018. Over 75% of our consolidated portfolio is located in the top 100 MSAs, based on our 2018 net operating income ("NOI"). We believe that these properties are primarily located in high quality growth markets that have attractive supply and demand characteristics and are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value. Furthermore, we believe that our significant size and the overall geographic diversification of our portfolio reduces risks associated with specific local or regional economic downturns or natural disasters. 
Differentiated, Growth-Oriented Strategy Focused on Established Operators.    We are a self storage REIT with a unique structure that supports our differentiated external growth strategy. Our structure appeals to operators who are looking for access to growth capital while maintaining an economic stake in the self storage properties that each manages on the Company's behalf. These attributes entice operators to join the Company rather than sell their properties for cash consideration. Our strategy is to attract operators who are confident in the future performance of their properties and desire to participate in the growth of the Company. We have successfully recruited established operators across the United States with a history of efficient property management and a track record of successful acquisitions. Our structure and differentiated strategy have enabled us to build a substantial captive pipeline from existing operators as well as potentially create external growth from the recruitment of additional PROs.
Integrated Platform Utilizing Advanced Technology for Enhanced Operational Performance and Best Practices.    Our national platform allows us to capture cost savings through integration and centralization, thereby eliminating redundancies and utilizing economies of scale across the property management platforms of our PROs. As compared to a stand-alone operator, our national platform has greater access to lower-cost capital, reduced Internet marketing costs per customer lead, discounted property insurance expense, and reduced overhead costs. In addition, the Company has sufficient scale for various centralized functions, including financial reporting, the operation of call centers, expanding cell tower leasing, a national credit card processing program, marketing, information technology, legal support, and capital market functions, to achieve substantial cost savings over smaller, individual operators.
Our national platform utilizes advanced technology for our data warehouse program, Internet marketing, our centralized call centers, financial and property analytic dashboards, revenue optimization analytics and expense management tools to enhance operational performance. These centralized programs, which are run through our Technology and Best Practices Group, are positively impacting our business performance, and we believe that they will continue to be a driver of organic growth going forward. We will utilize our Technology and Best Practices Group to help us benefit from the collective sharing of key operating strategies among our PROs in areas like human resource management, local marketing and operating procedures and building tenant insurance-related arrangements.
Aligned Incentive Structure with Shareholder Downside Protection.    Our structure promotes operator accountability as subordinated performance units issued to our PROs in exchange for the contribution of their properties are entitled to distributions only after those properties satisfy minimum performance thresholds. In the event of a material reduction in operating cash flow, distributions on our subordinated performance units will be reduced before or disproportionately to distributions on our common shares held by our common shareholders. In addition, we expect our PROs will generally co-invest subordinated equity in the form of subordinated performance units in each acquisition that they source from a third-party seller, and the value of these subordinated performance units will fluctuate with the performance of their managed portfolios. Therefore, our PROs are incentivized to select acquisitions that are expected to exceed minimum performance thresholds, thereby increasing the value of their subordinated equity stake. We expect that our shareholders will benefit from the higher levels of property performance that our PROs are incentivized to deliver.

Our Business and Growth Strategies
By capitalizing on our competitive strengths, we seek to increase scale, achieve optimal revenue-producing occupancy and rent levels, and increase long-term shareholder value by achieving sustainable long-term growth. Our business and growth strategies to achieve these objectives are as follows:
Maximize Property Level Cash Flow.    We strive to maximize the cash flows at our properties by leveraging the economies of scale provided by our national platform, including through the implementation of new ideas derived from our Technology and Best Practices Group. We believe that our unique PRO structure, centralized infrastructure and efficient national platform will enable us to achieve optimal market rents and occupancy, reduce operating expenses and increase the sale by our PROs of ancillary products and services, including tenant insurance, of which we receive a portion of the proceeds, truck rentals and packing supplies.
Acquire Built-in Captive Pipeline of Target Properties from Existing PROs.    We have an attractive, high quality potential acquisition pipeline (our "captive pipeline") of over 100 self storage properties valued at over $900 million that will continue to drive our future growth. We consider a property to be in our captive pipeline if it (i) is under a management service agreement with one of our PROs, (ii) meets our property quality criteria, and (iii) is either required to be offered to us under the applicable facilities portfolio management agreement or a PRO has a reasonable basis to believe that the controlling owner of the property intends to sell the property in the next seven years.
Our PROs have management service agreements with all of the properties in our captive pipeline and hold controlling and non-controlling ownership interests in some of these properties. With respect to each property in our captive pipeline in which a PRO holds a controlling ownership interest, such PRO has agreed that it will not transfer (or permit the transfer of, to the extent possible) any interest in such self storage property without first offering or causing to be offered (if permissible) such interest to us. In addition, upon maturity of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness encumbering such property, so long as occupancy is consistent with or exceeds average local market levels, which we determine in our sole discretion, such PRO has agreed to offer or cause to be offered (if permissible) such interest to us. With respect to captive pipeline properties in which our PROs have a non-controlling ownership interest or no ownership interest, each PRO has agreed to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to facilitate our purchase of such property. We preserve the discretion to accept or reject any of the properties that our PROs are required to, or elect to, offer (or cause to be offered) to us. 
Access Additional Off-Market Acquisition Opportunities.    Our PROs and their "on-the-ground" personnel have established an extensive network of industry relationships and contacts in their respective markets. Through these local connections, our PROs are able to access acquisition opportunities that are not publicly marketed or sold through auctions. Our structure incentivizes our PROs to source acquisitions in their markets from third-party sellers and consolidate these properties into the Company. Other public self storage companies generally have acquisition teams located at their central offices, which in many instances are far removed from regional and local markets. We believe our operators' networks and close familiarity with the other operators in their markets provide us clear competitive advantages in identifying and selecting attractive acquisition opportunities. Our PROs have sourced 252 acquisitions from third-party sellers comprising approximately 17.0 million rentable square feet as of December 31, 2018.
Recruit Additional New PROs in Target Markets.    We intend to continue to execute on our external growth strategy through additional acquisitions and contributions from future PROs in key markets. We believe there is significant opportunity for growth through consolidation of the highly fragmented composition of the market. We believe that future operators will be attracted to our unique structure, providing them with lower cost of capital, better economies of scale, and greater operational and overhead efficiencies while preserving their existing property management platforms. We intend to add one to three additional PROs to complement our existing geographic footprint and to achieve our goal of creating a highly diversified nationwide portfolio of properties focused in the top 100 MSAs. When considering a PRO candidate, we consider various factors, including the size of the potential PRO's portfolio, the quality and location of its properties, its market exposure, its operating expertise, its ability to grow its business, and its reputation with industry participants. 
Strategic Joint Venture Arrangements.    We intend to continue to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios utilizing a promoted return structure. We believe there is significant opportunity for continued external growth by partnering with institutional investors seeking to deploy capital in the self storage industry. We intend to leverage our property management platform to provide property and asset management services for future strategic joint ventures, generating additional operating profits and third party fee income. 
11

Our Financing Strategy
We expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions. In general, we expect to fund our property acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), property-level debt, issuances of OP equity and public and private equity and debt issuances.
As of December 31, 2018, our unsecured credit facility provided for total borrowings of $1.0 billion, consisting of five components: (i) a revolving line of credit (the "Revolver") which provides for a total borrowing commitment up to $400.0 million, whereby we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolver, (ii) a $235.0 million tranche A term loan facility (the "Term Loan A"), (iii) a $155.0 million tranche B term loan facility (the "Term Loan B"), (iv) a $105.0 million tranche C term loan facility (the "Term Loan C") and (v) a $125.0 million tranche D term loan facility (the "Term Loan D" and together with the Revolver, the Term Loan A, the Term Loan B, and Term Loan C, the "credit facility"). As of December 31, 2018, we had the entire amounts drawn on Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Term Loan C and Term Loan D and we had $139.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolver, and the capacity to borrow an additional $254.8 million under the Revolver while remaining in compliance with the credit facility's financial covenants. As of December 31, 2018, we have an expansion option under the credit facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of $1.3 billion.
We also have a credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders for a term loan facility that matures in June 2023 (the "2023 Term Loan Facility") and is separate from the credit facility in an aggregate amount of $175.0 million, which amount is outstanding. We have an expansion option under the 2023 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total availability in an aggregate amount up to $400.0 million. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement with a lender for a term loan facility that matures in December 2028 (the "2028 Term Loan Facility") and is separate from the credit facility and 2023 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of $75.0 million, which amount is outstanding. We have an expansion option under the 2028 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount up to $125.0 million. 
The credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility and 2028 Term Loan Facility each contain the same financial covenants and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, could limit the Company's ability to make distributions or certain investments, incur debt, incur liens and enter into certain transactions. 
We expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of trustees. Although our board of trustees has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, it will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed and variable-rate, and in making financial decisions, including, among others, the following:

• | the interest rate of the proposed financing;


• | the extent to which the financing impacts our flexibility in managing our properties;


• | prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing;


• | the purchase price of properties we acquire with debt financing;


• | our long-term objectives with respect to the financing;


• | our target investment returns;


• | the ability of particular properties, and the Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;


• | overall level of consolidated indebtedness;


• | timing of debt maturities;

Our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans secured by mortgages or similar liens on our properties, or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties, for general working capital or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
In the future, we may adopt a dividend reinvestment plan that will permit shareholders who elect to participate in the plan to have their cash dividends reinvested in additional common shares.
Regulation
General
Generally, self storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to lien sale rights and procedures, public accommodations, insurance, and the environment. Changes in any of these laws, ordinances or regulations could increase the potential liability existing or created by tenants or others on our properties. Laws, ordinances, or regulations affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("the ADA"), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. For additional information on the ADA, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Costs associated with complying with the ADA may result in unanticipated expenses."
Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto. 
Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the "CERCLA"), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials at one or more of our properties. For additional information on environmental matters and regulation, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations."
Property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.
REIT Qualification
We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code"), commencing with our taxable year ended on December 31, 2015. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income to the extent that we distribute annually all of our net taxable income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we expect that our intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify, and maintain our qualification, as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we still may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or assets. In addition, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, a portion of our business is conducted through, and a portion of our income is earned by, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), which are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax at regular rates. Distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the preferential U.S. federal income tax rates that currently apply to certain distributions received 
13

by individuals from taxable corporations, unless such distributions are attributable to dividends received by us from a TRS. 
Recent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation
On December 22, 2017, Congress enacted H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA"). The TCJA made major changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including the reduction of the tax rates applicable to individuals and subchapter C corporations, a reduction or elimination of certain deductions (including new limitations on the deductibility of interest expense), permitting immediate expensing of capital expenditures and significant changes in the taxation of earnings from non-U.S. sources. The effect of the significant changes made by the TCJA is highly uncertain, and additional administrative guidance is still required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions. Technical corrections or other amendments to the new rules, and additional administrative guidance interpreting these new rules, may be forthcoming at any time but may also be significantly delayed. While we do not currently expect this reform to have a significant impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements, stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the effects of the TCJA or other legislative, regulatory or administrative developments on an investment in the Company's common stock. 
Competition
We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for customers and acquisitions of self storage properties and other assets, including national, regional, and local owners, operators, and developers of self storage properties. We compete based on a number of factors including location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs, and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. We believe that the primary competition for potential customers comes from other self storage properties within a three to five mile radius. We have positioned our properties within their respective markets as high-quality operations that emphasize tenant convenience, security, and professionalism.
We also may compete with numerous other potential buyers when pursuing a possible property for acquisition, which can increase the potential cost of a project. These competing bidders also may possess greater resources than us and therefore be in a better position to acquire a property. However, our use of OP units and subordinated performance units as transactional currency allows us to structure our acquisitions in tax-deferred transactions. As a result, potential targets who are tax-sensitive might favor us as a suitor.
Our primary national competitors in many of our markets for both tenants and acquisition opportunities include local and regional operators, institutional investors, private equity funds, as well as the other public self storage REITs, including Public Storage, Cubesmart, Extra Space Storage Inc. and Life Storage, Inc.  These entities also seek financing through similar channels to the Company. Therefore, we will continue to compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 461 employees, which includes employees of our property management platform but does not include persons employed by our PROs. As of December 31, 2018, our PROs, collectively, had approximately 1,100 full-time and part-time employees involved in management, operations, and reporting with respect to our self storage property portfolio.
