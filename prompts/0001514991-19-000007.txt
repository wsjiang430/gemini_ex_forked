AMC Networks Inc. was incorporated on March 9, 2011 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation (Cablevision Systems Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to as "Cablevision"). On June 30, 2011, Cablevision spun off the Company (the "Distribution"), and AMC Networks Inc. became an independent public company. 
Our Company
AMC Networks is a global entertainment company that operates several of the most recognized brands in television, creating and presenting high quality content and compelling stories to audiences, and a valuable platform for distributors and advertisers. We have operated in the cable programming industry for more than 30 years, and, over this time, we have continually enhanced the value of our network portfolio. Our content spans multiple genres, including drama, comedy, documentary, reality, anthology, feature film and short form. Our programming networks are well known and well regarded by our key constituents — our viewers, distributors and advertisers — and have developed strong followings within their respective targeted demographics, increasing their value to distributors and advertisers.
In the United States ("U.S."), our programming networks are AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA (operated through a joint venture with the commercial arm of the BBC, IFC and SundanceTV. Each of our programming networks has established itself within its respective markets. Our deep and established presence in the industry and the recognition we have received for our brands through industry awards and other honors lend us a high degree of credibility with distributors and content producers, and help provide us with stable affiliate and studio relationships, advantageous channel placements, heightened viewer engagement and demand for our owned programming for distribution on platforms other than our own. Our networks are also distributed through virtual multi-channel video programming distributors. We either own or license the content we distribute. Through our AMC Studios operation, we are increasing the amount of our owned original programming. Our ability to produce owned high quality content has provided us with the opportunity to distribute such content on platforms other than our domestic networks. Our owned and licensed content is distributed domestically and internationally and on multiple platforms, including linear television, digital services, home video and syndication.
AMC Networks also operates IFC Films, a film distribution business that distributes independent narrative and documentary films under the IFC Films label as well as the Sundance Selects and IFC Midnight distribution labels. IFC Films is known for attracting high-profile talent and distributing films that regularly garner critical acclaim and industry honors, including numerous Oscar- Golden Globe-, and Cannes Film Festival-award winning titles.
Internationally, we deliver programming that reaches subscribers in more than 130 countries and territories around the world. The international division of the Company, AMC Networks International ("AMCNI"), consists of global brands, including AMC and SundanceTV, in the movie and entertainment programming genres, as well as popular, locally recognized channels in several other programming genres.
We also operate and own two subscription streaming services, Sundance Now, launched in 2014, and Shudder, launched in 2015. These services are available in the United States, Canada and parts of Europe. Sundance Now features independent film, TV shows, documentaries, and original series. Shudder is dedicated to films in the horror, suspense and thriller genres. We primarily license content for these services.

During 2018, we acquired controlling interests in RLJ Entertainment, Inc. ("RLJE"), a content distribution company that also includes the subscription streaming services Acorn TV and Urban Movie Channel ("UMC"); and Levity Entertainment Group LLC ("Levity"), a production services and comedy venues company.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to maintain and improve our position as a leading entertainment company by creating and presenting content that is high-quality, brand defining and compelling to watch, and by owning and operating some of the most popular and award-winning brands in television that create engagement with audiences globally across multiple distribution platforms. The key focuses of our strategy are:
Continued Development of High-Quality Original Programming. We intend to continue developing strong original programming across all of our programming networks to further enhance our brands, strengthen our relationships with our viewers, distributors and advertisers, and increase distribution and audience ratings. We intend to continue to seek increased distribution of our national networks to grow distribution and advertising revenues. We believe that our continued investment in original programming supports future growth in distribution and advertising revenue. We also intend to continue to expand the exploitation of our original programming across multiple distribution platforms.
Increased Control of Content. We believe that control (including long-term contractual arrangements) and ownership of content is important. Through our AMC Studios operation, we intend to increase our control position over our programming content. We currently control, own or have long-term license agreements covering significant portions of our content across our programming networks, RLJE and our independent film distribution business operated by IFC Films. We intend to continue to focus on obtaining the broadest possible control rights (both as to territory and platforms) for our content.
Exploitation of Other Media Platforms. The technological landscape of the distribution of entertainment content has expanded to include other media platforms. We distribute our content across many of these platforms, when it makes business sense to do so, so that our viewers can access our content where, when and how they want it. To that end, our programming networks are allowing many of our distributors to offer our content to subscribers on computers and other digital devices, and on video on demand platforms, all of which permit subscribers to access programs at their convenience. We also make certain of our content available on subscription video on demand (SVOD) services or digital platform providers, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, electronic-sell-through (EST) and physical (DVD and Blu-ray) formats, as well as our subscription streaming services, Sundance Now, Shudder, Acorn TV and UMC.
Growth of Advertising Revenue. We continue to evolve the programming on each of our networks to achieve even stronger viewer engagement within their respective core targeted demographics, thereby increasing the value of our programming to advertisers and allowing us to obtain higher advertising rates. We are continuing to seek additional advertising revenue through higher Nielsen ratings in desirable demographics.
Increased Global Distribution. We distribute our programming networks around the globe. We first expanded beyond the U.S. market with the launch in Canada of IFC (in 2001) and AMC (in 2006), and SundanceTV in Europe (in 2010). In 2014, AMC was launched internationally and is now available in more than 110 countries. Additionally, SundanceTV has expanded its distribution to over 70 countries. One or more of AMC Networks International's channels are available in more than 130 countries and territories worldwide.
Revenue
We earn revenue principally from the distribution of our programming and the sale of advertising. Distribution revenues primarily include fees paid by distributors to carry our programming networks as well as revenue earned from the licensing of original programming for digital, international and home video distribution. In 2018, distribution revenues and advertising sales accounted for 65% and 35% of our consolidated revenues, net, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer in our National Networks segment, AT&T Inc., accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues, net.
Distribution Revenue
Subscription revenue: Our programming networks are distributed to our viewing audience throughout the U.S. and around the world via cable and other multichannel video programming distribution platforms, including direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), platforms operated by telecommunications providers and virtual multichannel video programming distributors (collectively "distributors") pursuant to agreements with the distributors. Our subscription fee revenues are based on a per subscriber fee, and, to a lesser extent, fixed fees under multi-year contracts, commonly referred to as "affiliation agreements," which generally provide for annual rate increases. The specific subscription fee revenues we earn vary from period to period, distributor to distributor and also vary among our networks, but are generally based upon the number of each distributor's subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers. These agreements also give us the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programming networks. Our programming networks' existing distribution agreements expire at various dates through 2026.
6

We frequently negotiate with distributors in an effort to increase the subscriber base for our networks. We have in some instances made upfront payments to distributors in exchange for these additional subscribers. We also may help fund the distributors' efforts to market our programming networks or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by such deferred carriage fee arrangements, discounted subscriber fees and other payments, however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period.
Content licensing revenue: We sell rights to our owned original programming and content acquired under long-term distribution arrangements for distribution in a variety of forms including television markets worldwide, SVOD services or digital platform providers, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, electronic-sell-through (EST) and physical (DVD and Blu-ray) formats.
Advertising Revenue
We earn advertising revenue by selling advertising time on our programming networks. In the U.S., we sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season, and by purchasing in advance, often receive discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run, and often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. Internationally, advertising markets vary by jurisdiction. The majority of international advertising is sold close to the time when the commercials will be run (similar to the U.S. scatter market) and are generally represented by third-party sales agents.
Our arrangements with advertisers provide for a set number of advertising units to air over a specific period of time at a negotiated price per unit. In most domestic advertising sales arrangements, our programming networks guarantee specified viewer ratings for their programming. If these guaranteed viewer ratings are not met, we are generally required to provide additional advertising units to the advertiser at no charge. For these types of arrangements, a portion of the related revenue is deferred if the guaranteed viewer ratings are not met and is subsequently recognized either when we provide the required additional advertising unit or the guarantee obligation contractually expires. In the U.S., most of our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. In addition to the Nielsen rating, our advertising rates are also influenced by the demographic mix of our viewing audiences, since advertisers tend to pay premium rates for more desirable demographic groups of viewers.
Our programming networks have advertisers representing companies in a broad range of sectors, including automotive, restaurants/food, health, and telecommunications industries. 
Programming
We obtain programming through a combination of development, production and licensing; and we distribute programming directly to consumers in the U.S. and throughout the world through our programming networks, digital and other forms of distribution and theatrical release of our IFC Films acquired content. Our programming includes original programming that we control, either through outright ownership or through long-term licensing arrangements, as well as acquired programming that we license from studios and other rights holders. Since our founding in 1980, we have been a pioneer in the cable television programming industry, having created or developed some of the industry's leading programming networks, with a focus on programming of film and original productions. Certain of our programming networks feature original programming that includes critically-acclaimed original scripted dramatic series. 
Original Programming
We contract with some of the industry's leading production companies to produce most of the original programming that appears on our programming networks. These contractual arrangements either provide us with outright ownership of the programming, in which case we hold all programming and other rights to the content, or they consist of long-term licensing arrangements, which provide us with exclusive rights to exhibit the content on our programming networks, but may be limited in terms of specific geographic markets or distribution platforms. The license agreements are typically of multi-season duration and provide us with a right of first negotiation or a right of first refusal on the renewal of the license for additional programming seasons. 
We also increasingly produce original programming through our AMC Studios operation, primarily for our programming networks and also for license to third-parties worldwide. Decisions as to how to distribute programming are made on the basis of a variety of factors including the relative value of any particular alternative. 
Acquired Programming
The majority of the content on our programming networks consists of films, episodic series and specials that we acquire pursuant to rights agreements with film studios, production companies or other rights holders. This acquired programming includes episodic series such as Law and Order, The X-Files, Criminal Minds, CSI: Miami, Two and a Half Men and Batman, as well as 
7

an extensive film library. The rights agreements for this content are of varying duration and generally permit our programming networks to carry these series, films and other programming during certain window periods.
Segments
We manage our business through the following two operating segments:

• | National Networks: Includes activities of our five national programming networks, AMC Studios operations and AMC Broadcasting & Technology. Our national programming networks are AMC, WE tv, BBC AMERICA, IFC, and SundanceTV in the U.S.; and AMC and IFC in Canada. Our AMC Studios operations produce original programming for our programming networks and also license such program rights worldwide. AMC Networks Broadcasting & Technology is our technical services business, which primarily services most of the national programming networks.


• | International and Other: Principally includes AMCNI, the Company's international programming businesses consisting of a portfolio of channels in over 130 countries and territories around the world; IFC Films, the Company's independent film distribution business; Levity, acquired April 20, 2018, our production services and comedy venues company; RLJE, acquired October 1, 2018, a content distribution company that also includes the subscription streaming services Acorn TV and UMC, and our wholly-owned subscription streaming services, Shudder and Sundance Now.

AMC is home to some of the most popular and acclaimed programs on television. The network's series The Walking Dead is the highest-rated series in cable television history.

Both series are among the most critically acclaimed and awarded series in the history of television. AMC became the first basic cable network to win the Emmy® Award for Outstanding Drama Series with Mad Men in 2008, which then went on to win four years in a row before Breaking Bad followed shortly thereafter by winning in 2013 and 2014.

Regulation
Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. The Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") regulates U.S. programming networks directly in some respects; other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and satellite operators, affect programming networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. The descriptions below are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
Closed Captioning
Certain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, and we must provide closed captioning on certain video content that we offer on the Internet or through other Internet Protocol distribution methods.
CALM Act
FCC rules require multichannel video programming distributors to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and our distribution agreements generally require us to certify compliance with such standards.
Obscenity Restrictions
Cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks.
Packaging Programming and Volume Discounts
The FCC from time to time examines whether to adopt rules restricting how programmers package and price their networks, or whether to impose other restrictions on carriage agreements between programmers and multichannel video programming distributors. We do not currently require distributors to carry more than one of our national programming networks in order to obtain the right to carry a particular national programming network. However, we generally negotiate with a distributor for the carriage of all of our national networks concurrently, and we offer volume discounts to distributors who make our programming available to larger numbers of subscribers or who carry more of our programming networks.
Effect of "Must-Carry" and "Retransmission Consent" Requirements
The FCC's implementation of the statutory "must-carry" obligations requires cable and DBS operators to give certain broadcasters preferential access to channel space, and FCC "retransmission consent" rules allow broadcasters to require cable and DBS operators to carry broadcast-affiliated networks as a condition of access to the local broadcast station and to charge substantial fees for both carriage of the local broadcast station and the broadcast-affiliated networks. In contrast, programming networks, such as ours, have no guaranteed right of carriage on cable television or DBS systems. These carriage laws may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable television systems and DBS operators, or the amount of programming funds that cable and DBS operators have available for carriage of our networks.

Website Requirements
We maintain various websites that provide information regarding our businesses and offer content for sale. The operation of these websites may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy, data security, accessibility, child safety and consumer protection regulations.
Other Regulation
The FCC also imposes rules that may impact us regarding a variety of issues such as political broadcasts, sponsorship identification, advertising in children's television, and telemarketing. Programming businesses are subject to regulation by the country in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. These regulations may include restrictions on types of advertising that can be sold on our networks, programming content requirements, requirements to make programming available on non-discriminatory terms, and local content quotas.
Competition
Our programming networks operate in three highly competitive markets. First, our programming networks compete with other programming networks and other types of programming services to obtain distribution on cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distribution systems, and ultimately for viewing by each distributor's subscribers. Second, our programming networks compete with other programming networks and other sources of video content, to secure desired entertainment programming. Third, our programming networks compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other cable programming networks, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and, increasingly, internet sites. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to license and produce content for our programming networks that is adequate in quantity and quality and will generate satisfactory viewer ratings. In each of these cases, some of our competitors are large publicly held companies that have greater financial resources than we do. In addition, we compete with these entities for advertising revenue.
Distribution of Programming Networks
The business of distributing programming networks to cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distributors and licensing of original programming for distribution is highly competitive. Our programming networks face competition from other programming networks for carriage by a particular multichannel video programming distributor, and for the carriage on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once our programming network is selected by a distributor for carriage, that network competes for viewers not only with the other programming networks available on the distributor's system, but also with over-the-air broadcast television, Internet-based video and other online services, mobile services, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, DVDs, and other sources of information and entertainment.
Important to our success in each area of competition we face are the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality and variety of the programming offered on our networks, and the effectiveness of our networks' marketing efforts. The competition for viewers among advertiser supported networks is directly correlated with the competition for advertising revenues with each of our competitors.
Our ability to successfully compete with other networks may be hampered because the cable television systems or other multichannel video programming distributors through which we seek distribution may be affiliated with other programming networks. In addition, because such distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such programming networks to obtain distribution on the systems of affiliated distributors may lead to increased distribution and advertising revenue for such programming networks because of their increased penetration compared to our programming networks. Even if such affiliated distributors carry our programming networks, such distributors may place their affiliated programming network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own.
New or existing programming networks that are affiliated with broadcasting networks like ABC, CBS, Fox or NBC may also have a competitive advantage over our programming networks in obtaining distribution through the "bundling" of agreements to carry those programming networks with agreements giving the distributor the right to carry a broadcast station affiliated with the broadcasting network. 
Part of our strategy involves exploiting identified segments of the cable television viewing audience that are generally well defined and limited in size. Our networks have faced and will continue to face increasing competition as other programming networks and online or other services seek to serve the same or similar niches.
We also seek to increase our content licensing revenues by expanding the opportunities for licensing our programming through other media platforms and we compete with other programming companies in this market based on the desirability of our programming.
Sources of Programming
We also compete with other programming networks and other distributors including digital distribution platforms to secure desired programming. Most of our original programming and all of our acquired programming is obtained through agreements

with other parties that have produced or own the rights to such programming. Competition for this programming will increase as the number of programming networks and other distributors increases. Other programming networks that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area.
With respect to the acquisition of entertainment programming, such as syndicated programs and movies that are not produced by or specifically for networks, our competitors include national broadcast television networks, local broadcast television stations, other cable programming networks, Internet-based video content distributors, and video-on-demand programs. Some of these competitors have exclusive contracts with motion picture studios or independent motion picture distributors or own film libraries.
Competition for Advertising Revenue
Our programming networks must compete with other sellers of advertising time and space, including other multichannel video programming distributors, radio, newspapers, outdoor media and increasing shifts in spending toward online and mobile offerings from more traditional media. We compete for advertisers on the basis of rates we charge and also on the number and demographic nature of viewers who watch our programming. Advertisers will often seek to target their advertising content to those demographic categories they consider most likely to purchase the product or service they advertise. Accordingly, the demographic make-up of our viewership can be equally or more important than the number of viewers watching our programming.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018 we had 2,234 full-time employees and 980 part-time employees. In addition, for certain of our productions, the Company, through in-house and third party production service companies, engages the services of writers, directors, actors and various crew members who are subject to certain specially negotiated collective bargaining agreements.  Since these agreements are generally entered into on a per-project basis, negotiations occur on various agreements throughout the year.  We believe that our relations with the labor unions and our employees are generally good.
