BUSINESS STRATEGIES
The following is a discussion of the Company’s business strategies in regards to real estate investment and management.
Business Strategies
Research Driven Approach to Investments – The Company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge. The Company continually assesses markets where the Company operates, as well as markets where the Company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating markets and focusing on the following strategic criteria:

• | Major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million;


• | Constraints on new supply driven by: (i) low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built; (ii) political growth barriers, such as protected land, urban growth boundaries, and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes; and (iii) natural limitations to development, such as mountains or waterways;


• | Rental demand enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of for-sale housing; and


• | Housing demand based on job growth, proximity to jobs, high median incomes and the quality of life including related commuting factors.

Recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic, and local market research, and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly. The Company seeks to increase its portfolio

allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields.
Property Operations – The Company manages its communities by focusing on activities that may generate above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and long-term asset appreciation.  The Company intends to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below:

• | Property Management – Oversee delivery of and quality of the housing provided to our tenants and manage the properties financial performance.


• | Capital Preservation – The Company's asset management services are responsible for the planning, budgeting and completion of major capital improvement projects at the Company’s communities.


• | Business Planning and Control – Comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with significant investment decisions. These plans include benchmarks for future financial performance based on collaborative discussions between on-site managers and senior management.


• | Development and Redevelopment – The Company focuses on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply constrained markets, and redeveloping its existing communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of the Company’s communities.

CURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Acquisitions of Real Estate
Acquisitions are an important component of the Company’s business plan, and during 2018, the Company acquired ownership interests in two communities comprised of 384 apartment homes for $139.4 million.  
The following is a summary of 2018 acquisitions ($ in millions):


Property Name | Location | Apartment Homes | Essex Ownership Percentage | | Ownership | Quarter in 2018 | Purchase Price | 
Meridian at Midtown | San Jose, CA | 218 | | 50 | % | Wesco V | Q4 | | 104.0 | (1)
Marquis(2) | San Jose, CA | 166 | | 100 | % | EPLP | Q4 | | 35.4 | 
Total 2018 | 384 | | | | | | $ | 139.4 | 


(1) | Meridian at Midtown contract price represents the total contract price at 100%.


(2) | In December 2018, the Company purchased the joint venture partner's 49.9% membership interest in the Marquis co-investment. As part of the acquisition, the Company paid $4.7 million in cash and issued Operating Partnership units for the remaining equity based on an estimated gross property valuation of $71.0 million and an encumbrance of $45.8 million of mortgage debt.

Dispositions of Real Estate
As part of its strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets, the Company continually evaluates all of its communities and sells those which no longer meet its strategic criteria. The Company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higher-return communities or other real estate investments, or to repay debts. The Company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on its future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect its ongoing operations. Generally, the Company seeks to have any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions offset by the positive impact of its acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities.
In June 2018, the Company sold Domain, a 379 apartment home community located in San Diego, CA for $132.0 million, resulting in a gain of $22.3 million for the Company.
In November 2018, a Company co-investment, BEXAEW, LLC ("BEXAEW") sold Enclave at Town Square, a 124 apartment home community located in Chino Hills, CA, for $30.5 million, resulting in a gain of $5.4 million for the Company.

In November 2018, a Company co-investment, Wesco III, LLC ("Wesco III") sold The Summit, a 125 apartment home community located in Chino Hills, CA, for $34.8 million, resulting in a gain of $5.2 million for the Company.
In December 2018, the Company sold 8th & Hope, a 290 apartment home community located in Los Angeles, CA for $220.0 million, resulting in a gain of $39.6 million for the Company.
Development Pipeline
The Company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed, or are newly constructed and are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's development pipeline was comprised of four consolidated projects under development and two joint venture projects under development aggregating 1,861 apartment homes, with total incurred costs of $812.0 million, and estimated remaining project costs of approximately $417.0 million, $310.0 million of which represents the Company's estimated remaining costs, for total estimated project costs of $1.2 billion. 
The Company defines predevelopment projects as proposed communities in negotiation or in the entitlement process with an expected high likelihood of becoming entitled development projects. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had various consolidated predevelopment projects. The Company may also acquire land for future development purposes or sale.

Redevelopment Pipeline
The Company defines the redevelopment pipeline as existing properties owned or recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment by the Company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement.  During redevelopment, apartment homes may not be available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company had ownership interests in five major redevelopment communities aggregating 1,727 apartment homes with estimated redevelopment costs of $140.1 million, of which approximately $27.8 million remains to be expended.
Long Term Debt
During 2018, the Company made regularly scheduled principal payments and loan payoffs of $297.5 million of its secured mortgage notes payable at an average interest rate of 5.1%.
In March 2018, the Company issued $300.0 million of 30-year 4.500% senior unsecured notes that mature on March 15, 2048. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing September 15, 2018, until the maturity date on March 15, 2048. The Company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness under its unsecured credit facilities and for other general corporate and working capital purposes.
Bank Debt
As of December 31, 2018, Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investor Service, and Standard and Poor's ("S&P") credit agencies rated Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio, L.P. BBB+/Positive, Baa1/Stable, and BBB+/Stable, respectively.
At December 31, 2018, the Company had two lines of unsecured credit aggregating $1.24 billion. The Company's $1.2 billion credit facility had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%, with a scheduled maturity date in December 2021 with one 18-month extension, exercisable at the Company's option. In January 2019, the line of credit facility was amended such that the scheduled maturity date was extended to December 2022 with one 18-month extension, exercisable at the Company's option. The interest rate on the amended line is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's corporate ratings and is currently at LIBOR plus 0.825%. The Company's $35.0 million working capital unsecured line of credit had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%, with a scheduled maturity date in January 2020. 
Equity Transactions
In September 2018, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $900.0 million (the "2018 ATM Program"). In connection with the 2018 ATM Program, the Company may also enter into forward sale agreements whereby, at the Company’s discretion, it may sell shares of its common stock under the 2018 ATM Program under forward sales agreements. The use of a forward sales agreement would allow the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of its common stock at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date.
Upon entering into the 2018 ATM Program, the Company simultaneously terminated its existing equity distribution agreements, which were entered into in March 2016 in connection with its prior at-the-market equity offering program (the "2016 ATM Program"). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not sell any shares of its common stock through the 2018 ATM Program or through the 2016 ATM Program. Since commencement of the 2018 ATM Program, as of December 31, 2018, the Company has not sold any shares of its common stock and there are no outstanding forward sale agreements, and $900.0 million of shares remains available to be sold under the 2018 ATM Program.
Co-investments
The Company has entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures or partnerships (including limited liability companies) through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100% of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership. For each joint venture the Company holds a non-controlling interest in the venture and earns customary management fees and may earn development fees, asset property management fees, and a promote interest.
The Company has also made, and may continue in the future to make, preferred equity investments in various multifamily development projects. The Company earns a preferred rate of return on these investments.

OFFICES AND EMPLOYEES
The Company is headquartered in San Mateo, CA, and has regional offices in Woodland Hills, CA; Irvine, CA; San Diego, CA and Bellevue, WA. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,826 employees.
INSURANCE 
The Company purchases general liability and property insurance coverage, including loss of rent, for each of its communities. The Company also purchases limited earthquake, terrorism, environmental and flood insurance. There are certain types of losses which may not be covered or could exceed coverage limits. The insurance programs are subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions in varying amounts. The Company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Pacific Western Insurance LLC ("PWI") to self-insure certain earthquake and property losses. As of December 31, 2018, PWI had cash and marketable securities of approximately $86.6 million, and is consolidated in the Company's financial statements.
All of the Company's communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. The Company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and in most cases property vulnerability analysis based on structural evaluations by seismic consultants. The Company manages this exposure, where considered appropriate, desirable, and cost-effective, by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events, by considering available funds and coverages provided by PWI and/or by purchasing seismic insurance. In most cases the Company also purchases limited earthquake insurance for certain properties owned by the Company's co-investments. 
In addition, the Company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures. 
Based on market conditions, the Company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages, or increase levels of self-insurance. Further, the Company may incur losses, which could be material, due to uninsured risks, deductibles and self-insured retentions, and/or losses in excess of coverage limits.
COMPETITION
There are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the Company’s communities in attracting tenants. These include other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family homes. If the demand for the Company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing housing, rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
The Company faces competition from other REITs, businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities. Some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. This competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the Company acquires and/or develops.
WORKING CAPITAL
The Company believes that cash flows generated by its operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2019.
The timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates, stock price, and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect the Company’s plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
See the discussion under the caption, "Risks Related to Real Estate Investments and Our Operations - The Company’s Portfolio may have environmental liabilities" in Item 1A, Risk Factors, for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on its operations, which discussion under the caption "The Company’s Portfolio may have environmental liabilities" is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.

OTHER MATTERS
Certain Policies of the Company
The Company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its common stock, (ii) fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and (iii) offer shares of common stock and/or units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate.
The Company invests primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within Southern California, Northern California, and the Seattle metropolitan area. The Company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions. However, these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management.
