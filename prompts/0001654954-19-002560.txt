  Item 1. Business
   
  Overview
 
 We are leveraging experience with pre-clinical enhanced ultrasound devices to develop technology for increasing the capabilities of clinical diagnostic ultrasound, to broaden patient access to the safe diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical conditions in circumstances where expensive X-ray computed tomography (“CT”) and magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) technology is unavailable or impractical.
 
 In 2010, we began marketing and selling our Nexus 128 system, which combined light-based thermoacoustics and ultrasound to address the imaging needs of researchers studying disease models in pre-clinical applications. Building on this expertise in thermoacoustics, we have developed a next-generation technology platform — Thermo Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound, or TAEUS — which is intended to enhance the capability of clinical ultrasound technology and support the diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical conditions that currently require the use of expensive CT or MRI imaging or where imaging is not practical using existing technology. We ceased production of our Nexus 128 system as of January 1, 2019 and plan to stop providing service support and parts for all existing Nexus 128 systems as of July 1, 2019 in order to focus our resources on the development of our TAEUS technology.
 
 Unlike the near-infrared light pulses used in our legacy Nexus 128 system, our TAEUS technology uses radio frequency (“RF”) pulses to stimulate tissues, using a small fraction (less than 1%) of the energy that would be transmitted into the body during an MRI scan. The use of RF energy allows our TAEUS technology to penetrate deep into tissue, enabling the imaging of human anatomy at depths equivalent to those of conventional ultrasound. The RF pulses are absorbed by tissue and converted into ultrasound signals, which are detected by an external ultrasound receiver and a digital acquisition system that is part of the TAEUS system. The detected ultrasound is processed into images using our proprietary algorithms and displayed to complement conventional gray-scale ultrasound images.
 
 As described below, our first TAEUS platform application will focus on quantifying fat in the liver and stage progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) which, untreated, can progress to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis, or NASH, cirrhosis and liver cancer. In April 2016, we entered into a Collaborative Research Agreement with General Electric Company, acting through its GE Healthcare business unit and the GE Global Research Center (collectively, “GE Healthcare”), under which GE Healthcare has agreed to assist us in our efforts to commercialize this application. In November 2017, we contracted with the Centre for Imaging Technology Commercialization (“CIMTEC”) to initiate human studies, through Canada-based Robarts Research Institute, with our TAEUS device targeting NAFLD. In October 2018, we received an Investigational Testing Authorization (“ITA”) from Health Canada to commence the first human studies in healthy volunteers with our TAEUS clinical system targeting NAFLD, guiding our algorithm development, and comparing our technology to MRI. The feasibility study, the first of several planned human studies, is being conducted in collaboration with the widely respected Robarts Research Institute in London, Canada. We expect to receive study results in the first quarter of 2019. The data collected from the study, including additional usability inputs, will be included in our TAEUS liver device technical file submission for device CE Mark, which we anticipate in mid-2019.
 
 Each of our TAEUS platform applications will require regulatory approvals before we are able to sell or license the application. Based on certain factors, such as the installed base of ultrasound systems, availability of other imaging technologies, such as CT and MRI, economic strength and applicable regulatory requirements, we intend to seek initial approval of our applications for sale in the European Union, followed by the United States and China.

  Diagnostic Imaging Technologies
  
 Diagnostic imaging technologies such as CT, MRI and ultrasound allow physicians to look inside a person’s body to guide treatment or gather information about medical conditions such as broken bones, cancers, signs of heart disease or internal bleeding. The type of imaging technology a physician uses depends on a patient’s symptoms and the part of the body being examined. CT technology is well suited for viewing bone injuries, diagnosing lung and chest problems, and detecting cancers. MRI technology excels at examining soft tissue in ligament and tendon injuries, spinal cord injuries, and brain tumors. CT scans can take as little as 5 minutes, while an MRI scan can take up to 30 minutes.
  
 Unfortunately, while CT and MRI systems are versatile and create high quality images, they are also expensive and not always accessible to patients. A CT system costs approximately $1 million and an MRI system can cost up to $3 million. CT and MRI systems are large and can weigh several tons, typically requiring significant modifications to existing healthcare facilities to safely handle the load. Because of their size and weight, CT and MRI systems are usually fixed-in-place at major medical facilities. As a result, they are less accessible to primary care and rural clinics, economically developing markets, and patient bedsides. As of 2013, there were only approximately 64,000 CT systems and 32,000 MRI systems in the world, approximately 50% of which were located in the U.S. and Japan.
  
 While CT and MRI systems create high quality images, their use is not always practical. For example, the diagnosis and treatment of the estimated 1.4 billion patients suffering from NAFLD, requires ongoing surveillance of the patients’ livers to assess the progression of the disease and the efficacy of treatment. However, the use of CT and MRI systems to perform that surveillance is impractical for a number of reasons, including the high cost of the scan, the limited availability of CT and MRI systems and the required use of contrast agents, including those containing radioactive substances that can cause allergic reactions and reduced kidney functions. Patient exposure to the ionizing radiation generated by a CT system must be limited for safety reasons. Similarly, because of the strong magnetic field created by an MRI machine, patients with metal joint replacements or cardiac pacemakers cannot be imaged with an MRI system.
  
 Because of CT and MRI’s limited availability and practical limitations, a patient who would otherwise be a candidate for CT or MRI scanning must often rely on less effective or less practical methods. For example, MRI scans are not typically used to measure tissue temperature during thermoablative (temperature based) surgery. Instead, physicians use printed manufacturer guidelines to time the thermal surgery or insert surgical temperature probes in an attempt to guide treatment. As a result, the treatment is often imprecise or comes with additional risks, such as infection.
  
 These limitations have led to a decrease in the number of CT scans. According to the American College of Radiology, the overall number of CT scans performed in the United States under Medicare Part B fell approximately 8% from 2009 to 2014. The decline in CT scans has been accompanied by increased use of alternative scanning technologies. The American College of Radiology reported that the overall number of ultrasound scans performed in the United States under Medicare Part B increased approximately 6% from 2009 to 2014. During the same period MRI usage increased by 5%, but remains significantly below the use of ultrasound technology, even in the United States.
  
  Ultrasound Technology
  
 An ultrasound machine transmits sound waves, which bounce off tissues, organs and blood in the body. The ultrasound machine captures these echoes and uses them to create an image. Ultrasound technology excels at imaging the structure of internal organs, muscles and bone surfaces. Due to its utility, cost-effectiveness and safety profile, ultrasound imaging is frequently used in a physician’s examination room or at a patient’s bedside as a first-line diagnostic tool, which has resulted in an overall increase in the number of ultrasound scans performed.
  
 Ultrasound systems are more broadly available to patients than either CT or MRI systems. There are an estimated 925,000 ultrasound systems globally in use today. Ultrasound systems are relatively inexpensive compared to CT and MRI systems, with smaller portable ultrasound systems costing as little as $10,000 and new cart-based ultrasound systems costing between $75,000 and $200,000. Ultrasound systems are also more mobile than CT and MRI systems and many are designed to be moved by an operator from room to room, or closer to patients. Ultrasound technology does not present the same safety concerns as CT and MRI technology, since ultrasound does not emit ionizing radiation and ultrasound contrast agents are considered to be generally safe.
  
 However, ultrasound’s imaging capabilities are more limited compared to CT and MRI technology. For example, ultrasound systems cannot measure tissue temperature during thermal ablation surgery, or quantify fat to diagnose early stage liver disease -- instances where CT and MRI systems are used.

  Ultrasound Market
  
 Sales of ultrasound diagnostic equipment were approximately $4.4 billion globally in 2017 and are expected to grow at approximately 4.4% annually. There are an estimated 925,000 installed systems generating over 400 million annual diagnostic ultrasound procedures globally. Additionally, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 new and replacement systems are sold into the market each year. These numbers include both portable and cart-based ultrasound systems, and cover all types of diagnostic ultrasound procedures, including systems intended for cardiology, prenatal and abdominal use. We do not intend to address low-cost, portable ultrasound systems and systems focused on applications, such as prenatal care, where we believe our TAEUS technology will not substantially impact patient care. Accordingly, we define our addressable market for one or more of our TAEUS applications at approximately 338,000 cart-based ultrasound systems currently in use throughout the world.
  
 We believe that demand for ultrasound systems is driven primarily by the following factors:
  
  ●
Population growth and age demographics that increase the demand for diagnostic screening for cancer, cardiology, and prenatal applications.

 
  ●
Economic development broadening investment in healthcare in underserved markets such as China and Latin America, where ultrasound technology has significant appeal due to its price point and flexibility at point-of-care.

 
  ●
Expanding ultrasound applications and improving image quality that drive demand for new ultrasound technologies, such as software enhancements, bi-axial probes, and dedicated single application systems.

 
  ●
Positive insurance reimbursement rate trends for ultrasound diagnostics due to the technology’s safety and cost-effectiveness.

  
  Unmet Need
  
 We believe that the limited availability of high-utility and cost-effective imaging technology represents a significant unmet medical need. We believe that expanding the capability of ultrasound technology to perform more of the imaging tasks presently available only on expensive CT and MRI systems will satisfy this unmet need.
 Our Solutions
  
 Our Thermo-Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound, or TAEUS, technology uses a pulsed energy source – near-infrared light and radio-frequency, or RF, respectively – to generate ultrasonic waves in tissue. These waves are then detected with ultrasound equipment and used to create high-contrast images using our proprietary algorithms. Unlike conventional ultrasound, which creates images based on the scattering properties of tissue, thermoacoustic imaging provides tissue absorption maps of the pulsed energy, similar to those generated by CT scans. Ultrasound is only utilized to transmit the absorption signal to the imaging system outside of the body.
Our TAEUS Technology Platform for Clinical Applications
  
 To increase the utility of our thermoacoustic technology, in 2013 we began to develop our TAEUS technology platform. Unlike the near-infrared light pulses used in our earlier ultrasound systems, our TAEUS technology uses RF pulses to stimulate tissues, using a small fraction of the energy transmitted into the body during an MRI scan. Using RF energy enables our TAEUS technology to penetrate deep into tissue, enabling the imaging of human anatomy at depths equivalent to those of conventional ultrasound. The RF pulses are absorbed by tissue and converted into ultrasound signals, which are detected by an external ultrasound receiver and a digital acquisition system that is part of the TAEUS system. The detected ultrasound is processed into images using our proprietary algorithms and displayed to complement conventional gray-scale ultrasound images. The TAEUS imaging process is illustrated below:
  
 Our RF-based thermoacoustics imaging is not adversely affected by blood-filled organs, enabling our TAEUS technology to be used in clinical liver applications, among others.
  
 After approval, our TAEUS technology can be added as an accessory to existing ultrasound systems, helping to improve clinical decision-making on the front lines of patient care, without requiring new clinical workflows or large capital investments. We are also developing TAEUS for incorporation into new ultrasound systems, primarily through our collaboration with GE Healthcare, described more fully below.

 We believe that our TAEUS technology has the potential to add a number of new capabilities to conventional ultrasound and thereby enhance the utility of both existing and new ultrasound systems and extend the use of ultrasound technology to circumstances that either require the use of expensive CT or MRI imaging systems or where imaging is not practical using existing technology. To demonstrate the capabilities of our TAEUS platform, we have conducted various internal ex-vivo laboratory experiments and limited internal in-vivo large animal studies. In our ex-vivo and in-vivo testing, we have demonstrated that the TAEUS platform has the following capabilities and potential clinical applications:
   
  ●
Tissue Composition: Our TAEUS technology enables ultrasound to distinguish fat from lean tissue. This capability would enable the use of TAEUS-enhanced ultrasound for the early identification, staging and monitoring of NAFLD, a precursor to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver cancer.

  
  ●
Temperature Monitoring: Our TAEUS technology enables traditional ultrasound to visualize changes in tissue temperature, in real time. This capability would enable the use of TAEUS-enhanced ultrasound to guide thermoablative therapy, which uses heat or cold to remove tissue, such as in the treatment of cardiac atrial fibrillation, or removal of cancerous liver and kidney lesions, with greater accuracy.

  
  ●
Vascular Imaging: Our TAEUS technology enables ultrasound to view blood vessels from any angle, using only a saline solution contrasting agent, unlike Doppler ultrasound, which requires precise viewing angles. This capability would enable the use of TAEUS-enhanced ultrasound to easily identify arterial plaque or malformed vessels.

  
  ●
Tissue Perfusion: Our TAEUS technology enables ultrasound to image blood flow at the capillary level in a region, organ or tissue. This capability could be used to assist physicians in characterizing microvasculature fluid flows symptomatic of damaged tissue, such as internal bleeding from trauma, or diseased tissue, such as certain cancers.

   
 Because of the large number of traditional ultrasound systems currently in global use, we are first developing our TAEUS technology for sale as an aftermarket accessory that works with existing ultrasound systems. Because our TAEUS technology is designed to enhance the utility of, not replace, conventional ultrasound, we believe healthcare providers will be able to increase the utilization of, and generate new revenue from, their existing ultrasound systems once we obtain required regulatory approval for specific applications. We further believe that clinicians will be attracted to our technology because it will enable them to perform more procedures with existing ultrasound equipment, thereby retaining more imaging patients in their clinics rather than referring patients out to a regional medical center for a CT or MRI scan.
  
 ENDRA’s first clinical product will be designed to interface with a conventional ultrasound scanner, utilizing the scanner’s B-mode imaging to guide the selected region for assessment of liver fat content. The following sub-systems will comprise ENDRA’s first generation product.
  
 Radio Frequency (RF) Source and Computer:
  
 The RF source consists of a low power waveform generator and an amplifier. Together, these components provide the characteristic pulses required to excite thermoacoustic signals in tissue. The computer provides processing capability to both utilize the conventional ultrasound data for navigation to the measurement site of interest, and the calculations required to convert digitized thermoacoustic signals to measurements of fat in liver tissue. The entire sub-system will reside in a single enclosure, on wheels, and sit adjacent to the ultrasound imaging system.
Specialized Transducer:
  
 A single channel ‘receive only’ ultrasound transducer is specifically designed and optimized for thermoacoustic imaging. The transducer sub-system will detect thermoacoustic signals excited by the RF source within the liver. The transducer assembly includes electronics for signal amplification, digitization, and signal processing. The specialized transducer will attach to the conventional ultrasound probe used for liver imaging.

 RF Applicator:
  
 The RF applicator transmits pulses of energy, provided by the RF source, into tissue. The applicator is positioned in proximity to the target region for measurement.
  
 A second generation product is expected to provide two dimensional imaging with a transducer composed of multiple receive elements. The RF source and applicator will be similar to those in the first generation product but the multi-element transducer will allow for multiple applications including: reading tissue composition, temperature, vascular flow, tissue perfusion, and other potential applications. Ultimately, we expect our technology will be incorporated into conventional ultrasound systems and our business model will transition from producing stand-alone systems to licensing our technology, IP and specialized components to ultrasound OEMs. Existing ultrasound equipment already includes power supplies, computation, high speed electronics, and ultrasound transducers, which may be leveraged by our thermoacoustic imaging applications. The RF source and applicator are the principal hardware components that will be added to OEM ultrasound systems for the OEM fully integrated form of our product.
  
 We are following a model that mirrors the approach used by companies in the past to introduce new ultrasound imaging capabilities to existing conventional ultrasound scanners. Color Doppler, elastography, 3-D imaging, and high channel count systems were all introduced by new companies (not already involved in conventional ultrasound imaging). Historically, ultrasound imaging has grown through the introduction of unique technology and capabilities that expanded the applications and use of clinical ultrasound in a form that often added separate hardware to existing ultrasound systems. Ultimately, as these new technologies gained acceptance in the marketplace they were incorporated into OEM-designed and built systems that were sold by the leading ultrasound imaging vendors.
  
 Sales of ultrasound diagnostic equipment were approximately $4.4 billion globally in 2017 and are expected to grow at approximately 4.4% annually. There are an estimated 925,000 installed systems generating over 400 million annual diagnostic ultrasound procedures globally. Additionally, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 new and replacement systems are sold into the market each year. These numbers include both portable and cart-based ultrasound systems, and cover all types of diagnostic ultrasound procedures, including systems intended for cardiology, prenatal and abdominal use. We do not intend to address low-cost, portable ultrasound systems and systems focused on applications, such as prenatal care, where we believe our TAEUS technology will not substantially impact patient care. Accordingly, we define our addressable market for one or more of our TAEUS applications at approximately 338,000 cart-based ultrasound systems currently in use throughout the world.
  
  Potential Clinical Applications for our TAEUS Technology
  
  Early Diagnosis and Monitoring of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, or NAFLD
  
 Our first TAEUS platform application will focus on quantifying fat in the liver and stage progression of NAFLD which, untreated, can progress to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis, or NASH, cirrhosis and liver cancer. In 2011, over 1.4 billion people were affected by NAFLD/NASH. The World Gastroenterology Organisation considers NAFLD/NASH a global pandemic affecting rich and poor countries alike. Obesity, hepatitis, and diabetes are leading contributors to the development of NAFLD.
  
 Left untreated, an estimated 30% of NAFLD cases progress to NASH, a condition in which liver fat causes inflammation and decreased liver function, resulting in fatigue, weight loss, muscle pain and abdominal pain.
  
 Approximately 25% of NASH cases progress to liver fibrosis, in which liver inflammation causes scar tissue which eventually prevents the liver from functioning properly. The scar tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and slows the processing of nutrients, hormones, drugs, and naturally produced toxins. It also slows the production of proteins and other substances made by the liver. Once a patient develops cirrhosis of the liver, the only life-saving therapy is a liver transplant. Additionally, cirrhosis patients may develop liver cancer. In 2018, the World Health Organization estimated that liver cancer kills 782,000 people annually. Because of the increased incidence of obesity, hepatitis and diabetes throughout the world, NAFLD has become the most common chronic liver disease and an important cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer worldwide.
  
 Despite the increased incidence of NAFLD and its role in the development of NASH, cirrhosis and liver cancer, we believe that no low-cost, accurate and safe method exists for measuring fat in the liver. Current liver enzyme blood tests are indicative, but cannot reliably confirm early stage NAFLD or NASH, and liver enzyme levels are normal in a large percentage of patients with NAFLD. Existing ultrasound technology can only measure fat qualitatively in the liver at moderate to severe levels, typically greater than 30% liver fat, and ultrasound has low accuracy when used on obese patients. While early stage NAFLD and NASH can be confirmed by an MRI scan, an MRI scan is expensive, and MRI systems are not widely available or practical for many patients. A surgical biopsy can be used to confirm NAFLD and NASH, but is also expensive, involves a painful procedure and exposes patients to the risk of infection. Furthermore, MRIs and surgical biopsies are impractical for repeated screening and monitoring of liver disease. We believe these limitations negatively impact the diagnosis and treatment of patients with NAFLD.

 Patients diagnosed with NAFLD and related liver diseases are typically treated with therapies such as statins, insulin sensitizers and other compounds and are encouraged to adopt lifestyle changes to improve their overall health.
  
 A significant number of pharmaceutical compounds targeting liver disease are in development by companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Genfit SA, Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Allergan plc, and Immuron Limited.
  
 Billions of dollars are spent annually on the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD and related liver diseases. In the United States alone, the median Medicare inpatient charge per NAFLD patient is estimated to be $36,000 and the total annual direct medical costs for NAFLD are estimated to be $103 billion. Identification and staging of NAFLD is central to determining the course of treatment.
  
 In addition, patients receiving treatment for NAFLD-spectrum liver diseases must continue to be monitored to assess disease progression and the efficacy of treatment. Because of the high cost and limited global availability, CT and MRI technology is not typically used for this function.
  
 We believe our TAEUS technology will enable primary care physicians, radiologists and hepatologists to diagnose NAFLD earlier and monitor patients with NAFLD-spectrum liver diseases more accurately and cost-effectively than is possible with existing technology.
  
  Image below: Depiction of ex-vivo TAEUS tissue composition analysis overlaid on traditional ultrasound image. First version of TAEUS is expected to assess fat in liver only.
  
   In April 2016, we entered into a Collaborative Research Agreement with General Electric Company, acting through its GE Healthcare business unit and the GE Global Research Center (collectively, “GE Healthcare”). Under the terms of the agreement, GE Healthcare has agreed to assist us in our efforts to commercialize our TAEUS technology for use in a fatty liver application by, among other things, providing equipment and technical advice, and facilitating introductions to GE Healthcare clinical ultrasound customers. In return for this assistance, we have agreed to afford GE Healthcare certain rights of first offer with respect to manufacturing and licensing rights for the target application. More specifically, we have agreed that, prior to commercially releasing our NAFLD TAEUS application, we will offer to negotiate an exclusive ultrasound manufacturer relationship with GE Healthcare for a period of at least one year of commercial sales. The commercial sales would involve, within our sole discretion, either our commercially selling GE Healthcare ultrasound systems as the exclusive ultrasound system with our TAEUS fatty liver application embedded, or GE Healthcare being the exclusive ultrasound manufacturer to sell ultrasound systems with our TAEUS fatty liver application embedded. The agreement with GE Healthcare does not prevent us from selling our TAEUS fatty liver application technology to distributors or directly to non-manufacturer purchasers. Additionally, the agreement provides that (1) prior to offering to license any of our TAEUS fatty liver application intellectual property to a third party, we will first offer to negotiate to license our TAEUS fatty liver application intellectual property to GE Healthcare and (2) prior to selling any equity interests to a healthcare device manufacturer, we must first offer to negotiate in good faith to sell such equity interests to GE Healthcare. The agreement is subject to termination by either party upon not less than 60 days’ notice. On January 30, 2018, we and GE Healthcare entered into an amendment to our agreement, extending its term by 21 months to January 22, 2020.
  
 In November 2017 we engaged two firms that specialize in medical device software development to commence productization of our TAEUS device targeting NAFLD. The agreements call for these vendors to provide us with the specialized engineering resources necessary to translate our current prototype TAEUS device into a clinical product that meets CE regulatory requirements required for commercial launch in the European Union followed by FDA submission for the U.S. market.
 
 In October 2018, we received an Investigational Testing Authorization (“ITA”) from Health Canada to commence the first human studies in healthy volunteers with our TAEUS clinical system targeting NAFLD, guiding our algorithm development, and comparing our technology to MRI. The feasibility study is being conducted in collaboration with the widely respected Robarts Research Institute in London, Canada. The data Robarts Research Institute is collecting with our investigational device includes the following:
 
  ● 
 Integration evaluation of hardware and software design elements of the TAEUS platform;


  ● 
 Substantial user and patient human-factors data, including clinical workflow and ergonomic considerations to support our CE mark application and commercial product design; and


  ● 
 Quantitative MRI liver fat fraction measurements for each study subject, that will both guide our algorithm development and provide data for initial correlation to the TAEUS measurements.

 In December 2018, Robarts Research Institute completed its initial healthy subject enrollment and data collection of 25 subjects and received authorization from Health Canada to expand the study to 50 subjects. We expect to receive study results in the first quarter of 2019. The data collected from the study, including additional usability inputs, will be included in our TAEUS liver device technical file submission for device CE Mark, which we anticipate in the first half of 2019.
  
  Temperature Monitoring of Thermoablative Surgery
  
 We also intend to develop a TAEUS platform application to guide thermal ablation surgery, such as in the treatment of cardiac atrial fibrillation, chronic pain and lesions of the liver, thyroid, kidneys and other soft tissues. We plan to target clinical users of thermoablative technology, including interventional radiologists, cardiologists, gynecologists and surgical oncologists.
  
 Thermoablation involves the use of heat or cold to remove malfunctioning or diseased tissue in surgical oncology, cardiology, neurology, gynecology, and urology applications. Thermoablative technologies include RF, microwave, laser and cryogenic ablation. The worldwide market for RF surgical ablation procedures alone was estimated in 2015 to be $3.7 billion per annum, generating over 5 million annual RF ablation procedures and growing at approximately 18% annually. We believe that the growth of this market is driven primarily by the aging global population requiring more cardiac and cancer procedures, as well as the relative ease-of-use and low cost of thermoablative technologies when compared to open surgery.
  
 However, RF and other thermoablative surgery technologies pose risks, including under-treatment of diseased tissue and unintended thermal damage to areas outside the treatment area. For example, it has been reported that patients receiving RF ablation of liver tumors have experienced thermal injury to the diaphragm, gallbladder, bile ducts and gastrointestinal tract, some of which have resulted in patient deaths.
  
 Clinicians must rely on printed manufacturer guidelines to plan procedures using thermal ablation technologies or, when available, monitor tissue temperature changes in real-time with MRI imaging or surgical temperature probes. We believe these existing methods either lack real-time precision or are impractical due to cost, poor availability and other factors.
  
 We believe that the ability to visualize changes in tissue temperature in real time could potentially enhance the effectiveness and safety of thermoablation therapies and that our TAEUS technology platform combined with traditional ultrasound has the potential to guide thermoablation surgery more cost-effectively and more accurately than existing methods.
  
  Image below: Depiction of ex-vivo TAEUS tissue temperature analysis overlaid on traditional ultrasound image.
  

  Vascular Imaging
  
 We believe that our TAEUS technology can be used to image blood vessels and distinguish them from the surrounding tissue. In addition to our NAFLD and thermoablation applications, we intend to develop a cardiovascular application based on our TAEUS technology that, with the use of a standard saline contrast agent, can enable existing ultrasound systems to perform a number of cardiovascular diagnostic functions, such as identifying arterial plaque or blocked or malformed vessels, as well as safely guiding biopsies away from vital vasculature.
  
 Conventional ultrasound imaging systems use Doppler imaging in a variety of vascular applications. Doppler ultrasound, which images the velocity of blood, is effective in larger vessels and regions where blood velocity is high. However, Doppler ultrasound is not sufficiently sensitive for use in very small vessels or in vascular imaging applications where blood velocities are very low. For these applications, contrast enhanced CT and MRI angiography is used which requires the patient to be injected with a contrast agent, iodinated compounds and gadolinium, respectively. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans both require referral for examination after initial screening with ultrasound and carry risks associated with their respective contrast agents. We believe that our TAEUS platform application has the potential to offer the advantages of CT and MR contrast enhanced imaging at the point of care using only a safe electrolyte solution as the contrast agent.

  Tissue Perfusion or “Leakiness”
  
 We believe that our TAEUS technology can be used to image tissue perfusion, or the absorption of fluids into an organ or tissue. We intend to develop an application for our TAEUS platform that would enable ultrasound detection of microvasculature fluid flows symptomatic of tissue compromised by trauma or disease.
  
 When a person’s body is affected by disease or trauma, blood and other fluids may leak from damaged tissues in subtle ways. Traditional ultrasound cannot effectively image these disruptions in microvascular permeability, but we believe ultrasound combined with our TAEUS technology can.
  
 We believe that using our TAEUS technology physicians will be able to quickly and clearly see tissue compromised by disease, such as cancer, or trauma, especially with the use of a standard saline contrast agent, when CT or MRI is not readily available.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and other agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights. We require our officers, employees and consultants to enter into standard agreements containing provisions requiring confidentiality of proprietary information and assignment to us of all inventions made during the course of their employment or consulting relationship. We also enter into nondisclosure agreements with our commercial counterparties and limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information.
  
 We are committed to developing and protecting our intellectual property and, where appropriate, filing patent applications to protect our technology. Our issued and pending patents claims are directed at the following areas related to our technology:
   
  ●
Methods to induce and enhance thermoacoustic signal generation;

  
  ●
System configurations, devices and novel hardware for transmission of RF pulses into tissue and detection of acoustic signals;

  
  ●
Methods for integrating our devices with existing conventional ultrasound systems; and

  
  ●
Methods and algorithms for signal processing, image formation and analysis.

   
 We currently maintain a patent portfolio consisting of nine (9) patents issued in the United States and two (2) issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, seventeen (17) patent applications pending in the United States and sixteen (16) patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions relating to our technology. These patents and patent applications cover certain innovations relating to contrast-enhanced imaging as well as several aspects of fat imaging and fat quantitation in the liver and other tissues.
  
 In addition, we have in-licensed license three (3) U.S. patents. These patents protect a number of key design attributes that are specific to our Nexus 128 product.
  
 Each of our patents generally has a term of 20 years from its respective priority filing date. Among our issued patents, the first patents are set to expire in 2018 and the last patents expire in 2031.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
 We currently do not have a sales and marketing team dedicated to our TAEUS clinical applications. In parallel to securing all necessary government marketing approvals, we intend to hire a small internal marketing team to engage and support channel partners and clinical customers. As we previously did with our Nexus 128 system, we intend to partner with several geographically-focused independent clinical ultrasound equipment distributors to market and sell our TAEUS applications. We believe that these distributors have existing customer relationships, a strong knowledge of diagnostic imaging technology and the capabilities to support the installation, customer training and post-sale service of capital equipment and software.
  
 We also intend to work with original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, of ultrasound and thermal ablation equipment to sell our TAEUS applications alongside their own new systems and into their existing installed base systems. We believe that these OEMs will find our applications attractive as they will enable them to generate additional revenue from their installed systems – as they currently do with aftermarket accessory portfolios. We believe our relationship with GE Healthcare will facilitate this strategy.
  
   
11


  
 
 Based on our design work and our understanding of the ultrasound accessory market, we intend to price our initial NAFLD TAEUS application at a price point approximating $40,000 to $50,000, which should enable purchasers to recoup their investment in less than one year by performing a relatively small number of additional ultrasound procedures.
  
 Some of our TAEUS offerings are expected to be implemented via a hardware platform that can run multiple individual software applications that we will offer TAEUS users for a one-time licensing fee, enabling users to perform more procedures with their existing ultrasound equipment and retaining more patients in their clinics rather than referring them out to a regional imaging medical center for a CT or MRI scan.
  
 We also intend to license our TAEUS technology to OEMs, such as GE Healthcare, for incorporation in their new ultrasound systems.
  
  Engineering, Design and Manufacturing
  
  Development of TAEUS Device
  
 We have contracted with StarFish Product Engineering, Inc. (“StarFish”), a medical device contract manufacturing company, to commence the productization of our NAFLD TAEUS application. In particular, we have retained StarFish to develop ENDRA’s current prototype TAEUS device into a clinical product that meets CE regulatory requirements required for commercial launch. We expect to further engage StarFish to support our application for a CE mark that will enable us to sell the application in the European Union as a Class IIa medical device once a final design for our TAEUS device has been developed and tested, and to lead the preparation of documentation for regulatory approval submission both in the European Union and in the United States. In order to foster collaboration, our Chief Technology Officer regularly visits StarFish’s facilities to monitor the TAEUS application manufacturing process.
  
 We believe that our contract manufacturers will either supply necessary components internally or obtain them from third-party sources. At this time, we do not know whether any components are or will be single sourced.
  
  Regulatory Approval Pathway and Human Study
  
 Each of our TAEUS platform applications will require regulatory approvals before we are able to sell or license the application. Based on certain factors, such as the installed base of ultrasound systems, availability of other imaging technologies, such as CT and MRI, economic strength and applicable regulatory requirements, we intend to seek initial approval of our applications for sale in the European Union, followed by the United States and China.
  
 The first TAEUS application we intend to commercialize is our NAFLD TAEUS application. Our initial target market for this application is the European Union. We believe that our NAFLD TAEUS application will qualify for sale in the European Union as a Class IIa medical device. As a result, we will be required to obtain a CE mark for our NAFLD TAEUS application before we can sell the application in the European Union. To this end, we have contracted with medical device contract engineering firms to perform the commercial product engineering for our NAFLD TAEUS application. Existing regulations would not require us to conduct a clinical trial to obtain a CE mark for this application. Nonetheless, for commercial reasons and to support our CE mark application we have contracted with CIMTEC, a medical imaging research group, to conduct human studies through Canada-based Robarts Research Institute to demonstrate our NAFLD TAEUS application’s ability to distinguish fat from lean tissue. In December 2018, Robarts Research Institute completed its initial healthy subject enrollment and data collection of 25 subjects and received authorization from Health Canada to expand the study to 50 subjects.
  
 In 2012, the European Commission proposed a new regulatory scheme that, if implemented, will impose significant additional obligations on medical device companies. Expected changes include stricter requirements for clinical evidence and pre-market assessment of safety and performance, new classifications to indicate risk levels, requirements for third party testing by government accredited groups for some types of medical devices, and tightened and streamlined quality management system assessment procedures. It is anticipated that this new regulatory scheme may be implemented prior to receipt of the CE mark for our NAFLD TAEUS application, but we believe that applicable transition rules should allow us to avoid their application in that case. However, such new rules could impose additional requirements, such as a requirement to conduct clinical trials, on future CE mark applications we make.
  
 After the process of obtaining a CE mark for our NAFLD TAEUS application is complete and if we are able to raise additional capital, we intend to prepare for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), an application under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) to sell our NAFLD TAEUS application in the U.S. We anticipate that the application, as well as those for our other TAEUS applications, will be submitted for approval under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act. We expect that our initial FDA clearance will allow us to sell the NAFLD TAEUS application in the U.S. with general imaging claims. However, we will need to obtain additional FDA clearances to be able to make diagnostic claims for fatty tissue content determination. Accordingly, to support our commercialization efforts we expect that, following receipt of our initial FDA clearance, we will submit one or more additional applications to the FDA, each of which will need to include additional clinical trial data, so that following receipt of the necessary clearances we may make those diagnostic claims.

  Regulation
  
  European Union
  
 The primary regulatory environment in Europe is the European Union, which consists of 28 member states encompassing most of the major countries in Europe. We believe that in the European Union applications incorporating our TAEUS technology will be regulated as Class IIa medical devices by the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) and the European Union Commission. As described above, we expect our applications will receive a CE mark from an appropriate Competent Authority as a result of successful review of one or more submissions prepared by our contract engineering and manufacturer(s), so that such applications can be marketed and distributed within the European Economic Area. Each of our applications will be required to be recertified each year for CE marking, which recertification may require an annual audit. The audit procedure, which will include on-site visits at our facility, and the contract manufacturer’s(s’) facility(ies), will require us to provide the contract manufacturer(s) with information and documentation concerning our quality management system and all applicable documents, policies, procedures, manuals, and other information.
  
 In the European Union, the manufacturer of medical devices is subject to current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with cGMP is generally assessed by a Notified Body accredited by a Competent Authority. For a Class IIa device, typically, quality system evaluation is performed by the Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant Competent Authority for the European community whether a device will receive a CE mark. The Notified Body may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each application, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the application.
  
  FDA Regulation
  
 Each of our products must be approved or cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our applications are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FD&C Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. The FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products.
  
  FDA Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices
  
 In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
   
  ●
Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations;

  
  ●
Class II: special controls, premarket notification (510(k)), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries and post-market surveillance and additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and

  
  ●
Class III: special controls and approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application.

   
 We expect all of our products to be classified as Class II medical devices and require FDA authorization prior to marketing by means of a 510(k) clearance.
  
 To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than a legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. The typical duration to receive a 510(k) approval is approximately nine to twelve months from the date of the initial 510(k) submission, although there is no guarantee that the timing will not be longer.

 In the past, the 510(k) pathway for product marketing has required only proof of substantial equivalence in technology for a given indication with a previously cleared device. Recently, there has been a trend of the FDA requiring additional clinical work to prove efficacy in addition to technological equivalence and basic safety. Whether clinical data is provided or not, the FDA may decide to reject the substantial equivalence argument we present. If that happens, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which may determine that the new device is of low to moderate risk and that it can be appropriately be regulated as a Class I or II device. If a de novo request is granted, the device may be legally marketed and a new classification is established. If the device is classified as Class II, the device may serve as a predicate for future 510(k) submissions. If the device is not approved through de novo review, then it must go through the standard PMA process for Class III devices.
  
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, a PMA. If the FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, then a company must submit, and the FDA must approve, a PMA before marketing can begin.
  
 A PMA application must provide a demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which generally requires extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data. Information about the device and its components, device design, manufacturing and labeling, among other information, must also be included in the PMA. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with quality system regulation requirements, which govern testing, control, documentation and other aspects of quality assurance with respect to manufacturing. If the FDA determines the application or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. During the review period, a FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians and statisticians, is likely to be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision. While the FDA often follows the panel’s recommendation, there have been instances in which the FDA has not. The FDA must find the information to be satisfactory in order to approve the PMA. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, or requirements to do additional clinical studies after approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required to authorize certain modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA. The typical duration to receive PMA approval is approximately two years from the date of submission of the initial PMA application, although there is no guarantee that the timing will not be longer.
  
  Clinical Trials of Medical Devices
  
 One or more clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and more recently are becoming necessary to support a 510(k) submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an investigational device exemption application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The investigational device exemption will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board has approved the study.
  
 During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s investigational device exemption requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. The sponsor, the FDA, or the institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.

  Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
  
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
   
  ●
the FDA quality systems regulation, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products;

  
  ●
labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and

  
  ●
the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product.

   
  Good Manufacturing Practices Requirements
  
 Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with the good manufacturing practices set forth in the quality system regulation promulgated under Section 520 of the FD&C Act. Current good manufacturing practices regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facility for an approved product must be registered with the FDA and meet current good manufacturing practices requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-PMA approval inspection before the facility can be used. Manufacturers, including third party contract manufacturers, are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other authorities to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.
 China Regulation
  
 China’s regulatory approval framework includes nationwide approval based on a showing that the device for which approval is sought has been previously approved in the country of origin. Alternatively, we understand it is also possible to receive approval at the provincial level or to work exclusively with hospitals that do not require such nationwide or provincial approval. We intend to explore these potential paths to regulatory compliance in China.
 Other Regulations
  
 We will become subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Additionally, third parties designing, manufacturing or conducting human studies of our devices will be subject to local regulations, such as those of Health Canada. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for EMA or FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from EMA and FDA requirements.
 Competition
  
 While we believe that we are the only company developing RF-based thermoacoustic ultrasound products, we will face direct and indirect competition from a number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, sales and marketing and other resources than we do.
  
 Manufacturers of CT and MRI systems include multi-national corporations such as Royal Philips, Siemens AG and Hitachi, Ltd., many of whom also manufacture and sell ultrasound equipment. In the NAFLD diagnosis market we will compete with makers of surgical biopsy tools, such as Cook Medical and Sterylab S.r.l. In the thermal ablation market, we will compete with manufacturers of surgical temperature probes, such as Medtronic plc and St. Jude Medical, Inc.

  Research and Development
  
 Our research and development expenses were $4,722,465 and $1,931,075 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
  
  Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 11 employees, all of whom are employed on a full-time basis. 8 full-time employees were engaged in research and development activities, 2 full-time employees were engaged in administrative activities, and 1 full-time employee was engaged in product assembly. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
  
 We also employ technical advisors, on an as-needed basis, to supplement existing staff. We believe that these technical advisors provide us with necessary expertise in clinical ultrasound applications, ultrasound technology, and intellectual property.
