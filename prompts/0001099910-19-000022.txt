Our History
 
Enviro Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Idaho on October 19, 1964, under the name Idaho Silver, Inc. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Florida Precision Aerospace, Inc., a Florida corporation (“FPA”), was incorporated on February 26, 1993. Effective November 10, 2017 we filed Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing the Company’s name from Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. to “Enviro Technologies, Inc.”.
General
 
The Company developed and currently manufactures the patented Voraxial® Separator (“Voraxial® Separator” or “Voraxial®”) pursuant to the agreements discussed below. The Voraxial® Separator is a proprietary technology now owned by Schlumberger (as defined below) that efficiently separates large volumes of liquid/liquid, liquid/solids or liquid/liquid/solids fluid mixtures with distinct specific gravities. Per the agreements we signed with Schlumberger, we continue to manufacture the technology for Schlumberger for the oil and gas industry and have a non-exclusive license to pursue other industries independent of Schlumberger, which include mining, sewage, wastewater as well as other markets. We have rebranded the technology as V-Inline for other industries.
 
On March 13, 2017, we entered into a Technology Purchase Agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation, a Texas corporation, Schlumberger Canada Limited, a Canadian entity, and Schlumberger B.V., an entity organized under the laws of the Netherlands (collectively, “Schlumberger”) which was approved by the Company’s shareholders on May 31, 2017 and completed on June 8, 2017. Under the agreement we sold our intellectual property (the “Purchased Intellectual Property”), substantially consisting of the Voraxial patents, marks, software and copyrights, to Schlumberger in consideration of $4,000,000, of which $3,000,000 was paid at closing and the balance was paid in August 2018 upon the completion of both: (i) the complete transfer of the intellectually property to Schlumberger; and (ii) the provision to transfer information, assets and services to Schlumberger.
 
We utilized a portion of the proceeds from this transaction to pay most of our outstanding debt and are using the balance for general working capital. We are also using some of the proceeds to buy additional manufacturing equipment to meet potential future sales.
 
As part of the agreement, Schlumberger granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free licenses (the “Grant Back Licenses”), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes embodying the Purchase Intellectual Property outside the oil and gas market. Under the terms of the agreement, we can no longer use the tradename Voraxial. We branded the technology licensed to us the “V-Inline”. Our management believes that the Grant Back Licenses can potentially provide additional revenues through the sale of V-inline Separators outside the oil and gas industry, including, but not limited to mining, sewage and industrial wastewater.
 
In addition, pursuant to the Technology Purchase Agreement FPA entered into a Framework Agreement on June 8, 2017 (the “Supply Agreement”) with Cameron Solutions, Inc. (“Cameron Solutions”), a Houston, Texas-based company and affiliate of Schlumberger engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of equipment used in the oil and gas industry. Under the terms of the three-year Supply Agreement, FPA is the exclusive supplier to Cameron Solutions of certain Voraxial series products for use in the oil and gas industry. Sales will be made from time to time in accordance with the terms of purchase orders. The Supply Agreement is cancellable by Cameron Solutions upon 15 days’ notice if we fail to meet delivery or performance schedules or breaches any of the terms of the agreement, including the warranties. Cameron Solutions may also cancel the Supply Agreement without notice in the event we become insolvent or commit any act of bankruptcy. The Supply Agreement contains customary indemnification and confidentiality provisions. There are no assurances that we will generate material revenues under the Grant Back Licenses or Supply Agreement. There are no minimum purchase requirements for Cameron Solutions under the Supply Agreement.
 
For a period of three years following the closing of the Technology Purchase Agreement, the Company and our officers and directors (Raynard Veldman and John Di Bella), have agreed to not participate or cause participation in the oil-and-gas market in relation to phase or constituent sensing or separation which is defined as, liquid-liquid, liquid-solid or liquid-gas separation and

gas or liquid sensing, including all product lines and services related thereto and including the Voraxial product line and services, except to the extent necessary to: (i) repair or service, but not remanufacture, any goods the Company sold to third persons prior to closing; (ii) fulfill, on or after closing, any customer obligation; or (iii) comply with any term or condition of the agreement.
 
We received an order from a utility company for multiple V-Inline Separators to separate solids and oil from their wastewater stream. The V-Inline Separators will be used to process and separate oil and solids from a flow of about 120 gallons per minute. The System will include different technologies with the heart of the system being comprised of two V 2000 Separators working in parallel with a third V-Inline being utilized to further dewater the reject lines from the System. We anticipate shipping the system in the third quarter 2019.
 
Separation Technology - The Grant Back License and Supply Agreement
 
Pursuant to the Technology Purchase Agreement, the Company signed a Supply Agreement to manufacture the Voraxial Separator for Schlumberger for a period of 3 years and a Grant Back License to sell the technology (branded as V-Inline) in other markets outside of the oil and gas markets. The V-Inline Separator is a continuous flow turbo machine that generates a strong centrifugal force, a vortex, capable of separating light and heavy liquids, such as oil and water, or any other combination of liquids and solids at extremely high flow rates. As the fluid passes through the machine, the V-Inline Separator accomplishes this separation through the creation of a vortex. In liquid/liquid and liquid/solid mixtures, this vortex causes the heavier compounds to gravitate to the outside of the flow and the lighter elements to move to the center where an inner core is formed. The liquid stream processed by the machine is divided into separate streams of heavier and lighter liquids and solids. As a result of this process, separation is achieved.
 
The benefits of the V-Inline Separator include:
 

- | High volume / small footprint 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


- | No Pressure drop requirement 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


- | High G force 
--+------------------------------------------------------


- | Treats a wide range of flows, even slugging flows 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Handles fluctuation in flow rates without any adjustments 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Handles fluctuation in contaminates without any adjustments 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Separation of 2 or 3 components simultaneously 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Non-clogging - open rotor assembly 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Low maintenance with ease of operation and installation 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Can operate dry 
--+---------------------------------------------------------


- | Since there is no pressure drop, there is very little wear caused by sand 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The V-Inline Separator is a self-contained, non-clogging device that can be powered by an electric motor, diesel engine or by hydraulic power generation. Further, its scalability allows it to be utilized in a variety of industries and to process various amounts of liquid. The following are the various sizes and the corresponding capacity range:
 

Model | | Diameter | | Capacity Range 
-------+-------+----------+----------+-------------------
Number | | Size | | Gallons Per Minute
 | V1000 | | 1 inch | 3 | -5 
 | V2000 | | 2 inches | 20 | -70 
 | V4000 | | 4 inches | 100 | -500 
 | V8000 | | 8 inches | 1,000 | -3,500

 
We believe that if sales of this technology by Schlumberger materialize in the oil and gas markets, we will have the resources and opportunity under the Grant Back Licenses to pursue other industries on a cost-effective basis, including: mining, municipal wastewater treatment, industrial wastewater, and numerous other industrial production and environmental remediation processes. As clean water becomes less available to the ever-increasing world population, this technology may become more valuable.

The Market
 
The need for effective and cost efficient wastewater treatment and separation technology is global in scale. Moreover, virtually every industry requires some type of separation process either during the manufacturing process, prior to treatment or discharge of wastewater into the environment, for general clean up, or emergency response capability. Separation processes, however, are largely unknown to the average consumer. These processes are deeply integrated in almost all industrial processes from oil to wastewater to manufacturing. Management believes that the separation technology has applications in most, if not all major separation industries. The unique characteristics of the technology allow it to be utilized either as a stand-alone unit or within an existing system to provide a more efficient and cost effective way to handle the separation needs of the customer. We believe the separation technology can result in a cost savings and other benefits to the customer. These benefits result in and include:

● | A reduction in water and energy usage, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Requires no pressure drop to perform separation, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Less space needed to implement the Voraxial Separator, the Voraxial Separator weights less than existing systems, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A reduction time to process and separate the fluids, allowing the customer to be more efficient, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creation of more efficient and faster process to treat water to increase the overall productivity of the end-user, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fewer employees needed to operate the system, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction of ongoing maintenance and servicing costs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that this separation technology is a unique front-end solution for the separation industry that can offer increased productivity while reducing the physical space and energy required to operate the unit. These advantages translate into the potential for substantial operating cost efficiencies that would increase the profitability of the solution’s end user. The unique characteristic to conduct separation without a pressure loss allows the unit to be installed in locations other technologies cannot. For instance, another separation technology called a hydrocyclone requires a significant pressure loss to perform separation.
 
As environmental regulations, both domestically and internationally, have become more stringent, companies have been required to more effectively treat their wastewater prior to discharge. We believe the Grant Back License offers a great opportunity for the Company as the separation technology can be utilized in most separation applications to significantly increase the efficiency of the separation processes while simultaneously reduce the cost to the end-user.
 
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture and assemble the products at our Fort Lauderdale, Florida facilities.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials
 
The materials needed to manufacture the components of the products we sell, including the Separation Technology, have been provided by leading companies in the precision equipment industry. We do not have any long term contracts with any supplier. We do not anticipate any shortage of component parts.
Inventory
 
We maintain a limited inventory of finished parts until we receive a customer order. Most of our inventory is comprised of raw materials, work in process and finished Separator components that can be used for future sales.
Marketing
 
Prior to the Technology Purchase Agreement, Management developed relationships with oil service companies and representatives to promote the technology to oil industry customers. Since the Technology Purchase Agreement, we have focused our resources to develop a strong rapport with Schlumberger, which includes scaling up our manufacturing capabilities. In addition, we started to pursue projects in industries outside of the oil and gas market, which resulted in a purchase order from a utility customer. We started to market the V-Inline to companies outside of the oil and gas industry. This process is slower than anticipated as the sales from Schlumberger have not met initial management expectations thus far. We anticipated using the revenues from Schlumberger to invest in new applications and industries for the V-Inline. As these sales did not

materialize as timely as we had planned, the marketing activity in other industries has been slow. The Company does not currently have plans to present at tradeshows in 2019.
 
Intellectual property
 
Under the Technology Purchase Agreement, we sold the Purchased Intellectual Property. We currently hold no patents.
 
Product liability
 
Our business exposes us to possible claims of personal injury, death or property damage, which may result from the failure, or malfunction of any component or subassembly manufactured or assembled by us. We have product liability insurance. However, any product liability claim made against us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in light of our poor financial condition, losses and limited revenues. We have also obtained directors and officers, and general insurance coverage.
 
Competition
 
We are subject to competition from other manufacturing facilities who have greater manufacturing capacity, which allows them to utilize economy of scale to reduce cost. We are also subject to competition from a number of companies who have greater experience, research abilities, engineering capability and financial resources than we have to market and sell separation technology. Although we believe the separation technology offers applications which accomplish better or similar results on a more cost-effective basis than existing products, other products have, in some instances, attained greater market and regulatory acceptance.
Employees
 
We currently have seven employees. All of our employees work full-time. None of our employees are members of a union. We believe that our relationship with our employees is favorable. We intend to add additional employees in the upcoming year related to manufacturing and sales.
