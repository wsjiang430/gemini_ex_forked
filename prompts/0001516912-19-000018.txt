Item 1.    Business
Our Company
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "we," "us," "our," "our company," "the Company" or "Origin" refer to Origin Bancorp, Inc., a Louisiana corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. All references to "Origin Bank" or "the Bank" refer to Origin Bank, our wholly owned bank subsidiary. 
We are a financial holding company headquartered in Ruston, Louisiana. Our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Origin Bank, was founded in 1912. Deeply rooted in our history is a culture committed to providing personalized, relationship banking to our clients and communities. We provide a broad range of financial services to small and medium-sized businesses, municipalities, high net worth individuals and retail clients. We currently operate 41 banking centers from Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas across North Louisiana to Central Mississippi, which we refer to as the I-20 Corridor, as well as in Houston, Texas. As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $4.82 billion, total loans of $3.84 billion, total deposits of $3.78 billion and total stockholders' equity of $549.8 million.
We completed an initial public offering of our common stock in May 2018 as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"). Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "OBNK."
We are committed to building unique client experiences through a strong culture, experienced leadership team and a focus on delivering unmatched customer service throughout Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Our success has been based on (1) a talented team of relationship bankers, executives and directors, (2) a diverse footprint with stable and growth-oriented markets, (3) differentiated and customized delivery and service, (4) our core deposit franchise and (5) an ability to significantly leverage our infrastructure and technology.
Successful execution of our strategic plan has produced significant growth in our franchise. Since 2005, we have enhanced our growth by integrating three bank acquisitions, entering several expansion markets, expanding our product offerings in mortgage lending, mortgage servicing as well as in insurance and private banking. Through these efforts, we have successfully increased our market share in each of our key geographic markets. To support our growth, we have raised over $281.8 million of new capital since 2006, including proceeds from our initial public offering completed in May 2018. We have also supplemented our entry into expansion markets by hiring a number of experienced in-market bankers and banking teams.
Our Competitive Strengths and Banking Strategy
Organic Growth Capabilities with Strategic Acquisitions
We have demonstrated our historical ability to grow our loans and deposits organically. Our team of seasoned bankers has been an important driver of our organic growth by further developing banking relationships with current and potential clients. Our relationship bankers are motivated to increase the size of their loan and deposit portfolios and generate fee income while maintaining strong credit quality. To promote our organic growth, we strategically locate banking centers within our markets and employ highly experienced relationship bankers who proactively develop valuable relationships within the communities that we serve. Through these relationships, our bankers are able to capitalize on loan demand across a wide range of industries. This allows us to not only diversify our loan portfolio, but also focus on loans with quality credit characteristics.
4

We focus on generating core deposits and, in particular, noninterest-bearing deposits, as our primary funding source to support loan growth. We believe motivating our relationship bankers to generate strong core, noninterest-bearing deposit growth enhances our ability to build and strengthen client relationships and provide stable funding for future growth.
We also intend to continue pursuing selective acquisition opportunities that we expect will enhance our business model in markets across our attractive geographic footprint. 
A Unique from Within Client Experience
Our mission is to passionately pursue ways to make banking more rewarding for our customers, employees, stockholders and communities by providing a unique client experience. We recognize that providing a distinguished client service begins with a commitment to building, training and retaining a customer-focused team that exemplifies our core values. Relationships built upon trust, encouraging a strong work ethic, innovation, flexibility and forward-thinking, genuine respect for others, cultivating a commitment to our community and never compromising on integrity are the benchmarks of our values and our promise is to make every customer feel like our only customer, every time.
Concentration on Sound Asset Quality
We believe that asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. We seek to maintain sound asset quality by moderating credit risk and adhering to prudent lending practices and by promoting a relationship-based approach to commercial and consumer banking. Our executive management team has extensive knowledge of the bank regulatory landscape, significant experience navigating interest rate and credit cycles and a long history of collaboration, which we believe may help us avoid or mitigate unforeseen losses.
Expanding Revenue Sources
We offer commercial and retail customers a wide range of products and services that provide us with a diversified revenue stream and help us to solidify customer relationships. We provide products and services that compete with large, national banks, but with the personalized attention and responsiveness of a relationship-focused community bank. Our offerings include traditional retail deposits, treasury management, commercial deposits, mortgage origination and servicing, insurance, mobile banking and online banking. Our clients value our ability to provide the sophisticated products and services of larger banks, but with a local and agile decision-making process, a focus on building personal relationships, and a commitment to investing in the local economy and community. This allows us to build Origin Bank on low-cost core deposit relationships, high credit quality loans, and fee income generated by value-added services. It also allows us to develop strong relationships across industries, creating a diverse commercial loan portfolio.
We believe we have an attractive mix of loans and deposits. As of December 31, 2018, our loans held for investment portfolio was comprised of 39.1% commercial and industrial loans, and 43.7% commercial real estate loans. This focus on commercial lending increases the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet, positioning us well for a rising-rate environment, and provides potential growth opportunities due to our limited real estate concentrations. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 25.1% of our deposits were noninterest-bearing demand deposits and our cost of total deposits was 0.81% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our Markets
We currently operate in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, North Louisiana, Central Mississippi, as well as Houston, Texas, all of which offer an attractive combination of diversity, growth and stability. The Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston markets provide attractive economic environments and offer significant deposit and lending opportunities as they are home to many large and mid-size corporations across a wide range of industries that include healthcare, manufacturing, higher education, agriculture, transportation and technology.
Our legacy markets in North Louisiana offer a stable economic climate and a lower cost deposit-gathering and operational platform. Our footprint in Central Mississippi comprises areas of significant commercial growth and investment. We believe all of our markets consist of vibrant areas of the United States with favorable business climates and significant population and employment growth.

Our Banking Services
We offer products and services through a network of 41 retail branch offices. We are focused on delivering a broad range of relationship-driven financial services tailored to meet the needs of small and medium-sized businesses, municipalities, high net worth individuals and retail clients in North Louisiana, Central Mississippi, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston, Texas. We principally operate in one business segment, community banking. We are primarily engaged in attracting deposits from individuals and businesses and using these deposits and borrowed funds to originate commercial, residential mortgage, construction and consumer loans. 
We have grown our assets, deposits, and business organically and through acquisition by building on our lending products, expanding our deposit products and delivery capabilities, opening new branches, and hiring experienced bankers with existing customer relationships in our market areas.
A general discussion of the range of financial services we offer follows.
Lending Activities
We originate loans primarily secured by single and multi-family real estate, residential construction and commercial buildings. In addition, we make loans to small and mid-sized businesses, as well as to consumers for a variety of purposes. Our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated was comprised as follows:

(Dollars in thousands) | December 31,
Real estate: | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
Commercial real estate | $ | 1,228,402 | | | $ | 1,083,275 | | $ | 1,026,752 | $ | 861,540 | $ | 793,408

Commercial Real Estate Loans. We primarily originate commercial real estate loans and construction/land/land development loans that are generally secured by real estate located in our market areas. Our commercial mortgage loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortize over 25 to 30 years with balloon payments typically due at the end of five years. These loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary source of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower's liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions, industry specific trends and collateral. Commercial real estate loans have contributed interest income of $54.8 million and $46.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively, while construction/land/land development loans have contributed interest income of $19.6 million and $14.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Consumer Loans. Our consumer loan portfolio is primarily composed of secured and unsecured loans that we originate. The largest component of our consumer loan portfolio is for residential real estate purposes. We originate one-to-four family, owner occupied residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located in our primary market areas. The majority of our residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by owner occupied, single family residences. These loans are underwritten by giving consideration to the borrower's ability to pay, stability of employment or source of income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history and loan-to-value ratio. Consumer loans also include closed-end second mortgages, home equity lines of credit and our mortgage loans held for sale.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, inventory, equipment and capital expansion. The terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower's liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions, industry specific trends and collateral. Commercial and industrial loans also include mortgage warehouse loans which are extended to mortgage companies and secured by loan participations 
6

in mortgages that are typically sold within 20 to 30 days. Commercial and industrial loans have contributed interest income of $54.6 million and $43.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively, while mortgage warehouse loans have contributed interest income of $10.6 million and $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Credit Risks. The principal economic risk associated with each category of loans we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower and the ability of the borrower to repay the relevant loan. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and in the case of commercial borrowers, demand for the borrower's products and services, and other factors affecting the borrower's customers, suppliers and employees.
Risks associated with real estate loans also include fluctuations in the value of real estate, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates and, in the case of commercial borrowers, the quality of the borrower's management. Consumer loan repayments depend on the borrower's financial stability and are more likely than commercial loans to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships.
Lending Philosophy. Our lending philosophy is driven by our commitment to centralized underwriting for all loans, local market knowledge, long-term customer relationships and a conservative credit culture. To implement this philosophy we have established various levels of authority and review, including our Credit Risk Management Group. In each loan review, we emphasize cash flow and secondary and tertiary repayment sources, such as guarantors. We generally avoid lending to highly cyclical industries and typically avoid making certain types of loans that we consider to be higher risk.
Lending Policies. We have established common documentation and policies for each type of loan. We have also established a corporate loan committee with authority to approve loans up to the legal lending limit of Origin Bank. Credits of $5.0 million or greater are generally presented for review or approval prior to committing to the loan. The corporate loan committee meets weekly and on an ad hoc basis as needed.
Origin Bank's board of directors periodically reviews our lending policies and procedures. In addition, there are legal restrictions on the maximum amount of loans available for each lending relationship. As of December 31, 2018, Origin Bank's legal lending limit under the Louisiana Banking Law and the Regulation O of the Federal Reserve was $175.3 million for secured loans, $70.1 million for unsecured loans and $81.7 million for loans to insiders. As of December 31, 2018, we had established a general in-house lending limit ranging between $30.0 million and $35.0 million to any one borrower, based upon our internal risk rating of the relationship.
Deposits and Other Sources of Funds
An important aspect of our business franchise is the ability to gather deposits. As of December 31, 2018, we held $3.78 billion of total deposits and have grown deposits at a compound annual growth rate of 18.6% since December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2018, 81.8% of our total deposits were core deposits (defined as total deposits excluding time deposits greater than $250,000 and brokered deposits). We offer a wide range of deposit services, including checking, savings, money market accounts and time deposits. We obtain most of our deposits from individuals, small businesses and municipalities in our market areas. One area of focus has been to create a deposit-focused sales force of business development bankers who have extensive contacts and connections with targeted clients and centers of influence throughout our communities. We also have access to secondary sources of funding, including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and other borrowings.
Mortgage Banking
We are also engaged in the residential mortgage banking business, which primarily generates income from the sale of mortgage loans as well as the servicing of residential mortgage loans for others. We originate residential mortgage loans in our markets as a service to our existing customers and as a way to develop relationships with new customers, in order to support our core banking strategy. Revenue from our mortgage banking activities was $9.6 million, $15.8 million and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Insurance
We offer a wide variety of personal and commercial property and casualty insurance products through our wholly owned insurance agencies, Thomas & Farr and Reeves, Coon & Funderburg ("RCF").  With 30 years of growth in the insurance industry and more than 87 experienced professionals, our agencies have primary market locations across Louisiana, but also serve customers in Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas and other states across the U.S.  We also have a 38% interest in 
7

Lincoln Agency, LLC, a full-service insurance agency operating in North Louisiana. In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of RCF, solidifying our presence as one of the larger independent insurance agencies in North Louisiana. Insurance commission and fee income was $9.7 million, $7.2 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Other Banking Services
Given customer demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a wide range of products and services, including 24-hour Internet banking and voice response information, mobile applications, cash management, overdraft protection, direct deposit, safe deposit boxes, U.S. savings bonds and automatic account transfers.
Information Technology Systems
We continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems for our banking operations and treasury services to enhance our capabilities to offer new products and overall customer experience, to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions, and to increase controls and efficiencies in our back-office operations. We have obtained our core data processing platform from a nationally recognized bank processing vendor and we leverage the capabilities of a third-party service provider in developing our network design and architecture. We also actively manage our business continuity plan. The majority of our other systems, including electronic funds transfer and transaction processing, are operated in-house. Online banking services and other public-facing web services are performed using third-party service providers. We strive to follow all recommendations outlined by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and we perform regular tests of the adequacy of our contingency plans for key functions and systems.
Competition
The banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability will depend in large part on our ability to compete with other banks and non-bank financial service companies located in our markets for lending opportunities, deposit funds, financial products, bankers and acquisition targets.
We are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects of our business from banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit unions and other financial service providers, such as money market funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, asset-based non-bank lenders, insurance companies and certain other non-financial entities, including retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can.
We conduct business through 41 banking centers in our key market areas of North Louisiana, Central Mississippi, and Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston, Texas. Many other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions have offices in our primary market areas. These institutions include many of the largest banks operating in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, including various leading national banks. Our competitors often have greater resources, have broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer various services that we may not currently offer and may better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services and electronic technology than we do. To offset these competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation as having greater personal service, consistency, flexibility and the ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 761 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Corporate Information
We were organized as a business corporation in 1991 under the laws of the state of Louisiana. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 South Service Road East, Ruston, Louisiana 71270, and our telephone number is (318) 255-2222. Our website is www.origin.bank. We make available at this address, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our annual reports to stockholders, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These documents are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

Regulation and Supervision
General
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance will be affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("Bureau"), Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies, and any changes to such statutes, regulations and policies, can be significant and cannot be predicted.
The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system, facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy and promote fairness and transparency for financial products and services. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our subsidiaries establishes a comprehensive framework for their respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, the Bank's depositors and the public, rather than our stockholders or creditors. The description below summarizes certain elements of the bank regulatory framework applicable to us. This description is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries, and the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are described herein.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
Because we control Origin Bank, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and to supervision, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. The Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve's jurisdiction also extends to any company that we directly or indirectly control, such as any nonbank subsidiaries and other companies in which we own a controlling investment.
Financial Services Industry Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in 2010, broadly affects the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector, including provisions that, among other things:

• | apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that cover insured depository institutions to bank holding companies with total assets in excess of $1 billion;


• | establish the Bureau to, among other things, establish and implement rules and regulations applicable to all entities offering consumer financial products or services;


• | permanently increase FDIC deposit insurance maximum to $250,000 and broaden the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average total consolidated assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period, subject to certain adjustments;


• | eliminate the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year for the Deposit Insurance Fund, increase the minimum designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by September 30, 2020, and eliminate the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds;


• | permit banks to branch across state lines if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were part of a bank that was chartered by such state;


• | repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts;

9


• | require bank holding companies and banks to be "well capitalized" and "well managed" in order to acquire banks located outside of their home state and require any bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company to be "well capitalized" and "well managed;"


• | direct the Federal Reserve to establish limitations on interchange fees for debit cards under a "reasonable and proportional cost" per transaction standard;


• | prohibit a banking entity under a provision known as the Volcker Rule from engaging in proprietary trading or holding an ownership interest in or sponsoring a hedge fund or a private equity fund;


• | increase regulation of consumer protections regarding mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and prepayment consideration;


• | implement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by stockholders; and


• | increase the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine us and any nonbank subsidiaries.

In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("EGRRCPA") was signed into law. While EGRRCPA preserves the fundamental elements of the post-Dodd-Frank Act regulatory framework, it includes modifications that are intended to result in meaningful regulatory relief both from certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and from certain regulatory capital rules for smaller and certain regional banking organizations. Among other things, EGRRCPA exempts us from the Volcker Rule, allows us to avoid the risk-based capital rules if we maintain a specific "community bank leverage ratio," revises the capital treatment of certain commercial real estate loans, and amends certain Truth in Lending Act requirements for residential mortgage loans.
Even after the EGRRCPA modifications, the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with any new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Revised Rules on Regulatory Capital. The Federal Reserve monitors our capital adequacy at the holding company level by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios and considers our capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities. The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among financial institutions and their holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. The regulatory capital rules applicable to us were revised, effective January 1, 2015, under the Basel III regulatory capital framework. These rules include a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital. These enhancements are designed to both improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital required to be held by banking organizations, better equipping the U.S. banking system to cope with adverse economic conditions. Under these rules, we are required to satisfy four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets ratio, or "leverage ratio," of at least 4.0%, (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, or "common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio," of 4.5%, (3) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, or "Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio," of at least 6.0%, and (4) a total risk-based capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets ratio, or "total risk-based capital ratio," of at least 8.0%.
The capital rules also require bank holding companies to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital requirements composed solely of common equity Tier 1 capital to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. When fully phased in, the capital conservation buffer requirement will effectively require banking organizations to maintain regulatory risk-based capital ratios at least 2.5% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements set forth above. This buffer is intended to help to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is being phasing in over a four year period that began in January 2016. As of January 1, 2018, the phased-in portion of the capital conservation buffer was 1.875% of risk-weighted assets, and the buffer was fully phased in on January 1, 2019.
10

The revised regulatory capital rules implement stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of instruments, such as trust preferred securities (other than grandfathered trust preferred securities, such as those that we have issued), in Tier 1 capital going forward and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the rules require that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital.
These rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Under the rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights have been assigned to various categories of assets, including, certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual status, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions.
EGRRCPA exempts most banking organizations with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets from the risk-based and leverage capital rules and the capital conservation buffer if they maintain a "community bank leverage ratio" ("CBLR") of between 8% and 10%, the precise standard to be set by the federal banking agencies, and meet certain other requirements. On December 21, 2018, the agencies proposed a CBLR of 9%. We discuss the CBLR further below under "Bank Regulation – Capital Adequacy Requirements."
These capital requirements are minimum requirements. The Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements if warranted by our risk profile, economic conditions impacting our market or other circumstances particular to our organization. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive or restrictions on our operations and expansionary activities.
Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. Federal banking regulations require FDIC-insured banks that become undercapitalized to submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan of a bank controlled by a bank holding company will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary's compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a bank holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.
The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank in such a guarantee is limited to the lesser of 5% of the bank's assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized. The federal banking agencies have greater power in situations where a bank becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such a bank can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to divest the bank or other affiliates.
Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. We must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (1) acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company, (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or (3) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. In evaluating applications with respect to these transactions, the Federal Reserve is required to consider, among other things, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the financial condition, managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act), the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities, and the extent to which the proposed acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. The Federal Reserve can deny an application based on the above criteria or other considerations. In addition, as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, the Federal Reserve can impose conditions on the acquirer or the business to be acquired, which may not be acceptable or, if acceptable, may reduce the benefit of a proposed acquisition.
Control Acquisitions. Subject to various exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval or non-objection prior to any person or company acquiring "control" of a bank holding company. Although "control" is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment, control under the Bank Holding Company Act is conclusively presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 25% of more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company, controls the election of a majority of the board of directors, or able to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the company. 
11

Control of a bank holding company is rebuttably presumed to exist under the Change in Bank Control Act if the acquiring person or entity will own 10% or more of any class of voting securities immediately following the transaction and either no other person will hold a greater percentage of that class of voting securities after the acquisition or the bank holding company has publicly registered securities.
Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends; Source of Strength. As a financial holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve has issued a supervisory letter that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless: (1) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company; and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet, and is not in danger of failing to meet, minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to comply with the supervisory letter could result in a supervisory finding that the bank holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may also be limited if we must maintain the capital conservation buffer under the regulatory capital rules. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. The Federal Reserve may further restrict the payment of dividends by engaging in supervisory action to restrict dividends or by requiring us to maintain a higher level of capital then would otherwise be required under the Basel III minimum capital requirements.
Under longstanding Federal Reserve policy, which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, Origin Bank. This support may be required at times when we may not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans that we make to Origin Bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of Origin Bank. As discussed above, in certain circumstances, we could also be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of Origin Bank, if it became undercapitalized for purposes of the Federal Reserve's prompt corrective action regulations. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of Origin Bank under a capital restoration plan would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Scope of Permissible Activities. In general, the Bank Holding Company Act limits the activities permissible for bank holding companies to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incident thereto. Permissible activities for a bank holding company include, among others, operating a mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing investment and financial advice; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing personal property on a full-payout, nonoperating basis; and providing certain stock brokerage services. A bank holding company may also make an investment of up to 5% of any class of voting securities of any company that is otherwise a non-controlling investment.
A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company, as we have done, it may engage in activities that are (1) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (2) complementary to a financial activity and which do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally. These activities include securities dealing, underwriting and market making, insurance underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments. Expanded financial activities of financial holding companies generally will be regulated according to the type of such financial activity: banking activities by banking regulators, securities activities by securities regulators and insurance activities by insurance regulators. A bank holding company may elect to be treated as a financial holding company if it is "well capitalized" and "well managed" and if each of its depository institution subsidiaries is "well capitalized" and "well managed," and has received a rating of not less than Satisfactory on each such institution's most recent examinations under the Community Reinvestment Act. We have made a financial holding company election and currently engage in our insurance agency activities through the broader authority available to financial holding companies.
If we fail to continue to meet any of the requirements for financial holding company status, we may be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements within a certain period of time or lose our financial holding company designation, which could also result in a requirement to divest of any businesses for which a financial holding company election was required. In addition, the Federal Reserve may place limitations on our ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies during any period of noncompliance.

Volcker Rule. Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, commonly known as the "Volcker Rule," has generally prohibited insured depository institutions and their affiliates from sponsoring or acquiring an ownership interest in certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also places restrictions on proprietary trading. EGRRCPA exempts insured depository institutions with $10 billion or less in total consolidated assets from the Volcker Rule, and the Federal Reserve has effectively extended the exemption to bank holding companies.
Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. For example, the Federal Reserve's Regulation Y generally requires a bank holding company to provide the Federal Reserve with prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10.0% or more of the bank holding company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. In certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices, result in breaches of fiduciary duty or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties or impose enforcement action for such activities.
Bank Regulation
Origin Bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Louisiana and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. In addition, its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law. As a result, Origin Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve. As an insured depository institution, the bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC, although the Federal Reserve is the Bank's primary federal regulator. Finally, Origin Bank is also subject to secondary oversight by state banking authorities in other states in which it maintains banking offices. The bank regulatory agencies have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations. These requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of Origin Bank.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Federal Reserve and Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions monitor the capital adequacy of Origin Bank by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios similar to those applied at the holding company level. These agencies consider the bank's capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the bank and the banking system. Under the revised capital rules which became effective on January 1, 2015, Origin Bank is required to maintain four minimum capital standards: (1) a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%, (2) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, (3) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, and (4) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%. The capital rules also require FDIC-insured banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital requirements to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer must be composed solely of common equity Tier 1 capital. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer requirement will effectively require banking organizations to maintain regulatory risk-based capital ratios at least 2.5% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements.
Banks (and bank holding companies) with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets may be exempt from the risk-based and leverage capital requirements as well as the capital conservation buffer if the federal banking agencies finalize a rule on the CBLR and if the banks meet the requirements of the rule. EGRRCPA required the agencies to establish this ratio within a range of 8% to 10%. The agencies proposed a rule with a 9% CBLR that would be available to banking firms under the $10 billion threshold provided that certain assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items were below certain ceilings.
These capital requirements are minimum requirements. The Federal Reserve or Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions may also set higher capital requirements if warranted by the risk profile of Origin Bank, economic conditions impacting its markets or other circumstances particular to the bank. For example, Federal Reserve guidance provides that higher capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve's prompt corrective action regulations discussed below may, in effect, increase the minimum regulatory capital ratios for banking organizations. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject Origin Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, restrictions on business activities and other measures under the Federal Reserve's prompt corrective action regulations.
13

Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies. The federal banking regulators are required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to capital-deficient banks that are FDIC-insured. For this purpose, a bank is placed in one of the following five capital tiers: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." The bank's capital tier depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.
To be well capitalized, a bank must have a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At December 31, 2018, Origin Bank met the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework currently in effect. The pending CBLR proposal would treat a bank that met its requirements as well capitalized without reference to any of the current ratios.
As a bank's capital decreases, the enforcement authority of its regulators becomes more severe. Banks that are adequately, but not well, capitalized may not accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on its deposits. The Federal Reserve's prompt corrective action regulations also generally prohibit a bank from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized banks are also subject to growth limitations, may not accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The Federal Reserve may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank's capital. Significantly undercapitalized banks may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient shares or obligations to become adequately capitalized, limitations on asset growth, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIC must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The capital classification of a bank also affects the bank's ability to engage in certain activities and the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank.
Bank Mergers. Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, known as the "Bank Merger Act," requires the written approval of a bank's primary federal regulator before the bank may (1) acquire through merger or consolidation, (2) purchase or otherwise acquire the assets of, or (3) assume the deposit liabilities of, another bank. The Bank Merger Act prohibits the reviewing agency from approving any proposed merger transaction that would result in a monopoly, or would further a combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. Similarly, the Bank Merger Act prohibits the reviewing agency from approving a proposed merger transaction the effect of which in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade. An exception may be made in the case of a merger transaction the effect of which would be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, or otherwise restrain trade, if the reviewing agency finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.
In every proposed merger transaction, the reviewing agency must also consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of the community to be served, and the effectiveness of each insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combating money-laundering activities.
Branching. Under Louisiana law, Origin Bank is permitted to establish additional branch offices within Louisiana, subject to the approval of the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank may also establish additional branch offices outside of Louisiana, subject to prior regulatory approval, so long as the laws of the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered in that state to establish a branch. Any new branch, whether located inside or outside of Louisiana, must also be approved by the Federal Reserve, as the Bank's primary federal regulator. Origin Bank may also establish offices in other states by merging with banks or by purchasing branches of other banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Federal law strictly limits the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and Federal Reserve's Regulation W, impose quantitative limits, qualitative standards and collateral requirements on certain transactions by a bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B (1) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the bank's capital stock and surplus, and limit the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% 
14

of its capital stock and surplus, and (2) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans to an affiliate, the purchase of assets from an affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate, and several other types of transactions.
The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization, including an expansion of what types of transactions are covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be satisfied.
Federal law also limits a bank's authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank's capital. Loans to senior executive officers of a bank are subject to additional restrictions. Insiders may be subject to enforcement actions for accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions.
Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends. Origin Bank is subject to certain restrictions on dividends under federal and state laws, regulations and policies. In general, Origin Bank may pay dividends to us without the approval of the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions so long as the amount of the dividend does not exceed the bank's net profits earned during the current year combined with its retained net profits of the immediately preceding year. The bank is required to obtain the approval of the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions for any amount in excess of this threshold. In addition, under federal law, Origin Bank may not pay any dividend to us if it is undercapitalized or the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. The Federal Reserve may further restrict the payment of dividends by requiring the bank to maintain a higher level of capital than would otherwise be required to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Under the capital rules (and before the establishment of the CBLR), the failure to maintain an adequate capital conservation buffer, as discussed above, may also result in dividend restrictions. Moreover, if, in the opinion of the Federal Reserve, Origin Bank is engaged in an unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), the Federal Reserve may require, generally after notice and hearing, the bank to cease such practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe banking practice. The Federal Reserve has also issued guidance providing that a bank generally should pay dividends only when (1) the bank's net income available to common stockholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.
Incentive Compensation Guidance. The federal banking agencies have issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk management, control and governance processes. The incentive compensation guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (1) balanced risk- taking incentives, (2) compatibility with effective controls and risk management and (3) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization's supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization's federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization's incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, the capital conservation buffer described above would limit discretionary bonus payments to bank executives if the institution's regulatory capital ratios failed to exceed certain thresholds. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators' policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and evolve. The agencies (together with certain other federal agencies) proposed a regulation in 2016 on incentive compensation (as required by the Dodd-Frank Act) but have not finalized it.
Deposit Insurance Assessments. FDIC-insured banks are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. The amount of the assessment is based on the size of the bank's assessment base, which is equal to its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity, and its risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. The FDIC has revised its methodology for determining assessments from time to time. The current methodology, which has been in place since the third quarter of 2016, has a range of assessment rates from three basis points to 30 basis points on insured 
15

deposits. All insured depository institutions with the exception of large and complex banking organizations are assigned to one of three risk categories based on their composite CAMELS ratings. Each of the three risk categories has a range of rates, and the rate for a particular institution is determined based on seven financial ratios and the weighted average of its component CAMELS ratings. The FDIC may adjust assessment rates downward as the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund exceeds 2.0% and higher thresholds. The FDIC can also impose special assessments in certain instances. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines to increase assessment rates, Origin Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums. In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature between now and 2019.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and the related regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire assessment area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of such banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank's CRA performance record when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The CRA requires federal banking agencies to make public their ratings of banks' performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company transaction, the CRA performance record of the subsidiary banks of the bank holding companies involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. In addition, a financial holding company may face limitations on activities and acquisitions if its subsidiary depository institutions do not have a least a Satisfactory rating. Origin Bank received a Satisfactory rating in its most recent CRA examination.
Financial Modernization. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, banks may establish financial subsidiaries to engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting as principal, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development, real estate investment, annuity issuance and merchant banking activities. To do so, a bank must be well capitalized, well managed and have a CRA rating from its primary federal regulator of Satisfactory or better. Subsidiary banks of financial holding companies or banks with financial subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions. Such actions or restrictions could include divestiture of the financial subsidiary or subsidiaries. In addition, a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a CRA rating of Satisfactory of better.
Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking regulatory agencies have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100.0% or more of total capital or (2) total commercial real estate loans represent 300.0% or more of the bank's total capital and the outstanding balance of the bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, the bank will be subject to further regulatory scrutiny with respect to its risk management practices for commercial real estate lending. At December 31, 2017, Origin Bank's total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represented less than 100% of the bank's total capital, and its total commercial real estate loans represented less than 300% of the bank's total capital.
Consumer Laws and Regulations. Origin Bank is subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with the bank. These laws include, among others, laws regarding unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices, state usury laws and federal consumer protection statutes. These federal laws include the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Procedures Act of 1974, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among others. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those enacted under federal law. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans and conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Bureau, which has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The Bureau has authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, guidance, interpretations 
16

and policy statements, conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions with regard to consumer financial products and services. In general, banks with assets of $10 billion or less, such as Origin Bank, will continue to be examined for consumer compliance, and subject to enforcement actions, by their primary federal regulator, in our case the Federal Reserve. However, the Bureau may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a "sampling basis" and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary federal regulators. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the Bureau, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain consumer protection rules adopted by the Bureau against certain institutions.
Mortgage Lending Rules. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Bureau to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower's ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless they make a "reasonable and good faith determination" that the consumer has a "reasonable ability" to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a presumption or rebuttable presumption of compliance for loans that are "qualified mortgages." The Bureau has also issued regulations that, among other things, specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for income verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan's monthly payments. These regulations extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower's income and assets to include a requirement to verify all information that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also define "qualified mortgages" based on adherence to certain underwriting standards - for example, a borrower's debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43.0% - and certain restrictions on loan terms. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and the terms include a wide array of payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan. Certain loans, including interest-only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages. Also, the Dodd-Frank Act and the Bureau's final rule on loan originator compensation prohibit certain compensation payments to loan originators and the steering of consumers to loans not in their interest, particularly if the loans will result in greater compensation for a loan originator. The Dodd-Frank Act and the Bureau's implementing regulations also impose additional disclosure requirements with respect to the origination and sale of residential mortgages. EGRRCPA modifies certain of these requirements by, among other things, creating a safe harbor from the ability-to-repay standards for certain mortgage loans made by a bank with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets.
Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC. The Bank Secrecy Act requires federal savings associations and other financial institutions to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal requirements for an insured depository institution include (i) establishment of an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) establishment of a "know your customer" program involving due diligence to confirm the identity of persons seeking to open accounts and to deny accounts to those persons unable to demonstrate their identities; (iii) the filing of currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of cash; (iv) additional precautions for accounts sought and managed for non-U.S. persons; and (v) verification and certification of money laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. For many of these tasks a bank must keep records to be made available to its primary federal regulator. Anti- money laundering rules and policies are developed by a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, but compliance by individual institutions is overseen by its primary federal regulator, in the Bank's case, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") administers laws and Executive Orders that prohibit U.S. entities from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited parties. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction, account or wire transfer relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution's compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for bank mergers and acquisitions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and comply with OFAC sanctions, or to comply with relevant laws and regulations, could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution.
17

Privacy. Federal law and regulations limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. In addition to applicable federal privacy regulations, Origin Bank is subject to certain state privacy laws.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. Origin Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which is one of the 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks composing the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The Federal Home Loan Banks make loans to their member banks in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the boards of directors of each regional Federal Home Loan Bank. Any advances from a Federal Home Loan Bank must be secured by specified types of collateral, and all long-term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Origin Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas to Origin Bank are secured by a portion of the respective mortgage loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas held by Origin Bank.
Enforcement Powers. The bank regulatory agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance and impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements, breaches of fiduciary duty or the maintenance of unsafe and unsound conditions or practices could subject us or our subsidiaries, including Origin Bank, as well as their respective officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties.
FDIC Conservatorship or Receivership. The bank regulatory agencies may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a bank (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the bank is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by U.S. fiscal policy and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the "discount window," open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks' deposits and certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and assets of foreign branches. These policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies or the effect of these policies on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects.
Impact of Current Laws and Regulations
The cumulative effect of these laws and regulations, while providing certain benefits, adds significantly to the cost of our operations and thus has a negative impact on our profitability. There has also been a notable expansion in recent years of financial service providers that are not subject to the examination, oversight, and other rules and regulations to which we are subject. Those providers, because they are not so highly regulated, may have a competitive advantage over us and may continue to draw large amounts of funds away from traditional banking institutions, with a continuing adverse effect on the banking industry in general.
Future Legislation and Regulatory Reform In light of current conditions and the market outlook for continuing weak economic conditions, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures. New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive 
18

relationships of financial institutions operating in the United States. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Future legislation, regulation and policies, and the effects of that legislation and regulation and those policies, may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. Such legislation, regulation and policies have had a significant effect on the operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so.
