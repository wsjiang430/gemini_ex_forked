ITEM 1. Business
In this annual report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise indicates, "B&W," "we," "us," the "Company" and "our" mean Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a leading technology-based provider of advanced steam production from fossil and renewable sources for power generation and other industrial and municipal applications, as well as related environmental equipment and aftermarket parts and services. We specialize in technology and engineering for power generation and various other industries, including the procurement, erection and specialty manufacturing of related equipment, and services, including: 

• | high-pressure equipment for energy conversion, such as boilers fueled by coal, oil, bitumen, natural gas, and renewables including municipal solid waste and biomass fuels;


• | environmental control systems for both power generation and industrial applications to incinerate, filter, capture, recover and/or purify air, liquid and vapor-phase effluents from a variety of power generation and specialty manufacturing processes;


• | aftermarket support for the global installed base of operating plants with a wide variety of products and technical services including replacement parts, retrofit and upgrade capabilities, field engineering, construction, inspection, operations and maintenance, condition assessment and other technical support;


• | custom-engineered ash handling equipment, systems and replacement parts;


• | custom-engineered, comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions for steam applications; and


• | engineered-to-order services, products and systems for energy conversion worldwide and related auxiliary equipment, such as burners, pulverizers, soot blowers and ash and material handling systems.

Our overall activity depends significantly on the capital expenditures and operations and maintenance expenditures of global electric power generating companies, other steam-using industries and industrial facilities with environmental compliance needs. Several factors influence these expenditures, including: 

• | prices for electricity, along with the cost of production and distribution including the cost of fuel within the United States or internationally;


• | demand for electricity and other end products of steam-generating facilities;


• | requirements for environmental improvements;


• | expectation of future requirements to further limit or reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions in the United States and internationally;


• | environmental policies which include waste-to-energy or biomass as options to meet legislative requirements and clean energy portfolio standards;


• | level of capacity utilization at operating power plants and other industrial uses of steam production;


• | requirements for maintenance and upkeep at operating power plants to combat the accumulated effects of usage;


• | overall strength of the industrial industry; and


• | ability of electric power generating companies and other steam users to raise capital.

Customer demand is heavily affected by the variations in our customers' business cycles and by the overall economies and energy, environmental and noise abatement needs of the countries in which they operate. 
On June 8, 2015, the board of directors of The Babcock & Wilcox Company (now known as BWX Technologies, Inc.) ("BWXT" or the "former Parent") approved the spin-off of B&W through the distribution of shares of B&W common stock to holders of BWXT common stock. The distribution of B&W common stock was made on June 30, 2015 and consisted of one share of B&W common stock for every two shares of BWXT common stock to holders of BWXT common stock as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the record date, June 18, 2015. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares of B&W common stock. On June 30, 2015, B&W became a separate publicly traded company, and BWXT did not retain any ownership interest in B&W. We filed our Form 10 describing the spin-off with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on June 16, 2015.

Going Concern Considerations
We face liquidity challenges from losses recognized on our six European Vølund loss contracts described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, which caused us to be out of compliance with certain financial covenants and resulted in events of default in the agreements governing certain of our debt at each of December 31, 2017, March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018. Our liquidity is provided under a credit agreement dated May 11, 2015, as amended, with a syndicate of lenders ("Amended Credit Agreement") that governs a revolving credit facility ("U.S. Revolving Credit Facility") and our last out term loan facility ("Last Out Term Loans"). The Amended Credit Agreement is described in more detail in Note 19 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. We obtained waivers to the Amended Credit Agreement that temporarily waived, prevented or resolved these defaults as described in Note 19 and Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. The most recent waiver extends through April 5, 2019.
To address our liquidity needs and the going concern uncertainty, we:

• | raised gross proceeds of $248.4 million on April 30, 2018 through the rights offering as described in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 (the "2018 Rights Offering");


• | repaid on May 4, 2018 the Second Lien Term Loan Facility described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 that had been in default beginning March 1, 2018;


• | completed the sale of our MEGTEC and Universal businesses on October 5, 2018, for $130 million, subject to adjustment, resulting in receipt of $112.0 million in cash, net of $22.5 million in cash sold with the businesses, and $7.7 million that was deposited in escrow pending final settlement of working capital and other customary matters;


• | completed the sale of Palm Beach Resource Recovery Corporation ("PBRRC"), a subsidiary that held two operations and maintenance contracts for waste-to-energy facilities in West Palm Beach, Florida, on September 17, 2018 for $45 million subject to adjustment, resulting in receipt of $38.9 million in cash and $4.9 million, which was deposited in escrow pending final settlement of working capital and other customary matters;


• | sold our equity method investments in Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Company, Ltd. ("BWBC"), a joint venture in China, and Thermax Babcock & Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited ("TBWES"), a joint venture in India, and settled related contractual claims, resulting in proceeds of $21.1 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $15.0 million in the third quarter of 2018, respectively;


• | sold another non-core business for $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2018;


• | initiated restructuring actions and other additional cost reductions since the second quarter of 2018 that are designed to save approximately $84 million annually;


• | received $30 million in net proceeds from Tranche A-1 of Last Out Term Loans, described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, from B. Riley FBR, Inc., a related party, in September and October 2018 (Tranche A-1 was assigned to Vintage Capital Management LLC, another related party, on November 19, 2018);


• | received $10.0 million in net proceeds from Tranche A-2 of the Last Out Term Loans, described in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, from B. Riley Financial, Inc., a related party on March 20, 2019;


• | reduced uncertainty and provided better visibility into our future liquidity requirements by turning over four of the six European Vølund loss contracts to the customers and negotiating settlement of the remaining two loss contracts in the first quarter of 2019 as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8; and


• | entered into several amendments and waivers to avoid default and improve our liquidity under the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement as described in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, the most recent of which extends through April 5, 2019, unless earlier terminated, and waives our compliance with a number of covenants and events of default under, the Amended Credit Agreement.

Management believes it is taking all prudent actions to address the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, but we cannot assert that it is probable that our plans will fully mitigate the liquidity challenges we face. We are currently dependent upon the waivers granted in our most recent limited waiver to maintain our current compliance with the covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement, and since March 20, 2019, we have also been nearly fully drawn on the U.S. Revolving Credit Facility, such that only minimal additional amounts were available for borrowings or letters of credit.
5

Based on our forecasts, we will require additional amendments to or waivers under the Amended Credit Agreement and additional financing to fund working capital and the settlements of two of our six European Vølund loss contracts described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 prior to April 5, 2019 to continue as a going concern. We are currently in active discussions with the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement (including certain of our related parties) for additional financing, a waiver of our compliance with covenants in and events of default under the Amended Credit Agreement, a reduction of the minimum liquidity requirements that we must maintain, a reset of future financial covenant ratios and amendments to other covenant requirements in order to allow us to continue to operate as a going concern. Our current discussions have focused around the extension of  additional Last Out Term Loans, primarily from related parties, in an amount necessary to fund the settlement of the European Vølund loss contracts and provide liquidity for our operations. In connection with these loans, we have also discussed seeking shareholder approval for a reverse stock split and various other matters that could result in substantial dilution to our shareholders not participating in this financing, such as a rights offering to repay a portion of these additional Last Out Term Loans, the exchange of a portion of our existing Last Out Term Loans for shares of common stock and the issuance of warrants with a de minimis strike price to lenders participating in these additional Last Out Term Loans or other parties. We also discussed whether, as part of any financing transaction, we would provide director nomination rights over some or even a substantial majority of our board of directors to two of the related parties involved in these financing efforts or whether we would add an event of default if we fail to refinance the U.S. Revolving Credit Facility within twelve months following the filing of this annual report. These discussions have not yet resulted, and may never result, in a binding commitment by our lenders. There can be no assurance that our lenders or any other person will commit to provide additional financing consistent with these discussions or at all. If we are able to obtain additional financing, it may be on terms substantially different from our current discussions described above, and may require additional or different commitments by us with regard to other actions we will or will not take. If we fail to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms or otherwise obtain short-term capital and continuing waivers with approval from our existing lenders, we may be unable to continue operation as a going concern.
In addition to the discussions regarding additional financing described above, we continue to evaluate further dispositions, opportunities for additional cost savings and opportunities for insurance recoveries and other claims where appropriate and available.
NYSE Continued Listing Status
On November 27, 2018, we received written notification (the "NYSE Notice"), from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), that we were not in compliance with an NYSE continued listing standard in Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of our common stock fell below $1.00 over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. We informed the NYSE that we intend to seek to cure the price condition by executing our strategic plan, which is expected to result in improved operational and financial performance that we expect will ultimately lead to a recovery of our common stock price. We can regain compliance with the minimum per share average closing price standard at any time during the six-month cure period if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period, we have (i) a closing share price of at least $1.00 and (ii) an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. We informed the NYSE that we are also prepared to consider a reverse stock split to cure the deficiency, should such action be necessary, subject to approval of our shareholders, at our next annual meeting. Our common stock could also be delisted if our average market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period is less than $15.0 million, in which case we would not have an opportunity to cure the deficiency, our common stock would be suspended from trading on the NYSE immediately, and the NYSE would begin the process to delist our common stock, subject to our right to appeal under NYSE rules. We cannot assure you that any appeal we undertake in these or other circumstances will be successful. While we are considering various options, it may take a significant effort to cure this deficiency and regain compliance with this continued listing standard, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to cure this deficiency or if we will cease to comply with another NYSE continued listing standard.
Business Segments
Our operations are assessed based on three reportable segments, Babcock & Wilcox, Vølund & Other Renewable and SPIG (formerly, the Power, Renewable and Industrial segments, respectively).
Babcock & Wilcox segment
Our Babcock & Wilcox segment (formerly the Power segment) focuses on the supply of, and aftermarket services for, steam-generating, environmental, and auxiliary equipment for power generation and other industrial applications, which includes a 
6

comprehensive mix of new build, OEM and aftermarket products and services to support peak efficiency and availability of steam generating and associated environmental and auxiliary equipment, serving large steam generating utility and industrial customers globally. 
The Babcock & Wilcox segment provides a full suite of product and service offerings including engineering, procurement, specialty manufacturing, construction and commissioning of new and retrofit utility boilers and industrial boilers fired with coal and natural gas. Our boiler products include advanced supercritical boilers, subcritical boilers, fluidized bed boilers, chemical recovery boilers, industrial power boilers, package boilers, heat recovery steam generators and waste heat boilers.
Our environmental systems offerings include air pollution control products and related equipment for the treatment of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate, mercury, acid gases and other hazardous air emissions. These include wet and dry flue gas desulfurization systems, catalytic and non-catalytic nitrogen oxides reduction systems, low nitrogen oxides burners and overfire air systems, fabric filter baghouses, wet and dry electrostatic precipitators, mercury control systems and dry sorbent injection for acid gas mitigation.
Our aftermarket products and services include replacement parts, field technical services, retrofit and upgrades, fuel switching and repowering contracts, construction and maintenance services, start-up and commissioning, training programs and plant operations and maintenance for our full complement of boiler, environmental and auxiliary equipment. Our auxiliary equipment includes boiler cleaning equipment and material handling equipment. We provide aftermarket parts and services both for our own installed base as well as for competitors' equipment.
The segment also receives license fees and royalty payments through licensing agreements of our proprietary technologies.
While opportunities to increase revenues in the segment are limited, we are striving to grow margins by:

• | maintaining our strong service presence in support of our installed fleet of steam generation equipment and expanding support of others' OEM equipment;


• | selectively bidding contracts in emerging international markets needing state-of-the-art technology for fossil power generation and environmental systems;


• | growing sales of industrial steam generation products in the petrochemical and pulp & paper markets, such as heat recovery, environmental control systems, natural gas and oil-fired package boilers, due in part to lower fuel prices; and


• | reducing costs through a focus on operational efficiencies.

Previously, our operations in the Babcock & Wilcox segment included joint ventures that were accounted for using the equity method. In 2018, we sold our interest in our Chinese joint venture, Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Company, Ltd. ("BWBC"), and our interest in our Indian joint venture, Thermax Babcock & Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited. In 2016, we sold all of our interest in our former Australian joint venture, Halley & Mellowes Pty. Ltd. ("HMA"). As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any remaining investments in equity method investees. See further discussion of these former operations and the sale transactions in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this annual report.
Vølund & Other Renewable segment
Our Vølund & Other Renewable segment (formerly the Renewable segment) provides steam-generating systems, environmental and auxiliary equipment for the waste-to-energy and biomass power generation industries, and plant operations and maintenance services for our full complement of systems and equipment. We deliver these products and services to a large base of customers primarily in Europe through our extensive network of technical support personnel and global sourcing capabilities. Our customers consist of traditional, renewable and carbon neutral power utility companies that require steam generation and environmental control technologies to enable beneficial use of municipal waste and biomass. This segment's activity is dependent on the demand for electricity and reduced landfill use, and ultimately the capacity utilization and associated operations and maintenance expenditures of waste-to-energy power generating companies and other industries that use steam to generate energy.
In 2017, we redefined our approach to bidding on and executing renewable energy contracts. Under our new model, we are focusing on engineering and supplying our core waste-to-energy and renewable energy technologies - steam generation, combustion grate, environmental equipment, material handling, and cooling condensers - while partnering with other firms to execute the balance of plant and civil construction scope on contracts we pursue. We believe the new market approach is 
7

better aligned with our core competencies and risk-profile as a supplier of engineered equipment and technologies and aftermarket services.
Globally, efforts to reduce the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels may create opportunities for us as existing generating capacity is replaced with cleaner technologies. We expect backlog growth in the future, primarily from renewable waste-to-energy contracts, as we continue to see numerous opportunities around the globe, although the rate of this growth is dependent on many external factors. 
Our Vølund & Other Renewable segment also includes Loibl, a global supplier and manufacturer of material solutions, from single belt conveyors to complex bulk material handling systems. Loibl serves a wide range of industrial and utility customers.
On September 17, 2018, we sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Palm Beach Resource Recovery Corporation ("PBRRC"), a subsidiary that held two operations and maintenance contracts for waste-to-energy facilities in West Palm Beach, Florida. See further discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this annual report.
SPIG segment
At December 31, 2018, our SPIG segment was formerly part of the Industrial segment and is comprised of our SPIG business. We acquired SPIG S.p.A. ("SPIG") on July 1, 2016. SPIG provides custom-engineered cooling systems, services and aftermarket products. SPIG’s product offerings include air-cooled (dry) cooling systems, mechanical draft wet cooling towers and natural draft wet cooling hyperbolic towers. SPIG also provides end-to-end aftermarket services, including spare parts, upgrades and revamping of existing installations and remote monitoring. SPIG's comprehensive dry and wet cooling solutions and aftermarket products and services are primarily provided to the power generation industry, including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, and downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets in the Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. SPIG's activity is dependent primarily on global energy demand from utilities and other industrial plants, regulatory requirements, water scarcity and energy efficiency needs.
We see opportunities for growth in revenues from core products and geographies in the SPIG segment relating to a variety of factors. Our new equipment customers make purchases as part of major capacity expansions, to replace existing equipment, or in response to regulatory initiatives. Additionally, our significant installed base provides a consistent and recurring aftermarket stream of parts, retrofits and services.
On October 5, 2018, we sold all of the capital stock of our MEGTEC and Universal businesses to Dürr Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Dürr AG, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement executed on June 5, 2018. The MEGTEC and Universal businesses are classified as discontinued operations because the disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations; they were previously included in our Industrial segment, which has been renamed the SPIG segment because SPIG is the remaining business of the former Industrial segment. See further discussion in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this annual report.
Contracts
We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price, cost-plus, target price cost incentive, cost-reimbursable or some combination of these methods. Contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, plant or equipment availability, efficiency, safety record and reputation.
Fixed-price contracts are for a fixed selling price to cover all costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work.
We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such changes, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices. In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation without cause, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to 
8

deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
From time to time, we partner with other companies to better meet the needs of our customers, which can result in project-related joint venture entities or other contractual arrangements. While we carefully select our partners in these arrangements, they can subject us to risks that we may not be able to fully control and may include joint and several liability. An example of this includes BWL Energy Ltd., which was formed to complete the construction of a waste wood fired boiler contract in the United Kingdom (the fifth European Vølund loss contract described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8). This joint venture combined our expertise in the waste-to-energy power plant design, engineering, procurement and construction with our partner's civil construction capability to provide a full turnkey product to our customer. However, our partner in BWL Energy Ltd filed for administration (similar to bankruptcy in the U.S.) in late February 2018, and we were required to assume our partner's scope of work.
We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs over time using the cost-to-cost input method that uses costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Accordingly, we review contractual sales price and cost estimates regularly as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a contract, we would recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material. 
See further description of risks related to our contracting in Risks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business of our risk factors in Item 1A to this annual report.
Our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts, which may involve providing cash collateral or other contract security that we may not be able to provide. 
Other sales, such as parts and certain aftermarket service activities, are not in the form of long-term contracts, and we recognize revenues as goods are delivered and work is performed. See further discussion in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this annual report.
Foreign Operations
Our operations in Denmark provide comprehensive services to companies in the waste-to-energy and biomass energy sector of the power generation market, primarily in Europe. Our operations in Italy provide custom-engineered comprehensive wet and dry cooling solutions and aftermarket parts and services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. Our operations in Scotland and China primarily provide boiler cleaning technologies and systems (such as sootblowers), primarily to Europe and China, respectively. Our operations in Germany provide a variety of ash and material handling solutions, from completely dry bottom ash handling to fly ash and petroleum coke processing to customers worldwide. Our Canadian operations serve the Canadian industrial power, oil production and electric utility markets. We have manufacturing facilities in Mexico to serve global markets. We also own a manufacturing facility in China that produces tube bundles for our cooling solutions.
Historically, our joint ventures in China and India served the power generation needs of their local domestic and other utility markets, and both joint ventures participated as manufacturing partners on certain of our foreign contracts. In 2018, we sold our joint venture interests of BWBC and TWBES, located in China and India, respectively.
The functional currency of our foreign operating entities is not the United States dollar, and as a result, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
For additional information on the geographic distribution of our revenues, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 to this annual report.

Customers
We provide our products and services to a diverse customer base that includes utilities and other power producers located around the world. We have one customer, Southern Company, which accounted for $138.1 million or 13.0% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have no customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in the years ended December 31, 2017, or 2016.
Competition
With over 150 years of experience, we have supplied highly engineered energy and environmental equipment in over 90 countries. We have a competitive advantage in our experience and technical capability to reliably convert a wide range of fuels to steam. Our strong, installed base around the globe also yields competitive advantages, although our markets are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies specializing in power generation, environmental, and cooling systems and services. Each segment's primary competitors are summarized as follows:

Babcock & Wilcox segment | Vølund & Other Renewable segment | SPIG segment 
GE | CNIM Group | Hamon 
Babcock Power | Hitachi Zosen | Enexio 
Clyde Bergemann | Martin | Kelvion 
Enerfab | Keppel Seghers | Paharpur 
MH Power Systems | Valmet | Evapco 
AECom | Andritz | SPX Corporation

Across each of our segments, we also compete with a variety of engineering and construction companies related to installation of steam generating systems and environmental control equipment; specialized industrial equipment; and other suppliers of replacement parts, repair and alteration services and other services required to retrofit and maintain existing steam generating systems. The primary bases of competition are price, technical capabilities, quality, timeliness of performance, breadth of products and services and willingness to accept contract risks.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our operations use raw materials such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components and accessories for assembly, which are available from numerous sources. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials. Although shortages of some raw materials have existed from time to time, no serious shortage exists at the present time. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,000 employees worldwide. Of our hourly employees, approximately 600 are union-affiliated, covered by four union agreements related to active facilities in Mexico, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Two of our union agreements expire in 2019 and one expires in 2020, and we are actively negotiating one new agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees and unions to be in good standing. 
Patents and Licenses
We currently hold a large number of United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending. We have acquired patents and technology licenses and granted technology licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how, rather than patents and licenses, in the conduct of our various businesses. 
10

Research and Development Activities
Our research and development activities are related to improving our products through innovations to reduce the cost of our products to make them more competitive and through innovations to reduce performance risk of our products to better meet our and our customers' expectations. Research and development costs unrelated to specific contracts are expensed as incurred. 
Permits and Licenses
We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors. We are not aware of any material noncompliance and believe our operations and certifications are currently in compliance with all relevant permits, licenses and certifications.
Environmental
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"). CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year.
