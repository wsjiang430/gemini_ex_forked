Item 1. Business. 
Business Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage bioelectronic medicine company with a proprietary non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, or nVNS, therapy.  nVNS is a platform therapy that modulates neurotransmitters and immune function through its pharmacologic effects on both the peripheral and central nervous systems.  We are initially focused on neurology and rheumatology, and our therapy, gammaCore, is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or FDA, for use by adults for the following three neurology indications: the acute treatment of pain associated with each of migraine and episodic cluster headache (“eCH”); and the prevention of cluster headaches. In neurology, we are pursuing further label expansions to include the prevention of migraine, migraine in adolescents, and post-traumatic headache.  We are also engaging in clinical development for potential new labeling claims in rheumatology, with an initial focus on rheumatoid arthritis.  
 gammaCore is the first FDA-cleared, prescription-only non-invasive VNS therapy.  Historically, vagus nerve stimulation or VNS, required a highly invasive surgical procedure to permanently implant a costly medical device. These limitations prevented VNS from being used, other than for the most severe patients. Our lead product, gammaCore Sapphire, is a proprietary, simple-to-use handheld delivery system intended for multi-year use prescribed on a monthly basis, and is both rechargeable and reloadable via individualized radio-frequency identification, or RFID, cards. gammaCore Sapphire permits patients to self-administer discrete doses of nVNS on an as-needed basis for acute treatment, or at regular intervals for prevention therapy.  
 Non-invasive delivery of VNS or nVNS by our gammaCore Sapphire is enabled by a proprietary high-frequency burst waveform that safely and comfortably passes through the skin and stimulates targeted A-fibers in the vagus nerve. Multiple published studies suggest that VNS works through the modulation of neurotransmitters, and has a measurable pharmacologic effect similar to several classes of commonly prescribed medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and GABA analogues. Research also indicates that VNS, including gammaCore, moderates the inflammatory response producing a measurable reduction in inflammatory cytokine production. 
 In January 2018, the FDA cleared our gammaCore therapy for our lead indication: the acute treatment of migraine in adults.  Migraine is a debilitating primary headache condition that affects approximately 12% of the adult population.  Some reports suggest that up to 60% of migraine suffers are dissatisfied with, or have contraindications to, the current standard of care treatments for migraine, such as triptan medications. Published reports suggest that the total addressable market for the acute treatment of migraine in the United States in 2019 will be approximately $4 billion. In April 2017, the FDA cleared our gammaCore therapy for the acute treatment of cluster headache, or CH, and in December 2018, the FDA cleared our therapy for the prevention of CH.  CH is an extremely painful form of headache affecting approximately 350,000 people in the United States.  Prior to gammaCore, injectable sumatriptan was the only FDA-approved, commercially available acute CH treatment, and there was no FDA approved therapy for the prevention of CH.  According to a 2016 market research survey, 87% of respondents reported dissatisfaction with the then-available treatment options for managing CH.  We estimate the total addressable U.S. market for the acute treatment of these CH patients in 2019 is approximately $400 million. 
 The first three clearances of our gammaCore therapy were facilitated by the FDA’s creation of a new regulatory category: External Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Headache (21 CFR 882-5892).  Based on this category’s description, we anticipate additional label expansions will be possible through the pathway under Section 510(k) of the Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act, and are pursuing clinical programs to support label expansion filings for migraine prevention, migraine in adolescents, and the treatment of post-traumatic headache. 
 In July 2017, following our initial FDA clearance in CH, we began a year-long commercial registry, managed by four regional business managers in partnership with 40 of the top headache centers in the United States, to gather real-world experiences with gammaCore among CH patients, gain advocacy among 250 physicians, and to drive an initial 1,000 prescriptions into U.S. commercial payers.  By June 2018, when the registry program concluded, an additional 40 centers of excellence had requested inclusion in the program, and we hired an additional 10 territory business managers.  These efforts generated more than 5,000 prescriptions into commercial payers from more than 800 neurologists, including more than 3,300 prescriptions in the second quarter of 2018.  In July 2018, following the successful completion of our initial public offering, we expanded our direct sales force to 32 representatives, who initiated a proactive outreach to more than 6,400 leading headache physicians.  In 2018, approximately 15,000 gammaCore prescriptions were written by more than 1,800 prescribing physicians, over 1,000 of whom were defined as regular gammaCore prescribers based on the frequency of their prescriptions.  This included approximately 4,400 prescriptions in the third quarter of 2018, and approximately 5,800 in the fourth quarter of 2018.  This increasing prescription volume helped us engage with payers, and to execute agreements with commercial and government payers for coverage of more than 50 million lives in the United States.  
 2

As of January 2019, we have agreements or arrangements with commercial payers, one pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM and the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, that we estimate provide for reimbursement for gammaCore as either a pharmacy benefit or medical benefit for approximately 53 million lives in the United States.  Although there can be no assurance of success, our payer access team is negotiating contracts with several additional insurance plans and PBMs covering an additional approximately 90 million commercial lives, and in clinical review with plans covering an additional approximately 50 million lives.  
 With respect to the broader platform potential of nVNS, modulation of the peripheral immune system by nVNS provides mechanistic support for the study of gammaCore in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.  In partnership with academic centers in both Denmark and the United Kingdom, gammaCore has been studied in both rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s syndrome.  More particularly, early results from an open label pilot trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had failed traditional interventions have provided support for continued work.  Similarly, with respect to Sjögren’s syndrome, an open label pilot study was followed by a sham-controlled pilot trial, both of which have provided positive early results.  If the ongoing work produces similar results, it is expected that we will initiate a pivotal trial in rheumatoid arthritis in 2019 and in Sjögren’s syndrome in 2020.  
 The table below summarizes our areas of focus for gammaCore: 
 
Table 1:  Our Pipeline 
 


Background of VNS 
 The vagus nerve is the largest and most extensive cranial nerve, connecting the brainstem to nearly every organ in the chest and abdomen.  Modulating the firing rate of the fibers within the vagus nerve can trigger the release of neurotransmitters, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems, affecting how the brain and peripheral organs function. In the central nervous system, VNS activates areas of the brainstem that release norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA and other important biochemicals. The release of these substances, which have been the targets of numerous pharmaceutical agents, can be used to treat multiple conditions, including epilepsy, depression and headache. In the periphery, the release of neurotransmitters associated with vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to have multiple beneficial effects, including the reduction of systemic inflammatory cytokines. VNS is being studied for use in a number of inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, and Crohn’s disease. 
 Over the past two decades, the body of scientific evidence in support of VNS in multiple medical conditions has been growing. Prior to gammaCore, however, the cost and requirement for invasive surgery meant that VNS was only appropriate for the most refractory patients. With the clearance of gammaCore, this safe and effective therapy can now be noninvasively self-administered, at a fraction of the initial cost, exponentially expanding its accessibility for the potential treatment of multiple medical conditions.

Preclinical Evidence of gammaCore’s Activation of the Vagus Nerve 
 The development of gammaCore required a number of inventions that enable the comfortable passage of our proprietary therapeutic signal to specifically targeted fibers within the vagus nerve. Confirmation that gammaCore successfully activates the vagus nerve has been published by independent scientists and clinicians who have performed multiple lines of research.  These lines of research include:
  
• | electric field modeling to demonstrate that our therapy establishes the necessary charge gradients in the targeted nerve fibers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | electroencephalography experiments showing that gammaCore produces dose-dependent changes in EEG signals similar to those observed with VNS delivered using surgically implanted devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | both functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography that produced clear imaging data of gammaCore activating critical areas in the brainstem, including those associated with the release of the target neurotransmitters; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | multiple animal and human studies demonstrating modulation of the target neurotransmitters and inflammatory markers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Therapy Delivery Platform 
 Our gammaCore therapy is the first and only treatment that non-invasively activates the therapeutically relevant fibers in the cervical trunk of the vagus nerve, delivered in discrete two-minute doses, using proprietary signals that are capable of passing through skin while minimizing the activation of skin pain receptors. 
 Our therapy is prescription-only, and like medications delivered by metered-dose inhalers, patients self-administer discrete doses using a handheld unit. gammaCore Sapphire is a non-disposable, rechargeable and reloadable option for patients, with the therapy being dispensed through a prescription from a specialty pharmacy. After the initial prescription is filled, access to therapy is refilled monthly through the input of a unique, prescription-only authorization code.  This code is currently delivered in the form of an RFID card, dispensed by mail by our specialty pharmacy distribution partner. In the future this refill may be dispensed directly through the internet using Bluetooth technology.
 The prior iteration of the gammaCore delivery device was not reloadable and rechargeable, and was supplanted by the gammaCore Sapphire during the fourth quarter of 2018. While we do not intend to market the non-reloadable, disposable version of our gammaCore product in markets where the gammaCore Sapphire is launched, in select cases, we may continue to use the prior gammaCore product, such as in clinical studies where a rechargeable version is not necessary.
 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the competitive strengths of our company and our novel and proprietary self-administered bioelectronic therapy include: 
 
 
• | Innovative bioelectronic medicine approach. Our gammaCore therapy uses a proprietary electric signal to safely deliver bioelectronic medicine, which causes targeted pharmacologic-like changes in neurotransmitter expression and in the immune system, without systemic exposure to exogenous chemicals, in a manner that has been shown to have minimal side effects through clinical studies encompassing thousands of patients (several of which are more fully described herein).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our non-invasive therapy unlocks the long-held potential of VNS. VNS therapy can, for the first time, be delivered safely and comfortably through the skin using gammaCore. This eliminates the need for costly, invasive surgery that requires the implantation of an expensive medical device. VNS therapy is no longer reserved for the most refractory patients, and is now a first-line treatment option.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Commercializing our therapy through traditional pharmaceutical channels. Our monthly prescription model, made possible by our non-invasive delivery modality, empowers medical professionals to prescribe nVNS on a monthly basis through the same channel they would prescribe any other specialty medication. Our RFID refill card enables us to offer nVNS therapy on a monthly basis, at the price of a branded pharmaceutical, which is typical of a traditional drug reimbursement model managed by pharmacy benefit managers and other commercial payers. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, we have agreements with commercial payers and the Federal Supply Schedule (Veterans Administration and Department of Defense) that we estimate provide reimbursement of gammaCore for approximately 53 million lives. Although there can be no assurance of success, we continue discussions with additional payers and PBMs regarding up to an additional 90 million lives in the United States with a goal of securing reimbursement for an aggregate of 75 million lives in the United States by the beginning of the third quarter of 2019, and an aggregate of 100 million lives in the United States by the end of 2019. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly scalable and low investment manufacturing with digital refills. Our low manufacturing and assembly costs allow us to scale to meet demand with minimal additional investment. With the launch of the gammaCore Sapphire, which uses RFID cards for refills, our gross margins are expected to increase significantly. When the payers are in place, we have the capability to integrate our onboard Bluetooth technology with the payer systems to leverage a cloud-based refill delivery process, which we believe will enable greater efficiencies, further enhancing our gross margins.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for rapid label expansion in headache and regulatory approval in additional indications. The safety profile of gammaCore enabled us to utilize the de novo regulatory pathway through which the FDA established a new therapeutic category: External Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Headache (21 CFR 882-5892). Through the 510(k) pathway, we received clearance for our gammaCore therapy for the acute treatment of pain associated with migraine in adults in January 2018, and clearance for the prevention of cluster headaches in December 2018. We believe a similar regulatory pathway may be available to us for additional indications in headache, including the prevention of migraine, the expansion of our label to include adolescents, and the treatment of post-traumatic headaches. We also anticipate seeking regulatory authorization to commercialize our therapy in rheumatological conditions through similar pathways. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad intellectual property protection. Among our key issued patents, we have coverage on using our high-frequency burst signal for treating certain medical conditions until 2031, the low-pass filtering of that signal to ensure safe and comfortable transmission through the skin until 2031, the non-invasive treatment of headache conditions until 2029, and the remote network-enabled communication for the delivery of neuromodulation therapy for a broad range of medical conditions until 2033.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly experienced management team. Our management team includes a diverse group of executives with significant experience in senior positions in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, including positions at Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, Stryker and Zimmer Biomet. Members of our team have been involved in the launch and marketing of products including Motrin, Celebrex, and the migraine drugs Axert and Maxalt. Our team’s pharmaceutical experience in clinical development, sales, marketing and reimbursement, and its medical device experience in research, development and regulatory affairs, allow us to pursue our strategy and growth plans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to be a leader in bioelectronic medicine by using our proprietary non-invasive VNS platform therapy to deliver better patient outcomes. The key elements of our strategy include: 

• | Drive acceptance of our gammaCore products as a leading headache therapy. We are establishing gammaCore as a first-line treatment option for neurologists when treating CH patients, who have few alternative treatment options available to them. We are continuing to leverage this position as we expand into the broader headache market for acute migraine treatment. We are working towards gaining additional FDA-clearances in multiple headache indications including migraine prevention, post traumatic headache, and migraine in adolescents. Receipt of each of these FDA-clearances will provide us with greater access into the headache market. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive reimbursement of our therapy. We have been and are actively engaging with over 50 national and regional commercial insurance payers, as well as the Federal Supply Schedule in the United States, with the goal of securing reimbursement coverage. These efforts in 2018 culminated with the initiation of estimated coverage for approximately 53 million lives in the United States as of January 2019. With continuing payer discussions regarding up to an additional 90 million lives, we are seeking to expand the number of covered lives in the United States to an aggregate of 75 million by the beginning of the third quarter of 2019, and to an aggregate of 100 million by the end of 2019, although there can be no assurance of success. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Build a leading commercial presence. We have established a robust commercial capacity, including a specialty distribution channel with a patient-focused support service to quickly onboard patients and manage payer interactions. Following our initial public offering, in the third quarter of 2018 we expanded our direct sales force to 32 people who are targeting the 6,400 leading neurology specialists and headache centers that originate the substantial majority of new prescriptions for severe headache patients in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance our pipeline. In 2018, we initiated several studies, including an additional pivotal trial to support potential label expansion in migraine prevention. In partnership with academic colleagues in the United Kingdom and Denmark, we also completed our first pilot trial in rheumatology, including rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s syndrome. Over the next 24 months, we anticipate additional sponsored trials will be conducted in both neurology and rheumatology, including in migraine in adolescents (our ATOM trial) and rheumatoid arthritis.

Our Lead Indications in Headache 
 In January 2018, gammaCore was cleared by the FDA, through a 510(k) review, for commercial sale in the United States as an acute treatment for pain associated with migraine in adults. The predicate for this clearance was the FDA release we secured through the de novo review for the acute treatment of pain associated with episodic cluster headache in April 2017. 
 Migraine is the third most common disease in the world, and a debilitating condition characterized by severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head, often associated with nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine impacts more than 38 million people in the United States, disproportionately affecting women of childbearing years, with peak onset during the adolescent ages of 12 to 16. While migraine sufferers have a number of approved and available treatments, contraindications, side effects, and incomplete efficacy of these options continues to drive a high level of dissatisfaction with current therapies.
 Our FDA clearance for the acute treatment of migraine in adults is principally supported by our pivotal trial, PRESTO. The primary endpoint of PRESTO was pain-freedom at 120 minutes. While this trial did not reach statistical significance with respect to its primary endpoint, statistical significance was achieved for complete pain relief at 30 minutes (12.7%; p=0.01), and maintained at 60 minutes (21.0%; p=0.02), and under a repeated-measures analysis, through the full 120-minute period (30.4%; p=0.01).  We are currently building and aggregating the necessary data to support the FDA clearance of our label expansion for the prevention of migraine.
 Migraine
 The grant by FDA of our de novo submission resulted in a new Class II regulatory category: External Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Headache (21 CFR 882-5892). The establishment of this product category permits us to apply for label expansions through the 510(k) regulatory pathway utilizing our own product as the predicate.
Market Factors 
 Prevalence and Market Size. According to the World Health Organization, migraine ranks as the third most common disease in the world and the leading cause of disability among neurological disorders. Migraine will affect approximately 12% of the adult population globally, currently affecting approximately 38 million people in the United States, the majority of whom are women of childbearing years. Population-based studies of insured individuals reveal that, annually, 4.5% of the adult population seeks treatment for primary headache, the vast majority of which is for migraine. In the United States and EU, research has found that the age of first diagnosis of migraine peaks in the early-to-mid teens and the disease continues to persist throughout adulthood for many of these sufferers, demonstrating that it is often a disorder of long duration. 
 An estimated five million migraine patients in the United States require the care of a headache specialist. Among these specialists, many of whom also treat CH, are the approximately 1,100 physicians who are board-certified in the treatment of headache, many of whom practice in over 120 tertiary care centers in the United States. Although the triptan drug class is the current standard of care for the acute treatment of migraine, according to the U.S. Pharmacist, a leading pharmacy publication, more than 60% of patients have reported dissatisfaction with, or have contraindications to, the current standard of care, such as triptan medications. This dissatisfaction may partly explain the sub-25% penetration rate for available generic triptan medications. Despite these limitations, we estimate that the addressable market for the acute treatment of migraine in the United States in 2019 will be approximately $4.0 billion. 
 6

Economic Burden. Over the past several decades, migraine has been associated with persistently greater total annual medical costs. An independent study conducted in 1999 found that migraine sufferers in California had annual total medical expenses two and a half times higher than non-migraine sufferers. A 2011 study conducted by GNS Healthcare and sponsored by us demonstrated consistent results among the nearly 5% of 21 million privately insured patients in the United States who receive diagnosis of migraine annually. 
 Current Acute Migraine Treatments and Their Limitations. Triptan medications, or Triptans, are a family of tryptamine-based drugs first sold in the 1990s, which account for approximately 80% of the acute treatments prescribed for migraine. Triptans are sold in oral, nasal, and subcutaneous formulations. Through their binding to specific seratonin receptor subgroups, Triptans cause constriction of blood vessels in the outer covering of the brain, or the meninges. This vasoconstrictive activity may also affect blood vessels in other areas of the body, including the heart, which accounts for important risks associated with their use, and labeling limitations on the frequency of their use. 
 Other less commonly prescribed acute migraine treatments include ergotamines and analgesics, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, acetaminophen and antiemetics. Dihydroergotamine, or DHE, is a grain fungus derivative that, like triptans, is a potent vasoconstrictor. DHE has been used for more than 50 years for the treatment of migraine, but modern physicians rarely prescribe it because of significant side effects. More specifically, ergotamines and triptans are both vasoconstrictors with labels citing the risk of their use in migraine sufferers with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 
 Opioids are often dispensed for migraine attacks in emergency departments; however, in the treatment guidelines referenced by the National Institutes of Health, their use is not recommended for the acute treatment of migraine. Opioid use for migraine is associated with increased disability and health care utilization. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized the growing issue of opioid misuse, abuse and addiction and officially classified prescription opioid abuse as an epidemic. Data from a 2009 study conducted by the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study suggests that about 16% of migraine patients are current opioid users and 16% of those patients are likely dependent. 
 Although there are more prescription therapies available for migraineurs than CH sufferers, according to the U.S. Pharmacist, a leading pharmacy publication, upwards of 60% of the migraine patient population has reported dissatisfaction with, or has contraindications to, the current standard of care treatments for migraine. These medications include triptans, ergotamines and anti-epileptic medications. Despite the fact that neurologists recognize the limited efficacy of, and the potential for abuse associated with, opioids, they continue to be prescribed at high rates, particularly in emergency departments for the treatment of migraine. Many other primary headache conditions, and secondary headaches, such as post-traumatic headache, have proven refractory to pharmaceutical interventions, presenting a significant unmet need in the market.
 
Preclinical Evidence of nVNS Mechanism of Action in Acute Migraine 
 Although the cause of migraine is multifactorial, one validated model, shown in Figure 1 below, involves the activation of nerve fibers in the dura. These fibers lie in close proximity to blood vessels passing through the dura, and connect through the trigeminal ganglion to the Trigeminal Cervical Complex, or TCC. The TCC is a region of the brainstem associated with pain processing. Firing of the TCC involves the increased release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and is associated with migrainous pain. This activation is typically opposed by the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and GABA. Migraine pain may be experienced when excessive firing from the TCC exceeds the inhibitory mechanisms, or if the inhibitory mechanisms are not present.

Figure 1: The neural circuit believed to be associated with migraine 
 

(Figure adapted from S. Akerman and P. Goadsby, with permission)
To show the effects of nVNS, we sponsored a preclinical study at Thomas Jefferson University, published in Pain in 2014. In this study, animals were sensitized, rendering them allodynic, or sensitive to touch, and susceptible to increased pain when the known migraine trigger, nitroglycerine, or GTN, was administered. Previous research had shown significant increases in glutamate expression in the TCC, specifically in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis from GTN exposure. The results of our study, provided in Figures 2 and 3 below, showed that administration of nVNS simultaneously with, or 90 minutes after GTN was administered, reduced both the pain behavior and the over-expression of glutamate. 
 

Figure 2: Co-administered nVNS prevents the significant increase in glutamate expression triggered by GTN in sensitized animals.

Figure 3: Administration of nVNS, 90 minutes after GTN reduces over-expression of glutamate that occurs in sensitized animals. 
 

The pulsating character of migraine pain supports the inference of a relationship between activated nerve fibers and blood vessels that are in close proximity with one another. This pulsating feature, typically exacerbated by exercise, led early observers to suspect vasodilation as an underlying cause. As previously mentioned, triptans, which are vasoconstrictors, are the most widely prescribed medications for the acute treatment of migraine. Further, over the past decade, research in headache has included a focus on calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, which is a peptide released by neurons under a variety of stress and inflammatory conditions. CGRP is the most potent, endogenously produced vasodilator. The administration of exogenous CGRP in sensitized animals and human migraineurs has been shown to trigger pain-related behavior and migraines.
 Models of CGRP activity in migraine suggest that neurons releasing CGRP in the TCC result in the activation of pain pathway neurons, leading to acute headache pain. While several stresses can cause the release of CGRP, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNF-a, is known to trigger its synthesis and release from neurons. Heightened expression of TNF-a has been correlated with heightened expression of CGRP as well as its receptors. As previously mentioned, published results of multiple studies show that VNS is capable of suppressing TNF-a in the central nervous system. 
 
To further study the effects of our gammaCore therapy in migraine, and specifically as it relates to CGRP, we sponsored a series of studies in which animals were sensitized by chronic inflammation. These animals experience migraine-like pain upon exposure to a known migraine trigger, umbellulone. The results of this study, as shown in Figure 13 below, demonstrated that nVNS reduces pain responses of sensitized animals relative to that of naïve animals, whether the therapy is delivered before or after the trigger is administered. 
 Figure 4: Administration of nVNS after umbellulone exposure reduces pain-associated behavior in inflammation-sensitized animals.

In addition to the reduction in pain, nVNS reduced the expression of intracellular biomarkers of inflammation. These biomarkers are associated with an upregulation in TNF-a, and correspondingly, in CGRP synthesis and expression. 
 Clinical Data in support of gammaCore for Acute Migraine Treatment 
 We have completed one pilot and one pivotal trial examining the efficacy, safety and tolerability of gammaCore for the acute treatment of migraine headache as summarized in Table 2 below: 
 Table 2: Overview of Our Acute Migraine Trials for gammaCore 
 

Our First Open Label Trial in Acute Migraine 
 We sponsored a multi-center, pilot clinical trial to investigate the use of gammaCore for the acute treatment of migraine headache, published in 2014. The trial was an open-label, single-arm, multiple-attack trial conducted at four headache centers in the United States. Patients were asked to treat up to four acute migraine attacks with gammaCore over a six week period. The trial enrolled 30 patients, 25 of whom were female and 27 of whom treated at least one attack. 
 
Nineteen of the 27 patients treated their first attack at a pain level that was moderate or severe at baseline. Four of these 19 patients (21%) reported being pain free at two hours. Nine of 19 patients (47%) reported pain relief, defined as mild pain or pain free, at the same time point. The eight remaining patients treated their first attack while at mild pain at baseline, five of whom (63%) were pain free at two hours. Overall, these 27 patients treated 80 migraines, 54 of which were treated with a baseline pain level of moderate or severe. Twelve of 54 attacks (22%) were reported as pain free at two hours, and 23 of 54 attacks (43%) reached pain relief. The remaining 26 attacks were treated at mild pain, and pain freedom was achieved for 10 of these attacks (38%). The efficacy results from this trial are similar to other acute treatments for migraine. 
 This pilot trial demonstrated gammaCore is well tolerated in patients with acute migraine. Adverse events were of mild severity, transient in duration, and included local discomfort during and after gammaCore use, as well as mild skin reactions to the conductive gel. Based on the results of this trial, the authors noted that gammaCore seemed better tolerated than triptan medications and did not appear to have the cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risks associated with them. 
 The PRESTO Trial — Our Registration Trial for the Acute Treatment of Migraine 
 Our PRESTO trial, or PRESTO, was a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled prospective trial of gammaCore for the acute treatment of migraine. The trial enrolled 285 patients and was conducted at 10 centers in Italy, including academic medical centers and other tertiary headache clinics. Patients treated up to five migraine attacks with gammaCore or sham in a double-blind period, and up to five additional attacks with gammaCore in an open-label period. Two hundred forty eight of the 285 patients who were enrolled into the run-in period were eligible for randomization into the double-blind period (37 patients did not randomize, the majority of whom failed to meet the entry criteria for randomization.) Two hundred forty-three of the 248 enrolled patients treated at least one attack and represent the ITT population (gammaCore, n=120; sham, n=123). Of the ITT population, 239 entered the open label period, and 238 finished the open label period.
 The primary endpoint for the trial was response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved pain freedom at 120 minutes after treatment initiation for the first migraine treated. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the gammaCore and sham cohorts, however, clinically relevant trends were observed with respect to preventative medication use and pain level at baseline. A higher proportion of patients in the gammaCore cohort treated their first attack when its intensity was severe.

As shown in Figure 1 below, the proportion of patients in the gammaCore cohort who became pain-free after treating the first attack was measurably higher than those who treated with sham at 30 minutes (gammaCore, 12.7%; sham, 4.2%; p=0.01) and 60 minutes (gammaCore, 21.0%; sham, 10.0%; p=0.02) and at 120 minutes (gammaCore, 30.4%; sham, 19.7%; p=0.07; primary endpoint). The loss of statistical significance at 120 minutes was subsequently determined to be the result of autonomic activation by the sham device and a repeated-measures test, recommended by our independent statisticians, was employed to examine the inconsistency between the 120-minute finding and the 30- and 60-minute findings.  This statistical test confirmed the statistical significance of gammaCore’s superiority over sham for the pain-free outcome through 120 minutes (odds ratio: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.4; p=0.01).

As shown in Figure 6 below, mean percentage pain reduction for the first attack was significantly greater with gammaCore than with sham at 60 minutes (gammaCore, -25.4%; sham, -7.7%; p=0.03) and 120 minutes (gammaCore, -34.8%; sham, -5.4%; p<0.01). 
 Figure 6: Percent Pain Relief Results of the PRESTO Trial for Acute Migraine 
 

As shown in Figure 7 below, the proportion of patients who achieved pain relief, defined as mild or no pain, at 120 minutes was significantly higher with gammaCore than with sham for the first treated migraine attack (gammaCore, 40.8%; sham, 27.6%; p=0.03). The proportion of patients who responded at 120 minutes for ≥50% of their attacks was significantly higher with gammaCore than with sham for both pain freedom (gammaCore, 32.4%; sham, 18.2%; p=0.02) and pain relief (gammaCore, 47.6%; sham, 32.3%; p=0.03).

As has been the case in every trial conducted with gammaCore, no SAEs were attributable to gammaCore in PRESTO. 
 Migraine Prevention 
 As previously described, the grant by FDA of our de novo submission resulted in a new Class II regulatory category: External Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Headache (21 CFR 882-5892). The establishment of this product category permits us to apply for label expansions through the 510(k) regulatory pathway utilizing our own product as the predicate. With the recent clearance of our label expansion to CH, it is now our intention to seek the expansion of our label for the prevention of migraine. As described below, we have conducted, and continue to conduct clinical studies to support this indication. 
Migraine Prophylaxis Market
 According to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, only about 12% of adults with high frequency or chronic migraine take preventive medications. According to the American Migraine Foundation, medication side effects often limit the use of migraine medications. 
 Currently Used Therapies for Migraine Prevention and Their Limitations. Prior to the approval of CGRP antibodies by the FDA, there were five products approved by the FDA for the prevention of migraine: anti-epileptic drugs, topiramate (Topamax) and valproic acid (Depakote), beta-blockers, propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren), and BOTOX.  BOTOX is the only product that has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of chronic migraine, and its label is limited to that subgroup. In all cases, these medications were first approved for other uses. 
 These current treatments are ineffective or inconvenient for some patients, and their use has been limited by issues with tolerability and side effects, including cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance. Anti-epileptic drugs are also associated with poor pregnancy outcomes and fetal abnormalities, which is a concern for women of childbearing years. In clinical trials, these medications require four to six weeks of daily administration before most patients experience measurable clinical benefit. For example, BOTOX requires approximately 31 subcutaneous injections at various sites on the head and neck, repeated every 12 weeks. 
 There are currently three antibodies to CGRP and its receptor approved by FDA for the prevention of migraine by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Eli Lilly and Company, and by Amgen Inc., which is in a co-marketing partnership with Novartis International AG, approved by the FDA in May 2018. There are a number of medical devices that have been marketed for the treatment of migraine, including Cefaly and the Spring TMS device.
 We believe there is a need for a new therapy that can either prevent migraines or reduce their severity to a level at which supplemental existing abortive therapies can provide relief as needed, with reduced side effects. Such a therapy could provide benefit for both patients on existing therapies and patients who have abandoned therapy.

Mechanisms of Action Evidence Supporting gammaCore Use in Migraine Prevention 
 Approximately 25% of all migraine patients experience sensory symptoms known as “aura” prior to the pain stage of at least a portion of their migraine attacks. Aura is characterized by disruptions of visual perception and has been associated with synchronized depolarizations known as cortical spreading depressions, or CSDs, which are believed to occur more readily when the brain is in a hyperexcitability state. It is the ability of several anti-epileptic drugs to reduce brain hyperexcitability that led to their use for the prevention of migraine. 
 Implanted VNS was first developed clinically for the treatment of epilepsy, and early pilot studies in migraine and other severe headache conditions have suggested that VNS could have efficacy in the prevention of headache attacks.  To determine the mechanisms of action through which this prophylactic benefit might arise, we sponsored a series of pre-clinical studies at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The results, published in 2016, showed that our gammaCore therapy rapidly reduced brain hyperexcitability, as evidenced by an increase in the thresholds required for triggering CSDs, both through chemical and electrical means. In contrast to the chemical medications mentioned above, however, a two-minute dose of our therapy was able to multiply by approximately 2.5 times the intensity of the electrical trigger required to initiate CSDs within 20 minutes of initial treatment. This resistance to CSDs was also shown to persist for several hours after treatment, both slowing the number of CSDs triggered by a chemical exposure, but also the rate at which the CSDs propagated through the brain.  This compares favorably to drug treatments that require weeks to months of daily administration, often with associated side effects, before achieving clinical benefit. 
 It is not currently conclusively established what leads to hyperexcitation and susceptibility to migraine, however, recently published genetic and epigenetic studies suggest a strong association between migraine and genes tied to severe inflammatory conditions. These findings, coupled with recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the immune system affects the expression of neurotransmitters, CGRP, and their receptors, may enhance our explanations of how hyperexcitability arises, and how it leads to migraine susceptibility. To further this understanding, we sponsored studies in which prolonged inflammation was used to sensitize animals to respond to migraine triggers. 
 
In this work, twice-daily gammaCore treatments, administered during the prolonged inflammation period, inhibited sensitization. Animals treated with gammaCore during the prolonged period of induced inflammation were indistinguishable with respect to their responsiveness to a migraine trigger from a control animal group that had not been subjected to the prolonged inflammation.  In contrast, the active control group (subjected to the prolonged inflammation, but not treated with gammaCore, became sensitized and thus responded with pain behavior when exposed to the migraine trigger. Brainstem tissue from this sensitized group was analyzed and showed evidence of CGRP synthesis. In contrast, both non-sensitized animals and gammaCore-treated animals exhibit normal intracellular biomarkers of CGRP synthesis. 
 We believe these preclinical studies provide mechanistic support, both as a means for inhibiting a hyperexcitable brain state, as well as through the reduction in the biomarkers associated with pain pathway activation.  These pre-clinical results supported the development of gammaCore for the prevention of migraine. 
 Clinical Data in Support of gammaCore for Migraine Prevention 
 Our EVENT Trial – Chronic Migraine Headache Prevention with gammaCore 
 Our EVENT trial was a multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled pilot clinical trial with respect to the use of our gammaCore therapy for the prevention of chronic migraine and was published in 2016. This prospective double-blind pilot trial was conducted at six tertiary care headache centers in the United States. The trial included three consecutive periods: (1) a one-month baseline period during which patients provided data regarding their frequency of headache attacks to serve as a baseline comparator; (2) a two-month, randomized, sham-controlled period during which patients received prophylactic treatment with gammaCore or a sham; and (3) a six-month open-label period during which all patients received gammaCore. The primary objective of the EVENT trial was to assess the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of our gammaCore therapy, and as such, was not powered to reach statistical significance with respect to any efficacy measures. The trial enrolled 59 patients. 
 At baseline, the mean number of headache days in the gammaCore cohort (n=30) was 20.8 and 22.0 for the sham cohort (n=29). At the conclusion of the randomized period, the gammaCore cohort had experienced an average reduction of 1.4 migraine days while the sham cohort experienced a 0.2 migraine day decrease. The mean change from baseline was not statistically significant between groups. A per protocol cohort was identified in whom the mean migraine day reductions for the gammaCore and sham cohorts were 2.0 and 0.1, respectively. 
 13

During the open-label period, the original gammaCore cohort experienced continued reductions in migraine days. In this period, patients who had been assigned to the sham cohort gained access to gammaCore and began to show improvement. The data from this trial demonstrated that continued use of our gammaCore therapy provides increased benefit. A post hoc completers analysis demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions from baseline at the conclusion of the trial in both cohorts (initial gammaCore randomization cohort, 8.0 migraine-day reduction; initial sham randomization cohort, 6.0). 
 The primary purpose of this trial was safety and tolerability. Our gammaCore therapy was well tolerated and mild to moderate adverse events were generally similar in both groups. 
 The PREMIUM I Trial – Our Registration Trial for the Prevention of Migraine 
 Our PREMIUM I trial, or PREMIUM I, was a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled prospective trial of gammaCore for the prevention of migraine. The trial was conducted at 22 centers in Europe and enrolled 477 patients into a 28-day baseline run-in period, 341 of whom are included in the safety population.   Patients were instructed to treat themselves with two 120-second doses of gammaCore therapy or sham treatment, three times per day. Patients randomized to the sham treatment were offered the opportunity to use gammaCore during a 6 month open-label period following a three month blinded randomized period. 
 The primary endpoint for the trial was a reduction in the average number of migraine days per month during the third month of the randomized period compared to the average number of migraine days per month in the baseline period between the two cohorts.  Three hundred thirty-two patients (gammaCore, n=165; sham, n=167) were included in the ITT population. Of these patients, 278 (gammaCore, n=138; sham, n=140) complied with the trial requirement to self-administer no fewer than two-thirds of the specified treatments per month during the randomized period. This population represents an mITT. 
 For the ITT and mITT populations, the baseline average number of migraine days per month was similar between the two cohorts (gammaCore, 7.94 and 8.06, respectively; sham, 7.80 and 7.78, respectively). The primary endpoint was not met for the ITT population (gammaCore, -2.26; sham, -1.80; p=0.15; linear regression). However, as shown in Figure 8 below, statistical significance was achieved in reduction of migraine days per month, the primary endpoint metric, for the mITT population (gammaCore, -2.27 migraine days; sham, -1.53 migraine days; p=0.04; linear regression). 
 
Figure 8: Primary Endpoint Analysis of the ITT and mITT Populations for the PREMIUM Trial 
 

As shown in Figures 9 and 10 below, with respect to key secondary and exploratory endpoints, statistical significance was achieved across several measurements in the mITT population. As shown in Figure 9 below, the average percentage reduction in migraine days per month among the mITT population was greater for the gammaCore cohort compared with sham (gammaCore, 26.7%; sham, 16.8%; p<0.05). As shown in Figure 10 below, the reduction in the average number of headache days per month among the mITT population was greater for the gammaCore cohort compared with sham (gammaCore, -2.85; sham, 1.99; p=0.05). The mean reduction in days on which medication was required was statistically significant greater in the gammaCore cohort as compared with sham among the mITT population (gammaCore, -1.94; sham, -1.14; p<0.04). While not reaching statistical significance, the proportion of patients experiencing at least a 50% reduction in migraine days per month demonstrated a trend toward significance consistent with the previously reported endpoints (gammaCore, 31.6%; sham, 22.1%; p<0.08).

Figures 9 and 10: Additional Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint Analysis for the PREMIUM Trial 
 
 

Data from the recently completed open-label period of the PREMIUM trial was generally consistent with the earlier results from the randomized period with continued reductions in the number of migraine and headache days per month, as well as an increase in the number of subjects who had 50% reduction in the number of their monthly migraine days compared to when they started the trial. More specifically, during the open-label phase of the study, it should be noted that the patients who were initially assigned to the active therapy continued to show improvement, reaching average reductions of -2.56 migraine days and -2.52 migraine days after 6 and 9 months, respectively, on gammaCore.  Similarly, patients who were initially assigned to the sham arm, who were given access to the active therapy reached -1.82 and -2.08 migraine days after 3 and 6 months, respectively, on the active therapy.
 
In our PREMIUM trial, no SAEs were attributed to gammaCore. The PREMIUM trial demonstrated that our gammaCore therapy for acute migraine treatment has a highly favorable tolerability profile. 
 The PREMIUM II Trial – Our US Trial for the Prevention of Migraine 
 
Our PREMIUM II trial, or PREMIUM II, received its first enrolled patients in the fourth quarter of 2018, and had enrolled 70 patients as of March 15, 2019.  Like its predecessor, PREMIUM I, PREMIUM II is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled prospective trial of gammaCore for the prevention of migraine. This trial is being conducted at 30 centers in the United States, and is seeking to enroll a total of 400 patients. Patients are instructed to treat themselves with two 120-second doses of gammaCore therapy or sham treatment, three times per day. Patients randomized to the sham treatment are being offered the opportunity to use gammaCore during a 6-month open-label period following a 3-month blinded randomized period. 
 The primary endpoint for the trial is a reduction in the average number of migraine days per month during the third month of the randomized period compared to the average number of migraine days per month in the baseline period between the two cohorts.  In order to be admitted into the ITT population, patients must comply with the trial requirement to self-administer no fewer than two-thirds of the specified treatments per month during the randomized period.
 
We anticipate that this study will complete enrollment in the first quarter of 2020 with data readout anticipated in the third quarter of 2020.

Cluster Headache 
 As mentioned above, in April 2017, FDA granted our de novo submission, clearing our gammaCore for commercial sale in the United States for the acute treatment of pain associated with episodic cluster headache, or eCH, in adults. In accordance with our strategy to establish gammaCore as the preferred treatment for neurologists across headache, we initially targeted the high unmet need population of CH sufferers to establish relevance with prescribing clinicians and gain reimbursement from payers. In furtherance of this strategy, in December 2018, we were successful in receiving FDA clearance for gammaCore Sapphire as a prevention for cluster headache, the first product in the United States or Europe to receive regulatory approval for this indication.
 CH is a condition in which patients experience relatively short but extremely painful headache attacks that have been described by patients and physicians as some of the most painful known to medicine. CH predominantly affects males in their prime earning ages of 20 to 50, and the attacks of pain occur in bouts, known as cluster periods, during which attacks are experienced at a frequency ranging from other day to as often as eight times per day. Individual attacks typically last from 15 minutes to as long as three hours.  Among CH patients, 85% to 90% experience eCH, with their cluster periods, or bouts, lasting from two to 12 weeks, followed by a remission period, often cycling into bout twice per year. Chronic CH, or cCH, patients experience no periods of remission or remission periods of less than three months in a 12-month period. There is only one other FDA-approved commercially available pharmaceutical option for acute CH treatment, and gammaCore is the only FDA-cleared option for its prevention. 
 Our first FDA clearance, received following the grant of our de novo submission, was for the acute treatment of eCH in adults, and is supported by two pivotal trials: our ACT 1 trial, or ACT 1, and our ACT 2 trial, or ACT 2. The primary endpoints of these trials were pain reduction and pain-freedom within 15 minutes of the onset of the attack, respectively. While neither trial reached statistical significance with respect to its primary endpoint in the combined eCH and cCH populations, both trials reached statistical significance (ACT 1; 34.2%; ACT 2; 47.5%; p<0.01 in each trial) on the primary endpoint in the eCH cohort.
 Our FDA clearance for the prevention of CH in adults is principally supported by our pivotal trial, PREVA. The primary endpoint of PREVA was the reduction in number of CH attacks experienced per week during a test period (weeks 3 and 4 after initiating 3x daily treatments with gammaCore), as compared with the number of attacks per week during a baseline comparison period prior to initiation of gammaCore therapy. This trial met its primary endpoint with statistical significance for the reduction in the number of cluster attacks (-5.9 vs. -2.1; p<0.001).
 The Limitations of Pharmaceutical Treatment Options in Cluster Headache 
 There is only one FDA-approved commercially available pharmaceutical treatment for the acute treatment of CH, injectable sumatriptan. Patients have typically been limited to fewer than 10 injections per month, primarily due to cost and potential toxicity. In addition, the technical difficulty of subcutaneously self-injecting a medication during a CH attack may also limit use of this therapy. As a result, some patients typically have enough medication to treat, on average, only a fraction of their monthly CH attacks. Prior to gammaCore, there were no approved treatments for the prevention of CH, driving patients to use off-label medications, such as lithium, valproic acid and high-dose verapamil, which have unproven efficacy and the potential for significant toxicity, including adverse cardiac events. In a 2016 market research survey of CH patients, 87% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the then-available treatment options. 
Cluster Headache Market Factors
 Prevalence and market size. The estimated prevalence of CH in the United States ranges from 0.1% to 0.2% of the total population, with consensus around 350,000 as the number of affected patients, of which 225,000 patients seek medical treatment annually. eCH patients average approximately four months per year in bout. We estimate the total addressable market for the acute treatment of eCH in the United States in 2019 will be approximately $400 million. 
Economic Burden. According to a recent published study in The American Journal of Managed Care, the overall average medical costs for eCH patients over a three-year period exceeded $22,500, compared with $10,140 among non-headache sufferers. Similarly, the overall average pharmacy costs per eCH patient during this period were $8,200, which was nearly double that of the non-headache sufferers. Participants in surveys of sufferers indicate that CH is associated with a large socioeconomic burden. For example, research found that nearly 20% of patients with CH reported loss of employment and approximately 8% are unemployed or receiving disability services due to the disorder. 
 16

Other Therapies for the Acute Treatment of Cluster Headache. Other than gammaCore, there is only one FDA-approved commercially available therapy for acute treatment for CH, injectable sumatriptan (Imitrex). The side effect profile and cost of Imitrex, however, typically limits patient access to only six to 10 doses per month, which usually enables patients to treat only a small fraction of their attacks each month. Even at this limited access level, the monthly cost of Imitrex for CH patients and their insurance providers averages more than $700. Imitrex use is also limited by the requirement for patients to subcutaneously self-inject, which may be particularly difficult to do while experiencing a CH attack.
 Prior to the approval in December 2018 of gammaCore for the prevention of CH, there were no FDA approved pharmaceutical or device treatments for CH prophylaxis.  In a 2016 market research survey of CH patients, 87% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the then-available treatment options. 
 Preclinical Evidence of VNS Mechanisms of Action in Acute Cluster Headache 
 It is generally believed that the neural circuit involved in CH includes activation and inhibition of the trigeminal cervical complex, or TCC, shown in Figure 11 below. This circuit is similar to the one associated with migraine etiology, which is consistent with the successful use of injected migraine medications for the acute treatment of these attacks. There are important differences, however, between the two circuits.  In the case of CH, activation of facial nerves, including those relaying through the sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG, are believed to be associated with the activation of areas within the TCC. This belief is supported by evidence showing that activation of this pathway can cause CH-like attacks. As was the case with migraine, inhibition of the TCC is provided by inhibitory neurotransmitters, like serotonin, GABA and norepinephrine, which are released by neurons residing in the PAG, the NRM, and the locus coeruleus, or LC. 
 Figure 11: The neural circuit believed to be associated with CH. 
 

(Figure adapted from S. Akerman and P. Goadsby, with permission) 
 One possible mechanism by which gammaCore acutely treats CH attacks may be through enhancement of inhibitory signals to the TCC. To test this, we sponsored research in which recording electrodes were inserted into the TCCs of rats to measure the effects of VNS on normal activity, or ongoing spontaneous neuronal firing, and activity under pain-simulated conditions, or dural-evoked pain fiber firing, the latter being caused by irritation of the outermost covering of the brain, or dura. As seen in the published graphs in Figures 12 and 13 below, VNS significantly suppressed activity in the TCC in both cases. These data suggest that the strengthening of the inhibition pathways is a mechanism of action for gammaCore. 
 17

Figure 12: VNS applied in two doses, separated by five minutes, was able to suppress ongoing spontaneous firing of the neurons in the TCC, by more than 50%, with a duration of effect greater than two hours. 
 

Figure 13: A pair of VNS doses, separated by five minutes was able to suppress firing of the pain fibers in the TCC under pain simulated conditions by approximately 30%, with a stable duration of effect of more than two hours. 
 


Clinical Data of gammaCore as an Acute Treatment for Cluster Headache 
 We have completed one pilot trial and two parallel pivotal trials examining the efficacy, safety and tolerability of gammaCore for the acute treatment of CH as summarized in Table 2 below: 
 Table 2: Overview of our CH trials for gammaCore 
 

18

Our First Open-Label Trial 
 We sponsored an open-label trial of gammaCore for the acute treatment and prevention of CH at the Royal Free Hospital, published in Neurology in 2015. The trial enrolled 25 patients, 19 of whom provided evaluable data. Of these evaluable patients, 11 had cCH and 8 had eCH. Seven of the cCH patients were considered to be drug-refractory and had failed reasonable attempts with multiple different preventative agents. Five patients with cCH provided long-term data for a full 52 weeks. In this trial, an evaluation of the efficacy of the therapy was based on patient-reported estimates of their CH attack frequency. 
 Fifteen of the 19 evaluable patients in this trial reported an overall improvement in their condition from baseline, with four stating that their condition had remained the same. No patients reported a worsening of their preexisting condition. Results demonstrated a mean improvement of 48% in CH attack frequency. Five of the eleven cCH patients had a one-year extended follow-up, which showed a mean estimated improvement in attack frequency at 26 weeks of 62% and maintenance at 52 weeks of 58%. In regard to acute efficacy, patients in this trial reported that gammaCore aborted attacks within an average time of 11 minutes of initial treatment. The long-term durability of this response was stable in four of the five patients with cCH who reported on their gammaCore use at both 26 and 52 weeks. 
 No serious adverse events were reported in this trial during and after treatment. Adverse events of mild severity reported in this trial included local discomfort during and after device use and mild skin reactions to the conductive gel. 
 Our Registration Trials for Acute Treatment of CH – ACT 1 and ACT 2 
 Our first FDA clearance, received following the grant of our de novo submission, was for the acute treatment of eCH, and is supported by two multi-center, randomized clinical studies, ACT 1 and ACT 2. These trials, in aggregate, enrolled 253 patients, including both eCH and cCH patients. The primary endpoints of these trials were pain reduction and pain freedom within 15 minutes of the onset of the attack, i.e. mild pain or pain-free in ACT 1 and pain-free in ACT 2. Neither trial reached statistical significance with respect to the primary endpoint in the total population, but they did reach statistical significance on the primary endpoint and multiple secondary endpoints in their eCH subpopulation. eCH represents 80-90% of the overall CH population. In ACT 1, our gammaCore therapy demonstrated an ability to reduce pain to mild or pain-free status in eCH patients within 15 minutes of the onset of the attack more than three times as frequently as the sham treatment (gammaCore, 34.2%; sham, 10.6%; p<0.01). In ACT 2, which had a more stringent primary endpoint, our gammaCore therapy demonstrated an even stronger therapeutic effect compared to the sham treatment among eCH patients (gammaCore, 47.5%; sham, 6.2%; p<0.01). 
 Our ACT 1 and ACT 2 Trials – gammaCore for the Acute Treatment of Episodic Cluster Headache 
 ACT 1 was a pivotal, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled prospective trial of gammaCore for the acute treatment of CH. The trial enrolled 150 patients and was conducted at 20 centers in the United States, including academic medical centers and other tertiary headache clinics.  Similarly, ACT 2 was a pivotal, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled prospective trial of gammaCore for the acute treatment of eCH and cCH. It enrolled 103 patients and was conducted in four European countries at academic medical centers and other tertiary headache clinics.
 ACT 1 was designed to establish the superiority of our gammaCore therapy in comparison to sham treatment, and in the double-blind phase of the trial 150 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive gammaCore therapy or sham treatment for one month or until five CH attacks were treated. The primary endpoint for the trial was response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved pain relief (pain intensity of 0 or 1 on a 5 point scale) at 15 minutes after treatment initiation for the first CH attack treated. Investigators, patients, and study coordinators were blinded to treatment assignments in the double-blind phase of the trial. The ACT 1 results were published in Cephalalgia in 2016. 
133 of the 150 patients enrolled in this trial met the criteria for the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population (gammaCore, n=60; sham, n=73). Of the 133 patients in the ITT cohort, most had eCH (85) and the remaining had cCH (48). Response rates for the primary endpoint in the total ITT population, which includes both eCH and cCH patients, were numerically superior for gammaCore as compared with sham treatment (gammaCore, 26.7%; sham, 15.1%; p=0.1). More importantly, as shown in Figure 14 below, in a predefined analysis of the eCH subpopulation, a significantly higher response rate was demonstrated with gammaCore than with sham (gammaCore, 34.2%; sham, 10.6%; p<0.01). Superior sustained treatment response rates were statistically significant for gammaCore compared with sham among the total population (gammaCore, 26.7%; sham, 12.3%; p=0.04), however, this superior response was most pronounced for the eCH subpopulation (gammaCore, 34.2%; sham, 10.6%; p<0.01). This observation of strongest clinical benefit in the eCH cohort was also demonstrated with respect to the proportion of patients who were responders at 15 minutes for ≥50% of their treated attacks (gammaCore, 34.2%; sham, 14.9%; p=0.04). Results were also significant in the eCH subpopulation for the proportion of those who were pain-free at 15 minutes for ≥50% of treated attacks (gammaCore, 15.8%; sham, 2.1%; p=0.04).

Figure 14: Selected Results for eCH Patients in the ACT 1 Trial 
 

ACT 2 was also designed to assess the superiority of our gammaCore therapy in comparison to sham treatment, with a two-week, randomized, double-blind period during which patients were treated with either our gammaCore or sham therapy. The primary endpoint for the trial was response rate, defined as the proportion of all attacks that achieved pain freedom at 15 minutes after treatment initiation. That is, unlike the ACT 1 trial, in which patients were assessed based upon the only first attack treated, in the ACT 2 trial, all attacks treated during the randomized period were assessed.  In total, 495 attacks were treated with active gammaCore therapy and 400 with the sham treatment. The ACT 2 trial results were published in Cephalalgia in April 2018.
 In the ACT 2 trial, 103 patients were enrolled, 102 patients met the criteria for the safety population, and 92 patients met the criteria for the ITT population (gammaCore, n=48; sham, n=44). Of all 102 patients in the safety population, most had cCH (71%) and the remaining 29% had eCH. Although eCH occurs more frequently than cCH, we enrolled more cCH patients in the ACT 2 trial because a greater proportion of them are in bout at any given time. 
 Figure 15: Selected Results for predefined eCH subpopulation in the ACT 2 Trial 
 


As shown in Figure 15 above, consistent with the results from the ACT 1 trial, among the eCH subpopulation, a higher proportion of treated attacks achieved pain-free status with gammaCore than with sham (gammaCore, 47.5%; sham, 6.2%; p<0.01).  The proportion of responders, defined as patients who reached pain-freedom for 50% or more of their treated attacks within 15 minutes of onset of the attack was also statistically significantly greater among the gammaCore cohort than for the sham group (gammaCore 64.3%; sham 15.4%; p<0.01).
 
20

No serious adverse events, or SAEs, were attributable to gammaCore in either ACT 1 or ACT2. In the ACT1 trial, across all patients, 33% (49/150) had one or more adverse events, or AEs, during the double-blind period (gammaCore, 18; sham, 31). AEs occurred in 35 patients during the double-blind phase, at more than double the rate in the sham cohort than the gammaCore subpopulation. Similarly, in the ACT 2 trial, of all patients, 33% (34/102) had one or more AEs during the double-blind phase of the trial. Of the non-serious AEs, 19 patients (gammaCore, 9; sham, 10) experienced one or more treatment-related AEs during the double-blind phase of the trial. The most commonly occurring of these AEs were application site reactions, all of which were mild, transient, and tended to be self-limiting in nature. 
 
Our Pooled Analysis of ACT1 and ACT2 for the Acute Treatment of Episodic Cluster Headache 
 To further explore the benefits of gammaCore for the acute treatment of eCH, the data from ACT 1 and ACT 2 were pooled to assess the overall response to each trial’s primary endpoint, as shown in Figure 16 below. Collectively there were 112 eCH patients and 113 cCH in the pooled data set. Among the 112 patients with eCH, more patients who treated with gammaCore achieved mild or pain-free status at 15 minutes for the first attack treated (the ACT1 primary endpoint) compared with those in the sham cohort (gammaCore, 38.5%; sham, 11.7%; p<0.01). Similarly, the proportion of all treated attacks in these eCH subpopulation reaching pain freedom at 15 minutes (the ACT 2 primary endpoint) was greater in the gammaCore cohort compared to the sham cohort (gammaCore, 24.1%; sham, 7.3%; p<0.01). Both studies individually met statistical significance on this endpoint (ACT 1: gammaCore, 15%; sham, 6%; p<0.05; ACT 2: gammaCore, 48%; sham, 6%; p<0.05). 
 The proportion of these eCH patients who achieved mild or pain-free status at 15 minutes in ≥50% of their treated attacks was higher for gammaCore compared to sham (gammaCore, 42.3%; sham, 15.0%; p=0.01). These findings are consistent with the findings of each trial individually (ACT 1: gammaCore, 34.2%; sham, 14.9%; p=0.04; ACT 2: gammaCore, 64.3%; sham, 15.4%; p=0.02). 
 Figure 16: Selected Results of the Pooled Analysis of the ACT 1 and ACT 2 Trials for eCH Patients 
 

This analysis demonstrated that gammaCore is effective and well tolerated in aborting attacks in eCH, but did not appear to have similar efficacy in cCH. Important advantages over existing treatment options are that gammaCore is easy-to-use and may be applied for as many attacks as a patient experiences per day, without the frequency-of-use restrictions and contraindications associated with other treatments. 
 Cluster Headache Prevention 
 The grant by FDA of our de novo submission in 2017 resulted in a new Class II regulatory category: External Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Headache (21 CFR 882-8592). The establishment of this product category permits us to apply for label expansions through the 510(k) regulatory pathway utilizing our own product as the predicate.  In December 2018, the FDA cleared our therapy, gammaCore, for the prevention of CH.
 21

Currently Used Therapies for Cluster Headache Prevention and Their Limitations. There are no products, other than gammaCore, that are currently approved by the FDA, or any other regulatory agency in any major market in the world, for the prevention of cluster headache.  Medications that have been used, include valproic acid, verapamil, and lithium, all of which carry significant risks, and have limited evidence of efficacy in this regard.  We believe there is a need for a therapy that can prevent cluster headaches, with limited side effects. The fact that gammaCore is also cleared for acute treatment in episodic cluster headache, and patients have up to thirty doses of therapy available to them for every day of their prescribed treatment period, it is convenient for patients to use the available doses to prevent attacks through prophylactic treatments, and to acutely treat those attacks that are not eliminated by the preventative use.
 Mechanisms of Action Evidence Supporting gammaCore Use in Cluster Headache Prevention 
 As previously presented in combination with Figure 11, a prevailing theory of cluster headache pathology involves the activation of a neural circuit affecting trigeminal cervical complex, or TCC, a key region of the brainstem associated with pain processing. In this model, activation of facial nerves, including those relaying through the sphenopalatine ganglion, or SPG, activate the TCC. While inhibition of the TCC by upregulation of inhibitory neurotransmitter release may provide acute benefits to abort a cluster attack, the suppression of the causes of facial nerve activation may provide a means for preventing the cluster headaches from arising.  Inflammation is an important activator of nerve firing.
 For this reason, at the initiation of an episodic cluster headache patient’s bout, although there is limited clinical evidence supporting its use, it has been observed that prednisone, which is known to be a potent general anti-inflammatory agent, is often able to reduce the frequency of attacks.  Unfortunately, prednisone, and other similar glucocorticoid agents, have significant side effects that become increasingly negative as use of the medication continues beyond the short-term.  
 Preclinical and clinical evidence has shown that VNS has potent anti-inflammatory effects, through a neurochemically mediated downregulation of immune cell activity known as the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, or CAP.  The CAP functions through the release of acetylcholine, binding to a specific receptor expressed on the surface of key cells in the immune system, including macrophages and monocytes in the periphery and microglia in the central nervous system.  VNS is known to upregulate the release of acetylcholine, both centrally and peripherally.  In accordance with the theory of cluster headache pathophysiology, therefore, it was hypothesized that VNS would serve to reduce inflammatory activation of the facial nerves, and thereby prevent the activation of the neural circuit that causes cluster attacks.
 Our Registration Trial for the Prevention of CH – PREVA 
 Our most recent FDA clearance, received in December 2018, was for the prevention of CH, and is supported by a multi-center, randomized clinical trial, PREVA, as well as accumulated case series data from several clinical sites in the United Kingdom. The PREVA trial enrolled 114 patients with 97 patients randomized and was conducted at 10 sites in Europe, including academic medical centers and other tertiary headache clinics. PREVA was designed to assess the superiority of adjunctive use of our gammaCore therapy with standard of care medications in comparison to standard of care medication alone, and included three periods: (1) a two-week baseline phase during which all patients received only their individualized standard of care, or SoC, (2) a four-week randomized period during which participants were randomly assigned the adjunctive treatment or SoC arms; and (3) a four-week open label period during which all participants received adjunctive gammaCore therapy. The primary endpoint for the trial was defined as the mean change from baseline in the number of weekly attacks in the third and fourth week of the randomized period compared with the average weekly attack rate in the baseline period. 
 More specifically, in PREVA, 114 patients were enrolled and assessed at baseline, 97 of whom provided baseline data and were considered reliable trial participants. Of these patients, 93 met the criteria for inclusion in the ITT population having provided evaluable data (gammaCore, n=45; SoC, n=48). Of the ITT population, 92 provided data in the open-label period (gammaCore, n=44; SoC, n=48). Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between these groups and were representative of the overall CH population. Use of SoC medications was also comparable between groups. A modified ITT, or mITT, population, defined to include only patients with measurable data across the respective study periods (gammaCore, 37/45; SoC, 47/48), was also provided in the primary publication of these data in 2016. 
 22

As shown in Figure 17 below, during the randomized period, participants receiving adjunctive gammaCore treatment had a significantly greater reduction from baseline in the number of CH attacks per week compared to those receiving SoC alone (gammaCore, -5.9; SoC, -2.1; p<0.02). In the mITT population, the therapeutic benefit was more pronounced in the adjunctive gammaCore cohort (gammaCore, -7.2; SoC, -2.1; p<0.001). To determine the efficacy of longer-term prophylactic use of gammaCore, the reduction in the number of CH attacks during the open label period was examined in the 30 patients who continued adjunctive gammaCore use through this period. These patients reported a statistically significant reduction of two CH attacks per week (p<0.001) compared with the randomized period, suggesting further benefit with continued adjunctive use of our therapy. 
 
Figure 17: Primary Endpoint Analysis of the ITT and mITT Populations for the PREVA Trial 
 

As shown in Figure 18 below, in the ITT population, a significantly higher proportion of the patients receiving adjunctive gammaCore treatment experienced a ≥50% reduction in CH attack frequency during the randomized period compared with the SoC cohort (gammaCore, 40.0%; SoC, 8.3%; p<0.001). Similarly, the response rate in the mITT population was also significantly higher for individuals receiving adjunctive gammaCore therapy (gammaCore, 48.6%; SoC, 8.5%; p<0.001), suggesting that patients who remained in the trial had greater response. 
 Figure 18: Responder Rate Analysis for the ITT and mITT Populations in the PREVA Trial 
 

23

The use of abortive medications to acutely treat CH attacks was reported during all three periods of the trial. Changes in the use of acute medication are generally used as a surrogate for efficacy in preventing the occurrence of CH attacks. Reliable data on the use of abortive medications was only available in the mITT population. The number of times abortive medications were used in this population during the last two weeks of each trial period is shown in Figure 19 below. During the randomized period, the gammaCore cohort reported a statistically significant decrease of 61.1% (p<0.01) in the frequency of use of subcutaneous sumatriptan injections over the baseline period, whereas the SoC cohort reported an 10.3% increase in the use of this injected medication over baseline. Changes in the use of high-flow oxygen showed a similar difference in favor of adjunctive gammaCore use in that the reduction in its use among the gammaCore cohort was 62.4% (p=0.02) compared with only a 14.3% reduction in the SoC cohort. Similar results were seen in the open-label period. 
 Figure 19: Change in Abortive Medication Use for the mITT Population in the PREVA Trial 
 

In our PREVA trial, no SAEs were attributable to gammaCore. During the two months of treatment, similar proportions of participants in the gammaCore cohort and SoC cohort (gammaCore, 52%; SoC, 49%) reported AEs. Most AEs were mild or moderate (93% (108/116)). Overall, the most common AEs were CH attacks (gammaCore, 1; SoC, 5), along with nasopharyngitis, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and neck pain. 
 In summary, this trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that daily adjunctive prophylactic use of our gammaCore therapy significantly reduced the number of CH attacks per week, which led to substantial reductions in abortive medication use. 
 Additional Data Supportive of the Prevention of CH – Marin, et al.
 
In September 2018, Marin, et al., published the findings from 30 patients with chronic (29) and episodic (1) cluster headache from 10 clinical centers through the United Kingdom who had been prescribed gammaCore for an average period of 7.6 (range: 0.9 to 27.5) months.  This group was previously taking a variety of medications to prevent and/or acutely treat their cluster headache attacks, and for the purposes of this analysis, these treatments were considered “standard of care”, or SoC, despite none having regulatory approval for the prevention of cluster headache.
 
Of this group, 16 used gammaCore exclusively for prevention, 13 used the therapy both as an acute treatment as well as preventatively, while only 1 chose to use it exclusively to abort attacks. The mean dosing for prevention was 5.6 (range: 2.0 to 9.0) doses per day, and the average number of doses used acutely was 4.3 (range: 0.4 to 18.0)
 
24

As provided in Figure 20a below, among the 29 patients who used the therapy preventatively, the mean attack frequency prior to initiating treatment with gammaCore was 26.6 (range: 3.8 to 77.0) attacks per week, which was considered statistically significant (p<0.01).  This dropped to an average of 9.5 (range: 0.0 to 38.5) attacks per week.  As shown in Figure 20b below, twenty-five patients reported on the effects of gammaCore on the duration of their attacks, and they reported a decrease from an average of 51.9 (range: 5.0 to 140.0) minutes to 29.4 (range: 2.5-152.5) minutes, which was also statistically significant (p<0.01).  As shown in Figure 20c below, the severity of the attacks experienced was also reduced from 7.8 out of 10.0 (range: 3.0 to 10.0) to 6.0 (range 1.0 to 10.0), which was also statistically significant (p<0.01).
 

Twenty-two of the patients in this analysis reported regular triptan medications in the form of an injection or a nasally administered treatment for their acute management of cluster attacks prior to initiating on the gammaCore therapy.  Of the 22, 9 (41%) reported a complete cessation of triptan use, and 12 (55%) reported a reduction in triptan usage.  Similarly, 27 of the 30 patients in this analysis reported inhaling high flow oxygen as an abortive treatment prior to initiating on gammaCore therapy.  After treatment, 9 (33%) reported complete stoppage of this practice, and 17 (63%) reported a reduction in their use of oxygen.  (One patient continued the use of oxygen without change.)
 
No serious device-related AEs were reported during nVNS therapy, and consistent with these previous studies, AEs were mild and transient and were typically reported early in the evaluation period, when the use of nVNS was relatively novel.
 
Additional Headache Opportunities 
 Migraine in Adolescents. Peak migraine penetrance occurs during adolescence and parents may be hesitant to place children on medication. Our clinician advisors have indicated their belief that our gammaCore therapy would be particularly well received in this population given its tolerability profile. We are currently partnered with opinion leaders from academic medical centers and other tertiary headache centers to develop a clinical trial that we expect to initiate in the second half of 2018 to support a label expansion for gammaCore to include patients as young as 12 years of age. 
 Post-Traumatic Headache. Unlike migraine and CH, which are primary headaches, Post-Traumatic Headaches, or PTH, are classified as secondary headaches because they have a clear causation associated with head trauma. Research has shown that head trauma activates immune cells in the central nervous system. This activation can lead to a disruption in neurotransmitter expression, hyperexcitation, and to the production of CGRP. 
 25

VNS, including gammaCore therapy, has been shown to be effective in reducing this immune cell activation. Our clinical and scientific advisors have indicated their belief that our gammaCore therapy has the potential to offer therapeutic benefit for this patient population. We are currently developing a clinical trial that we expect to initiate in the second half of 2018 to support a label expansion for gammaCore to include PTH. 
 Our Pipeline 
 Rheumatology 
 The Anti-inflammatory Mechanisms of VNS 
 The systemic anti-inflammatory effects of VNS are believed to result from the activation of sympathetic fibers in the splenic nerve, through a connection at the celiac ganglion. These sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine into the spleen in close proximity to a specialized group of immune cells that release acetylcholine, or ACh. This release of ACh activates a receptor, the alpha 7 nicotinic ACh receptor, or a7nAChR, on cytokine-releasing immune cells called macrophages. Activation of these receptors is believed to function by blocking transcription factors that promote inflammatory cytokine expression. Based on the role of ACh in activating this pathway, which is shown in Figure 21 below, it has been termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, or CAP. 
Figure 21: The Cholinergic Anti-Inflammatory Pathway 
 

Evidence of gammaCore’s Modulation of Peripheral Immune Activity
 In order to determine if our non-invasive approach to VNS was able to trigger the CAP, we sponsored several trials to determine the magnitude of the effects of gammaCore on immune activity.  The first of these trials was conducted at the University of California San Diego, and its results were published in Neuromodulation in 2017. In this trial a total of 20 healthy males and females were randomized to receive either nVNS or sham stimulation. All subjects underwent an initial blood draw at 8:00 AM, followed by stimulation with nVNS or SST at 8:30 AM. Stimulation with either nVNS or sham was repeated at 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Additional blood samples were withdrawn 90 minutes and 24 hours after the first stimulation. All samples were tested in accordance with published methods, and levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured, which revealed a significant percent decrease in the levels of the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-a) levels, and chemokine, interleukin - 8 (IL-8), macrophage inflammatory protein - 1a  (MIP-1a), and monocyte chemoattractant protein – 1 (MCP-1) levels was observed in the nVNS group at the 24-hour time point (p<0.05).
 
Subsequent to this trial, researchers at the University of Newcastle studied the effects of gammaCore on circulating cytokine expression among a group of rheumatoid patients with primary Sjögren’s Syndrome, or pSS. These results were published in Neuromodulation in 2018.  In this trial, fifteen female pSS subjects were instructed to treat themselves with the gammaCore twice daily over a 26-day period. At baseline, blood was drawn before and after application of the gammaCore treatment, which was delivered bilaterally, and additional samples were collected after 7, 26, and 28 days, with the final sample being taken two days following the final application of the therapy. In accordance with published methods, levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, were all shown to be significantly reduced over the baseline measures at 90 minutes, 7 days, 26 days, and 28 days (See Figure 22 below). In addition, IP-10 and MIP-1α were shown to have decreased by statistically significant amounts by 26 and 28 days (not shown).

Rheumatoid Arthritis 
 Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is a chronic autoimmune disorder primarily affecting joints, and in particular the synovial tissue within the joint capsule. The condition is characterized by observable inflammation in the synovial tissue of affected joints, with associated warmth, swelling, pain, and loss of function around the inflammation. Symptoms typically worsen following rest. The most commonly affected areas include smaller joints of the body such as the wrists, hands, and feet, and typically affects the same joints on both sides of the body. 
 Uncontrolled RA is associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality. The current standard of care involves treating patients early and aggressively to prevent, or significantly retard the progression of joint damage. This is important, as progression of joint damage is directly correlated with debility, disability and loss of function. Approximately 2.4 million patients, predominantly women, suffer from RA in the United States. Current treatments for RA have been shown to possess a disease modifying effect, in addition to being effective at controlling signs and symptoms. Some agents used in the treatment of RA, most notably the biologics have shown effectiveness in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. 
 Inflammatory cytokines have long been identified in the pathogenesis of RA. Medications that inhibit immune activity, either broadly, like corticosteroids, or biologic agents, specifically targeting individual cytokines, have been key treatment options for RA patients. Typically, patients with RA initiate treatment with methotrexate, or MTX, which is sufficient to arrest the disease progression and provide relief of the disabling symptoms in approximately 25% of the affected population. Despite being generically available, the average cost of chronic MTX treatment in the United States still averages greater than $200 per month. 
 Incomplete response to MTX requires additional therapy, typically in the form of a biologic treatment, the most common of which are antibodies or antibody-like proteins that bind to TNF-a. By targeting TNF-a, these treatments alter the normal functioning of the immune system, and as such carry significant risks related to opportunistic infections and several forms of cancers. Approximately 40% of patients with RA are successfully treated with this class of medications, but at an average cost of $30,000 per year. Estimates suggest that of the more than $30 billion of annual global sales of these medications, sales for RA and related conditions of ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis exceed $15 billion. 
 Those patients who are inadequately managed by MTX and/or anti-TNF-a agents, typically advance to other biologic agents that attempt to either block the circulating levels of other target inflammatory cytokines, or agents that block the intracellular pathways that promote the production of inflammatory cytokines. The latter includes the Janus kinase inhibitors, such as Xeljanz, which have an annual cost currently ranging from $40,000 to over $60,000. 
 27

Initial clinical evidence for the use of VNS in RA was published in 2016 reporting on an open label pilot trial of implanted VNS among a group of 17 RA patients who had failed standard of care therapy (7 MTX incomplete responders and 10 who had failed at least two biologic agents). As shown in Figure 23 below, the results of this trial demonstrated clinical improvement in disease activity score, or DAS28, over a six-week period of about 2.5 points in MTX incomplete responders and about 1.5 points in biologic failures greater than 1.5 points. Patients had their VNS therapy deactivated for a two-week period following the initial six-week treatment period, during which time DAS28 scores rapidly returned to prior activity levels. This trend reversed and trended towards improvement when VNS therapy was re-initiated. 
 Figure 23: Mean change in DAS scores reported following implantation of and activation of VNS devices. 
 

In order to rapidly assess whether the cytokine changes demonstrable in healthy normal volunteers and in pSS patients using gammaCore could translate into similar effects as seen in the pilot trial of implanted VNS, our academic partners at Aarhus and Aalborg Universities conducted an open-label pilot trial of gammaCore among 16 RA patients with high disease activity. Participants in the study had their DAS28-CRP, cardiac vagal tone and pro-inflammatory cytokines measured at baseline and after 1 day and 4 days of nVNS.  Patients were instructed to treat using two doses of stimulation, delivered bilaterally over the vagus nerve in the neck, three times per day, and were assessed on the 5th day. Patients were excluded if they had received oral, intra-articular or topical corticosteroids within the preceding four weeks.
 
The results of this trial, which were presented at the EULAR Conference in 2018, showed that among the participants with high rheumatoid arthritis activity, nVNS resulted in a statistically significant reduction in DAS28-CRP (p=0.02), a reduction in C-reactive protein, or CRP (p=0.01), and interferon - γ (IFN- γ) (p=0.02).  In addition, the number of swollen joints were significantly reduced (p=0.05) and the reduction in the number of tender joints was trending toward significance (p=0.07). It is important to note that these effects were observed within 4 days of initiating nVNS was well tolerated.
 Based on these results, we are currently supporting a multi-centered, open-label, Investigator Initiated Trial, or IIT, among rheumatoid arthritis patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory results with methotrexate and have similarly failed to stop the progression of their disease having tried at least two different biologic agents having different mechanisms of action.  We anticipate data from this IIT will guide our decision-making as we move toward sponsoring randomized, sham-controlled registration trials beginning in the latter half of 2019.
 To that end, we are preparing for a pre-IDE meeting with the FDA to confer with its reviewers regarding a multi-center, randomized, double blind, sham-controlled trial of gammaCore therapy for the treatment of RA and to confirm that the FDA’s review of such an application would proceed through the de novo pathway for a signs and symptoms labeling claim. As our potential trials progress, we may, at the appropriate time, conduct premarket activities in rheumatology, such as market analysis, physician and patient segmentation research, and promotional and campaign development. 
 Sjögren’s Syndrome 
 Based upon the results of the Initial pilot trial conducted at the University of Newcastle among pSS patients, we are interested in paralleling our market penetration strategy in headache.  That is, we are interested in further studying the effects of gammaCore in Sjögren’s syndrome, a condition with high unmet need and no currently approved disease modifying treatments. We believe that establishing credibility among clinicians, by successfully treating this high unmet need will maximize our ability to penetrate areas like rheumatoid arthritis. 
 28

Sjögren’s syndrome is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by damage to, and ultimate loss of, moisture-producing glands. The primary clinical consequence of this damage is dry mouth and dry eyes, which can cause significant tooth loss and ocular injury. Related similar symptoms can include dry skin, a chronic cough, and vaginal dryness. Primary Sjögren’s syndrome, defined as being independent of other rheumatologic conditions, affects approximately 600,000 people in the United States, primarily women. Secondary Sjögren’s syndrome arises in conjunction with other inflammatory conditions, and increases the number of Sjögren’s sufferers to approximately four million people in the United States. 
 It is believed that the disease begins with increased inflammatory cytokine levels of IL-1β. The elevated level of IL-1βis believed to be the underlying cause of the debilitating fatigue and sleepiness, symptoms that are often the cause of the greatest loss in quality of life among Sjögren’s patients. This fatigue is a symptom of what is referred to as cytokine-induced sickness behavior. 
 Sickness behavior is a coordinated set of behavioral changes associated with extended periods of inflammation, including inability to concentrate, lethargy, malaise, fatigue, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, depression, and anxiety. These symptoms are common across many conditions in rheumatology. 
 As discussed previously, an initial open label pilot trial of gammaCore for the treatment of pSS was conducted at the University of Newcastle, and partially funded by the U.K. Arthritis Foundation, the results of which were presented at the 2017 American College of Rheumatology annual meeting and subsequently published in Neuromodulation in 2018. This trial enrolled 15 patients, all of whom provided evaluable data. At the beginning of this trial, enrolled patients provided baseline self-assessments of multiple key symptoms of their condition and, as previously described, blood samples were taken to establish baseline cytokine and other biomarker expression levels. Patients were instructed to self-administer gammaCore twice daily, each treatment comprising two doses. Patients returned after seven days to provide self-assessments and additional blood samples. Patients continued this treatment protocol through a total of 26 days. On day 28, after a two-day treatment hiatus, patients provided self-assessments of their symptoms and additional blood samples both before, and 90 minutes following a final gammaCore treatment.
 
In this study, 12 out of 15 participants reported an improvement in their fatigue scores, with 7 showing a ≥30% reduction in fatigue within 28 days. One participant did not report any improvement and two participants observed an initial improvement before returning to their baseline score at the final visit. As shown in Figure 24 below, these clinical results were statistically significant for reductions in physical fatigue and sleepiness, with trends toward significance for mental fatigue and abnormal fatigue. None of the participants reported worsening of their symptoms.
 
Figure 24: Reductions in key fatigue and sleepiness measurements from baseline through Day 26 in Sjögren’s syndrome patients using gammaCore therapy. 
 

The results of this initial trial were sufficient for the academic collaborators at the University of Newcastle to receive a larger continuing grant from the UK Arthritis Foundation, enabling them to conduct a 40-patient randomized, sham-controlled trial of gammaCore for the treatment of pSS. While not yet published, the preliminary results from this trial are consistent with the findings from the initial pilot study, with gammaCore providing statistically significant improvement in the primary efficacy measure, which was fatigue symptoms.
 29

We are currently preparing for a pre-investigational device exemption, or IDE, meeting with the FDA to gain clarity regarding a pivotal trial design that could support an application for a labeling claim for the signs and symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome, and confirm that the FDA’s review of such an application would proceed through the de novo pathway.
 Additional Rheumatology Opportunities 
 Raynaud’s Phenomenon. A common co-morbid symptom experienced by patients with rheumatoid conditions, including scleroderma, is Raynaud’s Phenomenon, or simply Raynaud’s. Raynaud’s is a condition caused by spasms in the smooth muscle lining of the vasculature, which leads to inadequate perfusion to the extremities. Typically triggered by exposure to rapid changes in temperature, such as inserting fingers or hands into cold water, onset of symptoms leads to ischemia of the tissue, pain, loss of sensation or function, and in extreme cases, the ischemia can lead to ulcerations requiring amputation. There is no current therapy for Raynaud’s, however, as this condition is associated with an autonomic dysfunction, and because migraine is a frequent co-morbidity among these patients, we were approached by a key academic opinion leader in the field of Raynaud’s, and have elected to support his IIT.  This trial, which is expected to enroll and randomize 40 patients, is expected to initiate in the first half of 2019.
 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Similarly, chronic fatigue is a common symptom experienced by many patients with rheumatologic disorders, is highly co-morbid with migraine, and has been associated with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.  As the name suggests, the primary symptom of the condition, also known as CFS, is debilitating fatigue, of both physical and mental nature.  As a result of the publication of the preliminary results from the trial in pSS described above, multiple clinicians have reached out to us asking to conduct IITs among CFS patients who experience migraine. We have initially elected to partner with one clinician to study the effects of gammaCore in this patient population and will assess the opportunity once the trial is completed. 
 Fibromyalgia. In 2011, a paper was published reporting on the results of an open-label pilot trial of implanted VNS used to treat severe fibromyalgia patients. In the trial, 14 patients were implanted with the VNS stimulators, 12 patients of whom completed the initial 3-month protocol and provided data; and 11 of whom returned for follow-up visits at 5, 8, and 11 months after initiation of stimulation. The researchers reported therapeutic efficacy based on an a priori set of stringent composite measures of improved pain, overall wellness, and physical function. Loss of both pain and tenderness criteria for the diagnosis of FM were also reported as post hoc analyses based on the unexpectedly positive results observed after 3 months of stimulation.  More specifically, at three months, five of the 12 patients had attained the stringent efficacy criteria for success; and of these, two patients no longer met widespread pain or tenderness criteria for the diagnosis of FM; a result not previously observed for any therapy for fibromyalgia. The therapeutic effect seemed to increase over time in that additional participants attained both criteria at 11 months.
 Based upon these findings, the fact that nearly 80% of fibromyalgia patients experience migraine and fatigue as frequent symptoms, as well as observations made among a cohort of nearly 1,000 patients who were invited to trial gammaCore for up to 96 weeks in the United Kingdom from 2013 through 2016, we have elected to sponsor a multi-centered, randomized, sham-controlled trial of gammaCore for the treatment of fibromyalgia, which is expected to begin enrollment during the first half of 2019.
 
Manufacturing 
 We are the FDA-registered manufacturer of our gammaCore Sapphire and related products. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers, located both within and outside the United States, for substantially all of the components of our gammaCore products, including the handheld stimulator assembly, charging case, RFID cards and conductive gel. 
 At our facility in Basking Ridge, NJ, we inspect inbound component parts to ensure they meet our design and manufacturing specifications. This quality process involves physical inspection and electrical performance testing. After successful completion of this inspection, each gammaCore is configured to deliver our prescribed therapy, and a final test is performed on the unit to ensure it meets our performance specifications. At the time of configuration, each unit is programmed with a unique set of proprietary activation codes that will correspond to codes that are programmed onto RFID cards by our specialty pharmacy and delivered to the patient to activate and refill their therapy.  The unit is then packaged, along with appropriate labeling, instructions for use, an initial RFID card and conductive gel, and shipped into our distribution network. Each RFID card that will be programmed by the specialty pharmacy has its own unique pre-programmed authorization code that is required to access our database of activation codes. 
 30

As of March 2019, our development and prototype shops were relocated to our new facility in Rockaway, New Jersey.  The relocation of manufacturing and related operations, including device assembly, inspection/testing, packaging, storage and shipping is expected to be completed prior to June 2019.  
 We currently have sufficient capacity, through our primary suppliers and contract manufacturer, to meet anticipated demand for our therapy for the foreseeable future. However, in order to protect against risk of supply chain disruption, we have qualified an approved secondary contract manufacturer, with respect to the handheld stimulator. Additionally, we retain the internal expertise and capabilities to perform all assembly aspects of our commercial product. These measures include purchasing a sufficient advanced supply of key components to reasonably assure that no component shortages will interrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver our products to patients on a timely basis. 
 The generation of our proprietary therapeutic signal does not require custom electronic components. Therefore, we believe long-term manufacturing, supply and quality agreements with electronic component suppliers are not necessary, as all the electronic components used in our products are either high-volume, non-custom commodity components, or are readily available from multiple vendors. The majority of these components have multiple sources, and the few with single-sources have been purchased with sufficient reserves to permit continued production while simple product design modifications can be made.
 Commercialization
 In July 2017, following our initial FDA clearance in CH, we began a year-long commercial registry, managed by four regional business managers in partnership with 40 of the top headache centers in the United States, to gather real-world experiences with gammaCore among CH patients, gain advocacy among 250 physicians, and to drive an initial 1,000 prescriptions into U.S. commercial payers.  By June 2018, when the registry program concluded, an additional 40 centers of excellence had requested inclusion in the program, and we hired an additional 10 territory business managers.  These efforts generated more than 5,000 prescriptions into commercial payers from more than 800 physicians, including approximately 3,300 prescriptions in the second quarter of 2018.  In July 2018, upon the successful completion of our initial public offering, we expanded our direct sales force to 32 representatives, who initiated a proactive outreach to more than 6,400 leading headache physicians.  In 2018, approximately 15,000 gammaCore prescriptions were written by more than 1,800 prescribing physicians, over 1,000 of whom were defined as regular gammaCore prescribers based on the frequency of their prescriptions.  This included approximately 4,400 prescriptions in the third quarter of 2018, and approximately 5,800 in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The increasing prescription volume helped us engage with payers, and to execute agreements with commercial and government payers for coverage of more than 50 million lives in the United States.  Even without formal reimbursement coverage having been initiated, in 2018 our sales activity generated just under one million dollars in net revenue.  In addition, we dispensed approximately $4.7 million in product sales value to patients through our patient voucher and co-pay assistance programs that are not reflected in the net revenue.  
Strategy and Implementation
 Our commercial strategy has been focused on the following priorities: 
  
• | Drive advocacy of gammaCore as a leading headache therapy. Our advocacy strategy has been to establish gammaCore as a preferred treatment option in CH, and expand from that position into migraine. The core of this strategy is our physician outreach, professional education, peer reviewed publications, and participation in national and global professional society meetings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2018, implementing our strategy included successful completion of our registry program, in which we developed advocacy for gammaCore among 800 key opinion leaders. We currently have over 2,000 unique prescribers, including in excess of 1,500 targeted clinicians and their staff who are trained on gammaCore use, as well as more than 500 physicians who have written prescriptions without direct sales support.  We have contracted with 50 national key opinion leaders, or KOLs, to serve as our gammaCore Faculty to lead a series of programs to educate their colleagues on our clinical data and our specialty pharmacy distribution process. Through the end 2018, these 50 KOLs conducted over 75 educational programs with over 700 attendees. In 2018, we participated at 60 professional society meetings, represented by corporate, medical, clinical and sales executives, including the top societies such as the American Headache Society Meetings, International Headache Congresses, and American Academy of Neurology.  At these global and national professional society meetings, we presented more than 30+ posters and/or presentations supporting clinical efficacy and safety of gammaCore across multiple indications and areas of therapeutic need.

• | Drive reimbursement of our therapy. Our strategy to secure reimbursement for gammaCore therapy across the majority of CH and migraine patients began 18 months prior to market entry, in early 2016, when we initiated pipeline presentations across the largest two-dozen commercial payers in the United States. Based on the gammaCore monthly prescription model, many payers indicated that we should advocate for reimbursement as a pharmacy benefit, especially among the pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, companies. It is typical for reimbursement from PBMs to come by way of rebate agreements, requiring the company to offer significant discounts, in the form of rebate payments, in return for gaining access to the PBM’s population of potential patients. Preferred positioning within the PBM’s system, which typically entails the product having the fewest restrictions and the lowest patient co-pay amounts, generally is provided to the companies providing the deepest discounts. It has been our strategy to identify the necessary rebate levels to gain the appropriate access. In addition, we are providing co-pay assistance to minimize the financial burden placed on the patient for filling the prescription. While we have been successful in negotiating several coverage agreements, and are currently in ongoing pharmacy benefit coverage negotiations with other payers, we have encountered some other payers, including the Federal government, who prefer to provide coverage for our therapy as a medical benefit. For these payers, negotiating reimbursement for gammaCore requires a different approach, in which the rebates are smaller or in some cases non-existent, and our support of the patient’s co-pay may need to be significantly higher, as medical benefit deductibles are typically much higher than those for pharmacy products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2018, our strategy focused on engaging, negotiating and securing agreements with the commercial payers and the components of the Federal government programs covering men and women aged 18 to 55, as these payers cover approximately 92% of patients experiencing migraines and cluster headaches.  Payers in the United States typically make coverage and reimbursement decisions with respect to new therapies based on three key factors: the strength of the therapy’s clinical data; observed patient demand; and the absolute and relative costs of the therapy.  
 To implement this strategy, our clinical and research teams published dozens of peer reviewed articles covering scientific and clinical trials of gammaCore.  These publications include the first publication of the PRESTO trial in Neurology in July 2018.  These publications have supported our initial commercialization efforts and have helped to drive the approximately 15,000 prescriptions written in 2018, the vast majority of which led to the patient claims necessary to prompt commercial payers to initiate clinical reviews and enter discussions over reimbursement.  To support our arguments for the cost effectiveness of gammaCore among CH and migraine patients, in 2018 we sponsored the publication of a series of supplements in the American Journal of Managed Care featuring articles focusing on the efficacy, cost, and impact on quality of life of gammaCore.  Collectively, these efforts supported our engagement with national and regional commercial insurance payers in the United States.  The goal of these engagements is obtaining reimbursement coverage as either a pharmacy benefit or medical benefit.  Our medical and marketing executives have negotiated multiple reimbursement contracts and secured medical policy amendments stating that gammaCore may be medically necessary for headache conditions, as opposed to investigational.  In December 2018, we secured a five-year Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, contract enabling us to sell gammaCore into the Veterans Hospitals and Department of Defense’s Military Treatment Facilities.
 As of January 2019, we have agreements or arrangements with commercial payers, one PBM and the FSS that we estimate provide for reimbursement for gammaCore as either a pharmacy benefit or medical benefit for approximately 53 million lives in the United States.  Although there can be no assurance of success, our payer access team is negotiating contracts with several additional insurance plans and PBMs covering approximately 90 million commercial lives in the United States, and in clinical review with plans covering an additional approximately 50 million lives in the United States.  With continuing payer discussions regarding up to an additional 90 million lives, we are seeking to expand the number of covered lives in the United States to 100 million in 2019.
  
• | Build a leading commercial presence. To establish a leading commercial presence, we adopted a four-part strategy comprised of: identifying the leading prescribing physicians providing secondary care to complex headache patients; engaging experienced sales specialists with deep knowledge of the target space and the physician community with whom they will be engaged; implementing a distribution platform and specialty hub supporting all aspects of the physician-patient-payer relationship, and creating a marketing engagement program to ensure that patients and physicians are aware of the value proposition of gammaCore.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32

In 2018, we executed on this strategy by identifying the 9,000 highest-prescribers of headache medications, who represent the top four decile of prescribing specialists in the field.  To adequately reach these physicians, we identified 44 territories, the first 32 of which cover 6,400 prescribers.  To fill the first 32 territories, we targeted experienced sales professionals with 10 or more years of pharmaceutical sales history, preferably in the headache, pain, and/or neurology field, who had demonstrated superior performance through receipt of national sales awards and recognition in prior positions. Leading these sales professionals are four regional leaders with more than 20 years of experience in sales and sales management roles.  Expansion of this sales force to cover the full 44 territories may be implemented based on the extent and nature of insurance coverage provided by payers for gammaCore.  We have also partnered with a telehealth company to make gammaCore available to patients nationwide through an online consultation.
 To ensure that physicians and patients experience a positive therapy initiation, we partnered with Asembia LLC, or Asembia, a specialty pharmacy hub service, to provide physicians and patients with concierge-like service. This service supports patient initiation and training through direct home-delivery of gammaCore, one-on-one training by a clinical professional, the gammaCore specialist, follow-up with the patient at 21 days to verify efficacy and assist with subsequent refill, and front-to-end support through the insurance claims adjudication process.  This concierge service also allows us to establish a unique relationship with physicians via real time information retained in our data warehouse which meets all HIPAA standards.  Understanding physician and patient concerns in real time allows our analytics and marketing teams to potentially adjust to our customers’ needs quickly.
 To ensure that patients and physicians are maximally aware of the value of prescribing gammaCore, in 2018 we expanded our digital presence by upgrading our gammaCore.com website and initiating a search engine optimization, or SEO, program driving web users searching for information on migraine and cluster headache to our website, providing the viewer key features and benefits information about our therapy.  In addition, we have provided key support and partnered with major patient advocacy organizations, including American Migraine Disorders, Healthy Woman, Cluster Busters, Miles for Migraine, BASH, and OUCH.
 Our Proprietary gammaCore Ecosystem
 We continue to seek to build advocacy among leading prescribing physicians, to negotiate to positive coverage decisions with payers to achieve coverage of 100 million lives in the United States by the end of 2019, and to build on our positive base of patients by raising awareness of the benefits of gammaCore as a treatment for severe headache conditions.  To accomplish these goals, we continue to integrate the experiences of stakeholders through our proprietary gammaCore ecosystem. A key feature of the highly connected ecosystem we have constructed is our HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based data warehouse. The web portal feature of this network enables unprecedented engagement with patients through which patients can get training and educational material, and diaries that provide patient support.  In the future, we may expand these programs to engage with patients through their smart phones, informing them of key information such as the distance they are from their gammaCore and the time to their next dose or refill.  We may explore incorporating additional features to allow smartphones to assist patients with identification and/or prediction of their risk factors and triggers. The portal plan is designed to promote patient engagement and the ability for the ecosystem to improve treatment outcomes. 
 The logistics of gammaCore distribution are significantly more efficient than that of traditional pharmaceutical therapies. Pharmaceutical therapies are typically distributed through a multi-tiered supply chain involving wholesalers, warehoused supply centers, and individual pharmacy branches, all of which separate the patient from the manufacturer. An important limitation of the traditional pharmaceutical distribution model is that manufacturers can only track prescriptions through the purchase of data from a third party, which is typically several months old, making real-time responsiveness impossible. Our system captures real-time information regarding the patient, therapy usage, and refill status. All sales and marketing data are completely current, and available at a maximally granular level, enabling real-time decision-making.
 By connecting our proprietary data warehouse directly to the specialty pharmacies that distribute our therapy, gammaCore’s distribution eliminates several tiers of the traditional supply chain. Each gammaCore can be refilled electronically through the delivery of unique digital authorization codes, which are maintained in this cloud-based warehouse. We provide these codes to these specialty pharmacies by permitting them access to our database, and to the patient through RFID cards programmed by the pharmacists we have trained. More specifically, following adjudication of the prescription and securing payment or payer authorization, these trained pharmacists are granted access to our cloud-based system and program an RFID card, in real-time, using a tablet computer that we provide. This digital warehouse has the capability to provide refill authorization codes directly from the warehouse to the patient through Bluetooth technology, further increasing the ease and efficiency of prescription refills by eliminating the need for RFID cards. 
 33

In October 2016, we entered into a non-exclusive master services agreement for the provision of specialty pharmacy distribution services in the United States with Asembia. Asembia provides us with access to its national network of specialty pharmacies and distribution services pursuant to one or more statements of work, or SOWs, arising under the agreement, including product stocking programs and integrated pharmacy dispensing systems, patient education and support, claims management and reimbursement assistance, professional compliance counseling and a patient hub services program with data capture and reporting capabilities. The agreement has an initial term of three years and is renewable automatically for successive one-year terms unless either party submits a termination notice at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current term. We may terminate the agreement or all or any part of any SOW at any time upon 90 days’ written notice to Asembia. The agreement may also be terminated for cause upon written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach that is uncured for 30 days following written notice of such deficiency. The agreement provides for customary transitional services in those instances where we elect to use another service provider or our own employees to perform the services. 
 Competition 
 While we believe that our proprietary gammaCore therapy provides us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other healthcare companies. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions are actively conducting research in overlapping fields of interest. Our gammaCore therapy will compete with existing therapies and therapies that may become available in the future. 
 We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of our therapy are its safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the availability of generic drugs and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
 Many of the companies we are competing with now, or with which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 In primary headache, we face competition from companies that develop and/or sell the following types of treatments: 
 Treatments for Cluster Headache 
 The most frequently used acute treatments for CH attacks are subcutaneous sumatriptan and inhaled oxygen. Alternative treatments include intranasal triptans and intravenous DHE. Only subcutaneous sumatriptan and intravenous DHE are approved in the United States for the acute treatment of CH. Currently gammaCore is the only FDA-cleared commercially available treatment for the prevention of CH, however, there are medications that are used off-label including verapamil, lithium, and valproate. 
Treatments for Migraine 
 The most frequently prescribed therapy for the acute treatment of migraine are oral or nasal triptans. Additional prescribed products include prescription strength NSAIDs.  There are currently three antibodies to CGRP and its receptor approved by FDA for the prevention of migraine by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Eli Lilly and Company, and by Amgen Inc., which is in a co-marketing partnership with Novartis International AG, approved by the FDA in May 2018. There are a number of medical devices that have been marketed for the treatment of migraine, including the Cefaly and the Spring TMS devices.  Small molecule CGRP receptor agonists are currently in Phase 3 development by Allergan plc and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the acute treatment of migraines. Certain classes of anti-epileptic medicine and beta-blocker medications have been approved by the FDA for the prevention of migraine. There is currently only one therapy approved for the prevention of chronic migraine, BOTOX marketed by Allergan plc.

Intellectual Property 
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology and products, proprietary processes and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”Patents and Patent Applications 
 As of February 1, 2019, we held more than 140 patents and patent applications, including more than 85 issued U.S. patents, more than 20 U.S. patent applications, and more than 45 international patents and applications. All of our current issued patents are projected to expire between 2026 and 2033. 
 More specifically, our current therapy embodies a number of critical proprietary innovations, including a patented high-frequency burst signal that is capable of passing comfortably through the capacitance of the skin. In addition, our therapy utilizes a patented low pass filtration that substantially eliminates high frequency harmonics that would otherwise activate pain receptors in the skin. The combined result is a mild sensation that activates the target fibers in the cervical vagus nerve. While physically possible to administer electricity through the skin of the neck that will activate the same vagal fibers without these innovations, the intensity of pain receptor activation makes it virtually impossible to do so without causing unacceptably high pain levels. 
 Additionally, we have pending claims covering the methods of treating various headache conditions using our innovative therapy. We also have claims covering our innovative distribution capabilities, including the remote network-enabled communication for delivery of neuromodulation therapy for a broad range of medical conditions. 
 The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. We cannot assure you that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or proprietary technologies may be alleged to infringe. 
 There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our gammaCore products, any of which could severely harm our business. 
 Copyrights, Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
 The software programs associated with gammaCore and our proprietary ecosystem are protected by U.S. copyright law. 
 As of February 1, 2019, our trademark portfolio consisted of seven U.S. trademark registrations, including electroCore®, gammaCore® and gammaCore, three pending U.S. trademark applications, including gammaCore Sapphire and gammaCare, and one registered European trademark, electroCore®.   
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may pursue licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment or term of service.

Government Regulation 
 United States 
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, guidance documentation, and standards. Our gammaCore products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, sale and advertising of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. Any violations of these laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or judicial interpretation, we may be required to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. 
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. 
 Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements. 
 Class III devices, consisting of devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. 
 510(k) Clearance 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. 
 36

Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. 
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacture documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 PMA Approval 
 A PMA must be submitted to the FDA for any device that is classified in Class III or otherwise cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process (although the FDA has discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process). PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA application, once the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will formally accept the application for review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180-days to review an “accepted” PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During the review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. 
 If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 In approving a PMA, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. 
 37

New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of a PMA-approved device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 
 De Novo Classification 
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or the FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo submission. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. 
 In March 2014 we filed a pre-submission package with the FDA requesting a meeting to discuss the viability of using the de novo pathway to gain authorization to commercialize our gammaCore product for an initial indication in CH. In June 2014, FDA met with us and confirmed that the de novo pathway would be appropriate for our submission. In October 2014 we filed our initial de novo submission with FDA. As is customary for many applications for commercial approval (Class II or Class III), FDA in a letter to us in May 2015 denied our initial application stating that our initial filing did not yet support a de novo clearance based on the information in the initial filing. In June 2015 we participated in an in-person meeting with FDA representatives to discuss the issues raised by the FDA in its May 2015 denial letter. In October 2015, based on our June 2015 meeting with FDA, we resubmitted our de novo submission with two proposed indications: (i) acute treatment of eCH; and (ii) prophylactic treatment of cCH. In February 2016, we received a letter from FDA indicating that our de novo submission, with some further requested re-analysis, included sufficient data to support de novo classification and clearance of gammaCore for at least one indication. We performed and submitted to the FDA the requested re-analysis in March 2016 and, following additional correspondence and meetings with FDA, in April 2017, FDA approved our de novo classification request and cleared our gammaCore therapy in the United States for the acute treatment of pain associated with eCH in adults. 
 Based on this approval, of our de novo classification request, gammaCore has been down classified to Class II under a new Class II device regulatory category for non-invasive cervical vagus nerve stimulators for the treatment of headache. The establishment of this category created a 510(k) regulatory pathway for the potential expansion of the gammaCore label to include acute treatment and/or prevention of pain associated with migraine and cCH, as well as acute treatment and/or prevention of other primary and secondary headaches. In January 2018, the FDA cleared gammaCore for acute treatment of pain associated with migraine headaches in adult patients, and we have conducted several additional clinical studies with a view to supporting additional label expansion. 
 Additionally, we anticipate utilizing the de novo classification process to obtain marketing authorization for our product candidates under development outside the headache field.

Clinical Studies 
 When FDA clearance or approval of a Class I, Class II or Class III device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board, or IRB, overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of Class III devices and may be required for Class I and II devices. The FDA or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the United States. 
Continuing Regulation 
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 
 
 
• | Product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved “off-label” uses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | notices of corrections or removals.
--+------------------------------------

 Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired. 
 Furthermore, our products could be subject to voluntary recall if we or the FDA determine, for any reason, that our products pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our gammaCore therapy would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. 
 39

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of some of our subcontractors. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to: 
 
 
• | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | recall, detention or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 To date, our facility has not been inspected by the FDA. 
 International 
 Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. 
 We received the CE Mark in Europe for our gammaCore therapy to treat, primary headache, including migraine, cluster headache, and hemicrania continua, as well as medication overuse headache in adults. We received the CE Mark for additional indications, including for the treatment or prevention of symptoms of reactive airway disease, which includes asthma, bronchoconstriction, exercise induced bronchospasm, and COPD in adults.
 In the EEA, gammaCore must comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to medical devices or the EU Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to gammaCore, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark medical devices manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the medical devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. 
 As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) 
 40

both clinical studies and scientific literature. With respect to Class III devices, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to obtain the required clinical data, unless reliance on existing clinical data from equivalent devices can be justified. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming. 
 Moreover, in May 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745) was adopted. The EU Medical Devices Regulation repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA Member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA Member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The EU Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020). Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things: 
 
 
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation in the jurisdictions in which we will conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, applicable anti-kickback, false claims, physician sunshine and patient privacy and security laws and regulations. 
 Anti-Kickback Statute: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, relieving a referral source of a financial or administrative burden and providing anything at less than its fair market value. In addition, longstanding OIG guidance makes clear that the opportunity for a referring physician to earn a profit, including through an investment in an entity for which he or she generates business, could constitute illegal remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce such referrals. 
 There are a number of narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain defined business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. Penalties for 
 41

violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, civil monetary penalties up to $74,792 (and adjusted for inflation) for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. 
 In the event that third-party payers require us to be a DME supplier or we sell our products directly to providers who are DME suppliers that submit claims to such payers, we may be subject to the federal Stark physician self-referral law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program, including DME, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, and prohibits that entity from billing or presenting a claim for the designated health services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral, unless an exception applies. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $24,253 (and adjusted for inflation) per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $161,692 (and adjusted for inflation) for a circumvention scheme. Various states also have corollary laws to the Stark Law, including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider. Both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state. 
 Federal Civil False Claims Act: The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain, payment of federal funds. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the civil False Claims Act in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Penalties for a federal civil False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between from $11,181 to $22,363 (and adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus treble damages, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. 
 Civil Monetary Penalties. The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier. 
 
Federal Healthcare Fraud Laws. Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also provide criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute (18 U.S.C. § 1347) prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. § 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996: The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 42

In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates and subcontractors, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA and HITECH. 
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,052 per failure up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Certain states also require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources. 
 EU Data Protection Legislation: We are subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the EU Data Protection Directive, as implemented into national laws by the EU member states, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Failing to comply with these laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became applicable on May 25, 2018 and replaced the EU Data Protection Directive. Unlike the Directive (which needed to be implemented by national laws), the GDPR is directly applicable in each EU Member State, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. The GDPR imposes stricter requirements and onerous accountability obligations on companies that process personal data, especially if they process sensitive personal data (such as data concerning health). Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR will be significant – up to € 20 million or 4% of global turnover, whichever is higher.  Implementation of the GDPR has influenced other jurisdictions to either amend, or propose legislation to amend their existing data privacy and cybersecurity laws to resemble the requirements of GDPR. For example, on June 27, 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CaCPA. CaCPA has been characterized as the first “GDPR-like” privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions in the GDPR. Because of this, we may need to engage in additional compliance efforts, including data mapping to identify the personal information we are collecting and the purposes for which such information is collected and enhanced consumer controls with respect to their data. This effort will need to be completed before the currently scheduled effective date of CaCPA on January 2, 2020.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payers and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products. 
 The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, which, through a series of legislative amendments, was suspended for 2016 through 2019, and which, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020; provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Moreover, the Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance beginning in 2019. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.

Glossary 
 “a7nAChR” refers to a receptor, specifically the alpha 7 nicotinic ACh receptor, that resides on the surface of many cell types, including macrophages and microglia, the dominant immune cell of the brain. Activation of this receptor by neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, has been shown to cause a change in the inflammation state mediated by these cells, which has led to this immune modulatory pathway being referred to as “the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway”, or “CAP”. 
 “ACh” means acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter released by certain neurons in the brain and by the vagus nerve. ACh is also released by a class of immune cells in response to certain stimuli. 
 “CAP” means the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which is an autonomic reflex that inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines involving signaling in the vagus nerve, the release of acetylcholine and the activation of alpha 7 nicotinic ACh receptors. 
 “CGRP” means calcitonin gene–related peptide, which is a protein produced by, and released by neurons. CGRP activates other neurons that are involved in pain perception. CGRP is also known to be a powerful vasodilator, causing dilation of blood vessels. 
 
“CH” means cluster headache, which is a headache disorder in which patients experience attacks of severe head pain, typically centered around the eye on one side, which occur from once every other day to eight times a day for a period that may last for a week, months or years. The attacks typically last 15 minutes to 180 minutes and the pain is typically associated tearing, eyelid dropping, sweating, congestion and/or runny nose. 
 “cCH” means chronic CH, which is a classification of CH defined by CH attacks occurring for more than one year without remission, or with remission periods lasting less than three months. 
 “CSD” means cortical spreading depression, which is a slow moving, self-propagated wave of depolarization of neurons and glial cells that spreads across the brain. 
 “eCH” means episodic CH, which is a classification of CH defined by CH attacks occurring in periods lasting from seven days to one year, separated by pain-free periods lasting at least three months. 
 “DAS” means disease activity score, which is an assessment used to measure rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity, to determine whether the signs and symptoms have reduced or stopped, and if treatment needs to be adjusted. 
 “DHE” means dihydroergotamine, which is a medication indicated for medically refractory migraine headaches. Its therapeutic activity has been attributed to activity against certain serotonin receptors, and has potent vasoconstricting effects on intracranial blood vessels. 
 “EEG” means electroencephalography, which involves the measurement and recording of electrical activity in the brain. 
 “functional magnetic resonance imaging” is an imaging technique that allows for, among other things, the measurement of brain activity through the detection of changes in blood oxygenation and flow that occur in response to neuronal activity. 
 “GABA” means gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is one of the primary inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. 
 45

“IL-1ß“means interleukin-1 beta, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in immune responses. 
 “LC” means locus coeruleus, which is a small region of the brainstem that is the sole source of norepinephrine in the brain. 
 “magnetoencephalography” is an imaging technique utilizing superconducting coils to measure the tiny magnetic fields generated by nerve activity within the brain from outside the skull. 
 “MTX” means methotrexate, which is an immunosuppressive medication, originally used in oncology, and now used widely as a first line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and related inflammatory disorders. 
 “nVNS” means noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation, which is a therapy employing the modulation of signals carried along certain fibers in the cervical vagus nerve which is achieved by the delivery of electric signals passed through the skin without physically penetrating the body. 
 “NRM” means the nucleus raphe magnus, which is a structure in the brainstem that is a major component in the endogenous pain inhibitory system and that produces and releases serotonin. 
 “PAG” means the periaqueductal gray, which is a structure in the brainstem that is a major component in the endogenous pain inhibitory system and that produces and releases the neurotransmitter GABA. 
“PTH” means post-traumatic headache, which is a headache condition resembling migraine that results from a traumatic head injury. 
 “RA” means rheumatoid arthritis, which is a common autoimmune disease characterized by chronic joint inflammation leading to pain, swelling, and ultimately the degeneration of cartilage and bone within the affected joint. 
 “SN” means the substantia nigra, which is a large midbrain structure that can be divided into two parts, one of which synthesizes and releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine, and the other of which synthesizes and releases the neurotransmitter GABA neurons. 
 “SPG” means sphenopalatine ganglion, which is a nerve bundle behind the bony structure of the nose that connects to the nerves in and around the eye socket. Activity in the SPG has been associated with CH. 
 “TCC” means the trigeminal cervical complex, which is a region of the brainstem that serves as a primary center and relay for pain, having inputs known to be associated with the generation and perception of head pain. 
 “TNF-a” means tumor necrosis factor alpha, which is a pro-inflammatory protein, or cytokine, involved in inflammatory events, and is associated with both the initiation and conclusion of inflammatory processes. 
 “VNS” means vagus nerve stimulation, which is a therapy involving the triggering of signals within certain fibers of the vagus nerve known to alter biologic function through the promotion of neurotransmitter release.
