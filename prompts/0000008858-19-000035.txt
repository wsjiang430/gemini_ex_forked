 Item 1. Business
 Avnet, Inc. (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global technology solutions company with an extensive ecosystem delivering design, product, marketing and supply chain expertise for customers at every stage of the product lifecycle. Avnet transforms ideas into intelligent solutions, reducing the time, cost and complexities of bringing electronic products to market around the world. Founded in 1921 and incorporated in New York in 1955, the Company works with over 1,400 technology suppliers to serve 2.1 million customers in more than 140 countries.
 For nearly a century, Avnet has helped its customers and suppliers realize the transformative possibilities of technology while continuously expanding the breadth and depth of its capabilities. Today, as technologies like the Internet of Things (“IoT”) continue to increase the complexity in product development, Avnet is once again redefining itself by offering what customers need to bring their product to life through one partner. Over the past few years, Avnet significantly enhanced its expertise in design, supply chain and logistics by acquiring the capabilities to better serve customers in the earlier stages of product development—encompassing research, prototyping and manufacturing—as well as acquiring expertise in software development, a critical component of an end-to-end IoT solution. These capabilities were acquired through the purchase of Premier Farnell (“Farnell”) (fiscal 2017), Hackster.io (fiscal 2017), Dragon Innovation (fiscal 2018) and Softweb Solutions (fiscal 2019). Avnet’s ecosystem, which combines these newly acquired capabilities with Avnet’s historical design, supply chain and integrated solutions capabilities, is designed to match its customers’ needs along their entire product development journey, providing both end-to-end and à la carte support options, as well as digital tools, to meet varying needs and buying preferences.
 Avnet can support every stage of the electronic product lifecycle and serves a wide range of customers: from startups and mid-sized businesses to enterprise-level original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). Avnet works with customers of every size, in every corner of the world, to guide today’s ideas into tomorrow’s technology.
 Organizational Structure
 Avnet has two primary operating groups — Electronic Components (“EC”) and Farnell. Both operating groups have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: (i) the Americas, Europe, (ii) Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and (iii) Asia/Pacific (“Asia”). Each operating group has its own management team that includes senior executives and leadership both at the global and regional levels, who manage various functions within such businesses. Each operating group also has distinct financial reporting that is evaluated at the executive level on which operating decisions and strategic planning and resource allocation for the Company as a whole are made. Divisions (“business units”) exist within each operating group that serve primarily as sales and marketing units to further streamline the sales efforts within each operating group and enhance each operating group’s ability to work with its customers and suppliers, generally along more specific geographies or product lines. However, each business unit relies heavily on the support services provided by the operating groups as well as centralized support at the corporate level.

 A description of each operating group is presented below. Further financial information by operating group is provided in Note 17 “Segment information” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Electronic Components
 Avnet’s EC operating group primarily supports high-volume customers. It markets, sells and distributes electronic components including semiconductors, interconnect, passive and electromechanical, or “IP&E,” components and other integrated components from the world’s leading electronic component manufacturers.
 EC serves a variety of markets ranging from automotive to medical to defense and aerospace. It offers an array of customer support options throughout the entire product lifecycle, including both turnkey and customized design, new product introduction, production, supply chain, logistics and post-sales services.
 Design Chain Solutions
 EC offers design chain support that provides engineers with a host of technical design solutions, which helps EC support a broad range of customers seeking complex products and technologies. With access to a suite of design tools and engineering support from any point in the design cycle, customers can get product specifications along with evaluation kits and reference designs that enable a broad range of applications from concept through detailed design including new product introduction. EC also offers engineering and technical resources deployed globally to support product design, bill of materials development, and technical education and training. By utilizing EC’s design chain support, customers can optimize their component selection and accelerate their time to market.

 Farnell
 Avnet’s Farnell operating group supports primarily lower-volume customers that need electronic components quickly to develop, prototype and test their products. It distributes a comprehensive portfolio of kits, tools, electronic components and industrial automation components, as well as test and measurement products to both engineers and entrepreneurs. Farnell brings the latest products, services and development trends all together in element14, an industry-leading online community where engineers collaborate to solve one another’s design challenges. In element14, members get consolidated information on new technologies as well as access to experts and product specifications. Members can see what other engineers are working on, learn from online training and get the help they need to optimize their own designs. Major Products
 One of Avnet’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products it distributes. Texas Instruments products accounted for approximately 10% of the Company’s sales during fiscal 2019, and 11% of the Company’s sales during fiscal 2018 and 2017, and was the only supplier from which sales of its products exceeded 10% of consolidated sales. Listed in the table below are the major product categories and the Company’s approximate sales of each during the past three fiscal years. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified between major product categories to conform to the fiscal 2019 classification. Other consists primarily of test and measurement as well as maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products.

  Competition & Markets
 The electronic components industry continues to be extremely competitive. The Company’s major competitors include: Arrow Electronics, Inc., Future Electronics, World Peace Group, Mouser Electronics and Digi-Key Electronics. There are also certain smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower regions, markets, products or particular sectors. As a result of these factors, Avnet must remain competitive in its pricing of products.
 A key competitive factor in the electronic component distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount and selection of inventory to meet customers’ rapid delivery requirements. To minimize its exposure related to inventory on hand, the majority of the Company’s products are purchased pursuant to non-exclusive distributor agreements, which typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion. These agreements are generally cancelable upon 30 to 180 days’ notice and, in most cases, provide for or require inventory return privileges upon cancellation. In fiscal 2017, certain suppliers terminated their distribution agreements with the Company, which did not result in any significant inventory write-downs as a result of such terminations. In addition, the Company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value-added services, which are tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs, such as point of use replenishment, testing, assembly, supply chain management and materials management.

 A competitive advantage is the breadth of the Company’s supplier product line card. Because of the number of Avnet’s suppliers, many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from Avnet, rather than purchasing from several different parties.
 Seasonality
 Historically, Avnet’s business and continuing operations has not been materially impacted by seasonality, with the exception of an impact on consolidated results from shifts in regional sales trends from Asia in the first half of a fiscal year to the Americas and EMEA regions in the second half of a fiscal year.   Number of Employees
 At June 29, 2019, Avnet had approximately 15,500 employees compared to 15,400 employees at June 30, 2018, and 15,700 employees at July 1, 2017.
