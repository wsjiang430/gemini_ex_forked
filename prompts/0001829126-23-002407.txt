Description of Business
 
C2E Energy, Inc. (‘the Company”) f/k/as Odyssey Oil & Energy, Inc. was formed in Florida in August 2001 with the plan of becoming a direct marketing company that developed and marketed premium-quality, premium-priced, branded fitness, and exercise equipment to the home fitness equipment market. The original business plan included marketing products directly to consumers through a variety of direct marketing channels.
 
As an initial step, the Company licensed the rights to a portable gym subject to patent protection in the United States, which was eligible to be marketed under the trademark Better Buns. It was the Company’s intention for this product to be its first direct-marketed product. The Company was unsuccessful in its attempts to raise funding to pursue this goal and in May 2005, received notice that it was in breach of its license agreement for the Better Buns product and that the license was being terminated. Since inception to date, the Company has not generated any revenues through the sale of the Better Buns product or otherwise and has not engaged in any marketing activities due to limited funds and resources.
 
In September 2005, the Company changed focus in connection with the Merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and CardioBioMedical Corporation (“CBM”), a Delaware corporation. The subsidiary merged with and into CBM, with CBM as the surviving corporation which became a subsidiary of the Company. The consideration for the merger consisted of 66,232,527 shares of the Company common stock, $.0001 par value, payable on a one-for-one basis to the consenting shareholders of CBM and a warrant, exercisable beginning January 1, 2008, to purchase 19,500,000 shares of the Company common stock at a purchase price of $.003 per share payable to the sole warrant holder of CBM in exchange for an equivalent CBM warrant.
 
The new objective of the Company was to establish a medical device, the Cardio Spectrum Diagnostic System as the standard of care for the detection of early-stage ischemic heart disease. The Company’s strategy consisted of (i) attempting to obtain insurance reimbursement for the performance of the diagnostic test (ii) establish the device with cardiologists and (iii) finally gain acceptance and use by other physician specialties and hospitals. The Company was unsuccessful in its attempts to obtain insurance reimbursement and marketing CSD.
 
On April 21, 2006, we began the realization of our new strategy by purchasing a 10% working interest in oil and gas leases in Texas from Centurion Gold Holdings, Inc., a related public company.

Competition and Market Conditions
 
We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until such time as the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
