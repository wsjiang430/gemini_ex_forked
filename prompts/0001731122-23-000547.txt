Overview of The Semiconductor Industry
 
The semiconductor industry was formed in 1960 when the production of semiconductors became a viable option. The global semiconductor market has grown rapidly, from over $1 billion USD in 19641 to $527.88 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow from $573.44 billion in 2022 to $1,380.79 billion in 20292.
 
The application of semiconductors has expanded extensively from radio in the 1960s to crucial electronic components nowadays to all manufactured products with computing or power management capabilities, ranging from computers and personal electronics to automotive goods and heavy machinery. Semiconductor devices mounted inside many electronics appliances are important electronic components that support our everyday lives.
 
Integrated circuits (ICs) and electronic discrete components such as diodes (which are two-terminal electronic components that conduct current primarily in one direction) and transistors (which are devices possessing an amplification function) are made of semiconductors.

● | Consumer electronics: This comprises chips used in household appliances, LCD TVs, and gaming consoles. 
● | Industrial: This comprises chips used in scanning devices such as bar code scanners and point-of-sale terminals, medical devices such as patient monitors and ultrasound imaging, and power supply equipment. 
● | Automotive: This comprises chips used in electronic automotive components such as power steering and lighting. 
● | Military and civil aerospace: This is a specialized segment where integrated circuits related to a particular application are built. 

 
Advantage and Market Focus of the Company
 
Semiconductors are materials which have conductors (generally metals), and nonconductors or insulators (such as most ceramics), which have negligible conductivity. The conductivity of a semiconductor material may be altered in useful ways by the deliberate, controlled introduction of impurities into the crystal structure of the material to modulate its electrical, optical and structural properties. This process is known as “doping”.
 
Silicon (Si) is traditionally the most common semiconductor material. However, Si-based systems have proven to perform inadequately in high-power conversion applications. We described the applications where Si-based systems perform inadequately as the premium power switching device market, which was $571 million in 2018 and is projected to pass $5 billion by 20293.This growth is largely driven by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and the growing number of installations of renewables such as solar and wind power as well as increased demand for more efficient industrial motor drives.
 
The premium power switching device market is currently being pursued by the semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC). GaN-based systems outperform Si and SiC based systems in every way due to the superior material properties of GaN. However, today’s commercially available GaN devices are built in a way that is only useful in lower voltage applications. This is because to date, it has been proven difficult to process GaN using standard semiconductor processing methods which would allow for higher voltages. While GaN can be implanted with ions through doping process like any other semiconductor, unlike Si or SiC, the temperature required to activate the ions in GaN destroys the crystal, making implant and activate scheme impractical in the GaN material. The Company has developed proprietary technology that allows activation of dopants in the GaN. This proprietary technology allows GaN to be processed in a manner that for the first time makes high voltage GaN power switching devices viably manufacturable.
 
Because the Company has invented an approach to allow GaN power switches to compete at voltages currently served by SiC and Si, the Company expects that its GaN power products will completely overlap the current market for SiC power switching market. Furthermore, the Company expects that its GaN power products will exceed switching speeds and operating voltages currently attainable reliably with SiC.
 
GaN is both less expensive to produce and offers significant performance advantages over SiC in system efficiency and system size. Currently there are no GaN devices in the market with ratings more than 1,000 V, which will be our strength area, however, our products will address voltages as low as 650 V.

What Is A Switch-Mode Power Converter
 
Broadly speaking, switch-mode power converters are used to efficiently transform one voltage to another for the purpose of supplying power to and from different systems.
 
Simple case - Power converter (brick) converts power at 120 V wall plug to power to 18.5 V to safely charge laptops/phones:
 

Advanced case - Power converters charge 400 V batteries from 120 V wall plug / Power motor at 400 V from variable battery voltage / Charge batteries from regenerative braking to 400 V:

What Is A Power Switch
 
A power switch is a semiconductor device that can switch large voltages and currents at high frequency. It is the heart of any power converter. An ideal power switch presents little resistance in the “on” state, infinite resistance in the “off” state, and can switch between “on” and “off” at high speed with no stored charge.
 
Different semiconductor materials are better suited to making power switches. For a given operating voltage, GaN is 1000 times less resistive than Si, and 10 times less resistive than SiC. Lower resistance results in switches that reduce power loss. Moreover, GaN devices take up less area than Si or SiC, which lowers their capacitance, which allows a faster system switching speed.
 

Inductors and transformers typically are the largest components in the system. GaN based solutions are approximately 1/4 of the size of SiC based solutions. Smaller passive components are cheaper than larger variants because of the requirement of less materials such as copper.
 
The system size of a power converter is inversely related to the switching speed at which it operates. As switching speed increases, the size of the surrounding passive components become much smaller. GaN power converter circuits are approximately 4x smaller than SiC solutions for equivalent power ratings.

Furthermore, replacing SiC devices with GaN devices has the potential to reduce power loss by 40-70% compared to SiC. The diagram below compares the level of power losses with the use of Si, Sic and GaN based systems:
 

In summary, GaN-based solutions are smaller in size, cost less and yield greater efficiency comparing to Si-based or SiC-based solutions.
 
Comparing SiC and GaN Solutions for EVs
 
Our proprietary vertically conducting GaN devices are approximately 10 times smaller in chip size compared to devices fabricated from SiC, since the resistance of GaN is approximately one-tenth of that of SiC. As such, the cost of making vertically conducting devices is significantly lower than SiC devices.
 

The Company expects that a significant market exists for GaN solutions once high-voltage vertical GaN is commercially available, especially in the EV market. For example, there are 24 units of SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) used in each Tesla Model 3 module. There were over 800,000 Tesla Model 3 units delivered as of December 2020, which represents about 19,200,000 SiC MOSFETs. It is estimated that by 2025 each year there will be approximately 8.4 million EVs and 25 million HEVs to be sold[4].
 
In 2022, Yole provided the following forecast on the power SiC market that the market is growing at a 40% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) and will grow to over $6 billion by 2027. The largest segment in this market is for automotive (e.g., EV) and estimated to be over $5 billion in 2027. Our products will completely overlap those of SiC power devices and as such, our Total Available Market will be at least equal that of the power SiC market.

Competition and Challenges
 
There are many horizontal-conduction (meaning the current flows horizontally, along the surface of the wafer), high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) products emerging from industry. HEMT transistors are able to operate at higher frequencies than ordinary transistors, up to millimeter wave frequencies, and are used in high-frequency products such as cell phones, satellite television receivers, voltage converters, and radar equipment. However, horizontal-conduction device technology has difficulty scaling beyond 650 V.
 

In contrast to horizontal-conduction devices, vertical-conduction (meaning the current flows from the top surface of the wafer to the bottom surface) devices could easily have scaling beyond 650 V; however, there are currently few discrete parts available with ratings above 650 V, and none above 1,000 V. The Company believes it is uniquely poised to enter into the >1,000 V device market and above with its vertical conduction device technology.

We expect that our competitors will include a number of larger companies, particularly in the SiC area (such as STMicro, WolfSpeed, Texas Instruments (TI), Infineon, On Semiconductor, and etc.) which have more substantial research and development budgets than us. Even smaller companies which are more targeted in their development efforts, such as Nexgen Power Systems, Inc., may be our potential competitors. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our products or technologies may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
