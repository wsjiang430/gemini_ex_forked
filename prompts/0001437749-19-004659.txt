--------+-------------------------

Overview
 
Eagle Bancorp Montana, Inc. (“Eagle” or “the Company”), is a Delaware corporation that holds 100.0% of the capital stock of Opportunity Bank of Montana (“the Bank”), formerly American Federal Savings Bank (“AFSB”). The Bank was founded in 1922 as a Montana-chartered building and loan association and has conducted operations and maintained its administrative office in Helena, Montana since that time. In 1975, the Bank adopted a federal thrift charter and in October 2014 converted to a Montana chartered commercial bank and became a member bank in the Federal Reserve System. The Bank currently has 22 branch offices and 19 automated teller machines located in our market areas and we participate in the Money Pass® ATM network. The Bank also operates certain branches under the brand names Dutton State Bank, Farmers State Bank of Denton and The State Bank of Townsend.
 
On September 5, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with TwinCo, a Montana corporation, and TwinCo’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ruby Valley Bank, a Montana chartered commercial bank to acquire 100% of TwinCo’s equity voting interests. The merger agreement provided that Ruby Valley Bank would merge with and into Opportunity Bank of Montana and that TwinCo would merge with and into the Company. Ruby Valley Bank operated two branches in Madison County, Montana. The transaction provided an opportunity to expand market presence and lending activities, particularly in agricultural lending. The acquisition closed January 31, 2018, after receipt of approvals from regulatory authorities, approval of TwinCo shareholders and the satisfaction of other closing conditions. The total consideration paid was $18.93 million and included cash consideration of $9.90 million and common stock issued of $9.03 million.
 
We provide loan and deposit services to customers who are predominantly small businesses and individuals throughout Montana. We are a diversified lender with a focus on residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, commercial business loans and second mortgage/home equity loan products. In addition, we offer wealth management products and services through our wealth management division and financial consultants located in several of our markets.
 
The Bank is headquartered at 1400 Prospect Avenue, Helena, Montana, 59601. Investor information for the Company may be found at www.opportunitybank.com. The contents on or accessible through our website are not incorporated into this report.
 
The Bank has equity investments in Certified Development Entities which have received allocations of New Markets Tax Credits (“NMTC”). Administered by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the NMTC program is aimed at stimulating economic and community development and job creation in low-income communities.
 
Recent Developments
 
On August 21, 2018, Eagle entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Big Muddy Bancorp, Inc. (“BMB”), a Montana corporation and BMB’s wholly-owned subsidiary, The State Bank of Townsend (“SBOT”), a Montana chartered commercial bank to acquire 100% of BMB’s equity voting interests. On January 1, 2019, BMB merged with and into Eagle, with Eagle continuing as the surviving corporation. SBOT operated four branches in Townsend, Dutton, Denton and Choteau, Montana. The total consideration paid was $16.4 million, all of which was paid in Eagle common stock.

Business Strategy
 
Our principal strategy is to continue our profitability through building a diversified loan portfolio and operating the Bank as a full-service community bank that offers both retail and commercial loan and deposit products in all of its markets. We believe that this focus will enable us to continue to grow our franchise, while maintaining our commitment to customer service, high asset quality and sustained net earnings.
 
The following are the key elements of our business strategy:
 

● | Continue to diversify our portfolio by emphasizing our recent growth in commercial real estate and commercial business loans as a complement to our traditional single family residential real estate lending. As of December 31, 2018, such loans constituted approximately 65.56% of total loans;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to emphasize the attraction and retention of lower cost core deposits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seek opportunities where presented to acquire other institutions or expand our branch network through opening new branches and/or loan production offices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain our strong asset quality; and
--+---------------------------------------


● | Operate as a community-oriented independent financial institution that offers a broad array of financial services with high levels of customer service.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our results of operations may be significantly affected by our ability to effectively implement our business strategy including our plans for expansion through strategic acquisitions. If we are unable to effectively integrate and manage acquired or merged businesses or attract significant new business through our branching efforts, our financial performance may be negatively affected.
 
Market Areas
 
From our headquarters in Helena, Montana, we operate 22 full service retail banking offices, including our main office. Our other full service branches are located in Helena – Neill (opened 1987), Helena – Skyway (opened 2009), Bozeman – Oak (opened 1980, relocated 2009), Butte (opened 1979), Townsend (opened 1979), Montana. The Sterling Montana branch acquisition that was completed in 2012 included retail banking offices in: Bozeman, Big Timber, Livingston, Billings, Missoula and Hamilton. The Bozeman Mendenhall location was sold in June 2015, reconstructed by the new owners and we lease a portion of the new building. We opened a loan production office in Great Falls, Montana in 2015 and it transitioned to a full service branch in 2017. Our Great Falls branch moved to a new location in 2018. A branch in Billings Heights opened in 2017. The TwinCo acquisition in January 2018 included retail banking offices in Twin Bridges and Sheridan, Montana. The BMB merger in January 2019 included retail banking offices in Choteau, Denton, Dutton and Townsend, Montana.
 
Montana is one of the largest states in terms of land mass but ranks as one of the least populated states. According to U.S. Census Bureau data for 2010, it had a population of 989,415 (1.06 million estimated for 2018). Helena, where we are headquartered, is Montana’s state capital. It is also the county seat of Lewis and Clark County, which has a population of approximately 67,773 and is located within 120 miles of four of Montana’s other five largest cities: Missoula, Great Falls, Bozeman and Butte. Helena is approximately midway between Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. Its economy has shown moderate growth, in terms of both employment and income. State government and the numerous offices of the federal government comprise the largest employment sector. Helena also has significant employment in the service industries. Specifically, it has evolved into a central health care center with employment in the medical and the supporting professions as well as the medical insurance industry. The local economy is also dependent to a lesser extent upon ranching and agriculture. These have been more cyclical in nature and remain vulnerable to severe weather conditions, increased competition, both domestic and international, as well as commodity prices.
 
Butte, Montana is approximately 64 miles southwest of Helena. Butte and the surrounding Silver Bow County have a population of approximately 34,602. Butte’s economy was historically reliant on the mining industry and fluctuations in metal and mineral commodity prices have had a corresponding impact on the local economy.
 
 3


Bozeman is approximately 95 miles southeast of Helena. It is located in Gallatin County, which has a population of approximately 107,810. Bozeman is home to Montana State University and has experienced significant growth, in part due to the growth of the University as well as the increased tourism for resort areas in and near Bozeman. Agriculture, however, remains an important part of Bozeman’s economy. Bozeman has also become an attractive location for retirees, primarily from the West Coast, owing to its many winter and summer recreational opportunities and the presence of the University.
 
Townsend, Montana is approximately 34 miles southeast of Helena. Townsend is located in Broadwater County which has a population of approximately 5,936. Many of its residents commute to other Montana locations for work, particularly Helena. Other employment in Townsend is primarily in agriculture and services.
 
Livingston, Montana is approximately 124 miles southeast of Helena. Livingston and the surrounding Park County have a population of approximately 16,353. Livingston’s economy is somewhat reliant on wood products and tourism.
 
Big Timber, Montana is approximately 158 miles southeast of Helena. Big Timber and the surrounding Sweet Grass County have a population of approximately 3,691. Big Timber’s economy is somewhat reliant on the wood products, agriculture and tourism industries.
 
Billings, Montana is approximately 239 miles southeast of Helena. Billings and the surrounding Yellowstone County have a population of approximately 158,980. Billings is a significant trade center for eastern Montana. Select manufacturing is also a significant contributing portion of its economy.
 
Missoula, Montana is approximately 116 miles west of Helena. Missoula and the surrounding Missoula County have a population of approximately 117,441. The University of Montana is located in Missoula and the local economy is reliant on the University and the corresponding trade and services resulting from the University’s presence.
 
Hamilton, Montana is approximately 161 miles southwest of Helena in Ravalli County. Ravalli County has a population of approximately 42,563. Hamilton is a relatively short distance from Missoula with a number of persons working in Missoula, residing in Hamilton. Medical research and the wood products industry are significant contributors to Ravalli County’s economy.
 
Great Falls, Montana is approximately 91 miles northeast of Helena in Cascade County. Cascade County has a population of approximately 81,654. Health care, education services, and accommodation and food services are large contributors to Cascade County’s economy.
 
Twin Bridges, Montana is approximately 94 miles south of Helena in Madison County. Sheridan, Montana is approximately 103 miles south of Helena and is also in Madison County. Madison County has a population of approximately 8,175. Construction, health care and social assistance are significant contributors to the economy of Madison County.
 
Choteau, Montana is approximately 103 miles north of Helena in Teton County. Dutton, Montana is approximately 114 miles north of Helena and is also in Teton County. Teton County has a population of approximately 6,085. Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting along with health care and social assistance are significant contributors to Teton County’s economy.
 
Denton, Montana is approximately 179 miles northeast of Helena in Fergus County. Fergus County has a population of approximately 11,291. Agriculture, retail trade and construction are significant contributors to Fergus County’s economy.
 
Competition
 
We face strong competition in our primary market areas for retail deposits and the origination of loans. Historically, Montana was a unit banking state. This means that the ability of Montana state banks to create branches was either prohibited or significantly restricted. As a result of unit banking, Montana has a significant number of independent financial institutions serving a single community in a single location. While the state’s population is approximately 1.06 million people, there are 51 credit unions in Montana as well as 1 national thrift institution and 46 commercial banks as of December 31, 2018. Our most direct competition for depositors has historically come from locally owned and out-of-state commercial banks, thrift institutions and credit unions operating in our primary market areas. Competition in our primary market areas has increased in recent years. Our competition for loans also comes from banks, thrifts and credit unions, in addition to mortgage bankers and brokers. Our principal market areas can be characterized as markets with moderately increasing incomes, relatively low unemployment, increasing wealth (particularly in the growing resort areas such as Bozeman) and moderate population growth.

Lending Activities
 
General
 
The Bank originates residential 1-4 family, commercial real estate, home equity, consumer and commercial loans. Residential 1-4 family loans include residential mortgages and construction of residential properties. Commercial real estate loans include loans on multi-family dwellings, nonresidential property, commercial construction and development and farmland loans. Home equity loans include loans secured by the borrower’s primary residence. Typically, the property securing such loans is subject to a prior lien. Consumer loans consist of loans secured by collateral other than real estate, such as automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats. Personal loans and lines of credit are made on deposits held by the Bank and on an unsecured basis. Commercial business loans consist of business loans and lines of credit on a secured and unsecured basis and include agriculture production loans.
Fee Income
 
The Bank receives lending related fee income from a variety of sources. Its principal source of this income is from the origination and servicing of sold mortgage loans. Fees generated from mortgage loan servicing, which generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts, disbursing payments to investors and foreclosure processing for loans held by others, were $2.30 million and $2.13 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other loan related fee income for late charges and other ancillary fees were $172,000 and $174,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Residential 1-4 Family Loans
 
The Bank originates residential 1-4 family mortgage loans secured by property located in the Bank’s market areas. At December 31, 2018, $116.94 million or 18.92% of the Bank’s total loans were such loans. The Bank generally originates residential 1-4 family mortgage loans in amounts of up to 80.0% of the lesser of the appraised value or the selling price of the mortgaged property without requiring private mortgage insurance. A mortgage loan originated by the Bank, whether fixed rate or adjustable rate, can have a term of up to 30 years. The Bank holds substantially all of its adjustable rate and its 8, 10 and 12-year fixed rate loans in portfolio. Adjustable rate loans limit the periodic interest rate adjustment and the minimum and maximum rates that may be charged over the term of the loan. The Bank’s fixed rate 15-year and 20-year loans are held in portfolio or sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions. Generally, all 30-year fixed rate loans are sold in the secondary market. The volume of loan sales is dependent on the volume, type and term of loan originations.
 
The Bank derives a significant portion of its noninterest income from servicing of loans that it has sold. The Bank offers many of the fixed rate loans it originates for sale in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis. This means that we process the borrower’s payments and send them to the purchaser of the loan. This retention of servicing enables the Bank to increase fee income and maintain a relationship with the borrower. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $964.97 million in residential 1-4 family mortgage loans and $33.41 million in other loan categories sold with servicing retained. The Bank does not ordinarily purchase home mortgage loans from other financial institutions.
 
Property appraisals on real estate securing the Bank’s single-family residential loans are made by state certified and licensed independent appraisers who are approved annually by the Board. Appraisals are performed in accordance with applicable regulations and policies. The Bank generally obtains title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated. On occasion, refinancing of mortgage loans are approved using title reports instead of title insurance. Title reports are also allowed on home equity loans. Borrowers generally remit funds with each monthly payment of principal and interest, to a loan escrow account from which the Bank makes disbursements for such items as real estate taxes and hazard and mortgage insurance premiums as they become due.
 
The Bank also lends funds for the residential 1-4 family construction. Residential 1-4 family construction loans are made both to individual homeowners for the construction of their primary residence and, to a lesser extent, to local builders for the construction of pre-sold houses or houses that are being built for sale in the future. Residential 1-4 family construction loans accounted for $27.17 million or 4.40% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018.

Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
The Bank originates commercial real estate loans including loans on multi-family dwellings. Commercial real estate loans made up 41.54% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio, or $256.78 million at December 31, 2018. The Bank’s commercial real estate loans are primarily permanent loans secured by improved property such as office buildings, retail stores, commercial warehouses and apartment buildings. The terms and conditions of each loan are tailored to the needs of the borrower and based on the financial strength of the project and any guarantors. Generally, commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank will not exceed 75.0% of the appraised value or the selling price of the property, whichever is less. Commercial real estate loans are typically made with fixed rates of interest and 5 to 15-year maturities. Upon maturity, the loan is repaid or the terms and conditions are renegotiated. Generally, all commercial real estate loans that we originate are secured by property located in the state of Montana and within the market areas of the Bank. The Bank’s largest single commercial real estate loan at December 31, 2018 was a 50% participation loan originated by another bank in northwestern Montana. The Company’s share of the total outstanding loan at December 31, 2018 was $9.58 million and it is collateralized by commercial real estate located in Missoula, Montana. At December 31, 2018 this loan is performing in accordance with its repayment terms.
 
The Bank also lends funds for commercial construction and development. Commercial construction and development loans accounted for $41.74 million or 6.75% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. In addition, the bank originates loans secured by farm and ranch real estate. Farmland loans accounted for $29.92 million or 4.84% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018.
 
Home Equity Loans
 
The Bank also originates home equity loans. These loans are secured by the borrowers’ primary residence, but are typically subject to a prior lien, which may or may not be held by the Bank. At December 31, 2018, $52.16 million or 8.44% of our total loans were home equity loans. Borrowers may use the proceeds from the Bank’s home equity loans for many purposes, including home improvement, debt consolidation or other purchasing needs. The Bank offers fixed rate, fixed payment home equity loans as well as variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit. Fixed rate home equity loans typically have terms of no longer than 15 years.
 
Home equity loans are secured by real estate but they have historically carried a greater risk than first lien residential mortgages because of the existence of a prior lien on the property securing the loan, as well as the flexibility the borrower has with respect to the loan proceeds. The Bank attempts to minimize this risk by maintaining conservative underwriting policies on such loans. We generally make home equity loans for not more than 85.0% of appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral, less the amount of any existing prior liens on the property securing the loan.
 
Consumer Loans
 
As part of its strategy to invest in higher yielding shorter term loans, the Bank emphasized growth of its consumer lending portfolio in recent years. This portfolio includes personal loans secured by collateral other than real estate, unsecured personal loans and lines of credit and loans secured by deposits held by the Bank. As of December 31, 2018, consumer loans totaled $16.57 million or 2.68% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. These loans consist primarily of auto loans, RV loans, boat loans, personal loans and credit lines and deposit account loans. Consumer loans are originated in the Bank’s market areas and generally have maturities of up to 7 years. For loans secured by savings accounts, the Bank will lend up to 90.0% of the account balance on single payment loans and up to 100.0% for monthly payment loans.
 
Consumer loans have a shorter term and generally provide higher interest rates than residential loans. Consumer loans can be helpful in improving the spread between average loan yield and cost of funds and at the same time improve the matching of the maturities of rate sensitive assets and liabilities.
 
The underwriting standards employed by the Bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount.

Commercial Loans
 
Commercial business loans amounted to $59.05 million, or 9.56% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Agricultural production loans amounted to $17.71 million, or 2.87% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. The Bank’s commercial business loans are traditional business loans and are not secured by real estate. Such loans may be structured as unsecured lines of credit or may be secured by inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets. Agricultural operating loans are generally secured with equipment, cattle, crops or other non-real property and at times the underlying real property.
 
Commercial business loans of this nature usually involve greater credit risk than residential 1-4 family loans. The collateral we receive is typically related directly to the performance of the borrower’s business which means that repayment of commercial business loans is dependent on the successful operations and income stream of the borrower’s business. Such risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. In addition, commercial lending generally requires substantially greater oversight efforts compared to residential real estate lending.
 
Loans to One Borrower
 
Under Montana law, commercial banks such as the Bank, are subject to certain exemptions and are allowed to select the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) formula used to determine limits on credit concentrations to single borrowers to an amount equal to 15.0% of the institution’s total capital. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s limit to a single borrower was $15.02 million. Our largest aggregation of loans to one borrower was approximately $17.13 million at December 31, 2018. This consisted of four loans: two commercial real estate loans secured by two separate detention facilities, a commercial real estate loan secured by a chemical dependency treatment facility and a commercial loan. The first commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of $4.63 million at December 31, 2018. However, 80.0% of that amount, or $3.70 million at December 31, 2018 was sold to Montana Board of Investments, leaving a net principal balance payable to the Bank of $926,000. As of December 31, 2018, the principal balance on the second commercial real estate loan was $8.86 million. However, 90.0% of this loan is guaranteed by the USDA Rural Development. Thus, 90.0% of the loan, or $7.98 million at December 31, 2018, is not required to be included in the Bank’s limitations to a single borrower under applicable banking regulations. This leaves approximately $886,000 subject to the lending limit described above. The third commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of $3.62 million as of December 31, 2018. The commercial loan had a principal balance of $24,000 at December 31, 2018. As a result, the total amount subject to the lending limit at December 31, 2018 was $5.45 million. At December 31, 2018, these loans were performing in accordance with their terms. The Bank maintains the servicing for these loans.
Loan Solicitation and Processing
 
Our customary sources of mortgage loan applications include repeat customers, walk-ins and referrals from home builders and real estate brokers. We also advertise in local newspapers and on local radio and television. We currently have the ability to accept online mortgage loan applications and provide pre-approvals through our website. Our branch managers and loan officers located at our headquarters and in branches, have authority to approve certain types of loans when presented with a completed application. Other loans must be approved at our main offices as disclosed below. No loan consultants or loan brokers are currently utilized for either residential or commercial lending activities.
 
After receiving a loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report and verifications are obtained to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant’s employment, income and credit standing. When required by our policies, an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is undertaken by an independent fee appraiser. In connection with the loan approval process, our staff analyzes the loan applications and the property involved. Officers and branch managers are granted lending authority based on the nature of the loan and the managers’ level of experience. We have established a series of loan committees to approve any loans which may exceed the lending authority of particular officers or branch managers. Three Directors of the Board are required for approval of any loan, or aggregation of loans to a single borrower, that exceeds $2.50 million.
 
Loan applicants are promptly notified of the decision by a letter setting forth the terms and conditions of the decision. If approved, these terms and conditions include the amount of the loan, interest rate basis, amortization term, a brief description of real estate to be mortgaged, tax escrow and the notice of requirement of insurance coverage to be maintained. We generally require title insurance on first mortgage loans and fire and casualty insurance on all properties securing loans, which insurance must be maintained during the entire term of the loan.
 
 7


Loan Commitments
 
We generally provide commitments to fund fixed and adjustable-rate single-family mortgage loans for periods up to 60 days at a specified term and interest rate, and other loan categories for shorter time periods. The total amount of our commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2018, was approximately $18.75 million, all of which was for residential mortgage loans.
Investment Activities
 
General
 
State-chartered commercial banks such as the Bank have the authority to invest in various types of investment securities, including United States Treasury obligations, securities of various Federal agencies (including securities collateralized by mortgages), certificates of deposits of insured banks and savings institutions, municipal securities, corporate debt securities and loans to other banking institutions.
 
Eagle maintains liquid assets that may be invested in specified short-term securities and other investments. Liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending on the yields on investment alternatives. They may also be increased based on management’s judgment as to the attractiveness of yields available in relation to other opportunities. Liquidity levels can also change based on management’s expectation of future yield levels, as well as management’s projections as to the short-term demand for funds to be used in the Bank’s loan origination and other activities. Eagle maintains an investment securities portfolio and a mortgage-backed securities (“MBSs”) portfolio as part of its investment portfolio.
 
Investment Policies
 
The investment policy of Eagle, which is established by the Board, is designed to foster earnings and liquidity within prudent interest rate risk guidelines, while complementing the Bank’s lending activities. The policy provides for available-for-sale (including those accounted for under ASC Topic 825), held-to-maturity and trading classifications. However, Eagle currently does not hold any securities for purposes of trading or held-to-maturity. The policy permits investments in high credit quality instruments with diversified cash flows while permitting us to maximize total return within the guidelines set forth in our interest rate risk and liquidity management policies. Permitted investments include but are not limited to U.S. government obligations, government agency or government-sponsored agency obligations, state, county and municipal obligations, asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), investment grade corporate debt securities and commercial paper are also included. We also invest in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) overnight deposits and federal funds, but these instruments are not considered part of the investment portfolio.
 
Our investment policy also includes several specific guidelines and restrictions to ensure adherence with safe and sound activities. The policy prohibits investments in high-risk mortgage derivative products (as defined within the policy) without prior approval from the Board. To secure such approval, management must demonstrate the business advantage of such investments.
 
We do not participate in the use of off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments, except interest rate caps and certain financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges related to loans committed to be sold in the secondary market. Further, Eagle does not invest in securities which are not rated investment grade at time of purchase.
 
The Board, through its asset/liability committee, has charged the President and CEO with implementation of the investment policy. All transactions are reported to the Board monthly, as well as the current composition of the portfolio, including market values and unrealized gains and losses.
 
Sources of Funds
 
General
 
Deposits are the major source of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Borrowings are also used to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources. In addition to deposits and borrowings, we derive funds from loans and investment securities principal payments. Funds are also derived from proceeds for the maturity, call and sale of investment securities and from the sale of loans. Loan and investment securities principal payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while loan prepayments and deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and financial market conditions.
 
 8


Deposits
 
We offer a variety of deposit accounts. Deposit account terms vary, primarily as to the required minimum balance amount, the amount of time that the funds must remain on deposit and the applicable interest rate.
 
Our current deposit products include certificates of deposit accounts ranging in terms from 90 days to five years, as well as, checking, savings and money market accounts. Individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) are included in certificates of deposit.
 
Deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Helena, Bozeman, Butte, Townsend, Billings, Missoula, Livingston, Big Timber and Hamilton, and since the merger with Ruby Valley Bank, Twin Bridges and Sheridan. We believe we are able to attract deposit accounts by offering outstanding service, competitive interest rates, convenient locations and service hours. We use traditional methods of advertising to attract new customers and deposits, including radio, television, print media advertising and sales training and incentive programs for employees. Management believes that non-residents of Montana hold an insignificant number and amount of deposit accounts.
 
We pay interest rates on deposits which are competitive in our market. Interest rates on deposits are set by senior management, based on a number of factors, including: projected cash flow; a current survey of a selected group of competitors’ rates for similar products; external data which may influence interest rates; investment opportunities and loan demand; and scheduled certificate maturities and loan and investment repayments.
 
Borrowings
 
Deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes. However, as the need arises, or in order to take advantage of funding opportunities, we also borrow funds in the form of advances to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. We have Federal funds line of credits with FHLB of Des Moines, Pacific Coast Bankers Bank (“PCBB”), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”), United Bankers’ Bank (“UBB”) and Zions Bank. Our Federal funds line of credit with Stockman Bank was terminated during 2018.
 
In February 2017, the Company completed the issuance, through a private placement, of $10.00 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% fixed senior unsecured notes due in 2022. The interest will be paid semi-annually through maturity date. The notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company.
 
In June 2015, the Company completed the issuance of $10.00 million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes due in 2025 in a private placement transaction to an institutional accredited investor. The notes will bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 6.75% and interest will be paid quarterly through maturity date or earlier redemption. The notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The notes are recorded as long term debt for accounting purposes.
 
In September 2005, our predecessor entity formed a special purpose subsidiary, Eagle Bancorp Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”), for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities in the amount of $5.16 million. Our predecessor entity has issued subordinated debentures to the Trust, and the coupon on the debentures matches the dividend payment on the trust preferred securities. Upon the closing of the second-step conversion and reorganization, we assumed the obligations of our predecessor in connection with the subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities. For regulatory purposes, the securities qualify as Tier 1 Capital, while for accounting purposes they are recorded as long term debt. The securities have a 30-year maturity and carried a fixed coupon of 6.02% for the first five years, at which time the coupon became variable, at a spread of 142 basis points over 3 month LIBOR. At December 31, 2018 the rate was 4.228%.
 
Other Activities
 
The Company offers wealth management services at its locations through financial advisors employed by the Bank. Income from wealth management services was $536,000 and $624,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Subsidiary Activity
 
We are permitted to invest in the capital stock of, or originate secured or unsecured loans to, subsidiary corporations. The following are subsidiaries of the Company: Opportunity Bank of Montana, Eagle Bancorp Statutory Trust I, and AFSB NMTC Investment Fund, LLC, which is a subsidiary of the Bank.

As of December 31, 2018, we had 235 full-time employees and 14 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees to be good.
Regulation
 
Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to Eagle and the Bank. These descriptions of laws and regulations as well as those contained elsewhere do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Legislative or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations or financial condition.
General
 
As a state-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as the insurer of its deposits. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. There are periodic examinations to evaluate the Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. Under certain circumstances, the FDIC may also examine the Bank. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. Eagle, as a bank holding company, is required to file certain reports with, and is subject to examination by, and must otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. Eagle is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the federal securities laws. See “—Holding Company Regulation.”
 
Dodd-Frank Act

In July 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or require the issuance of implementing regulations, some of which have not yet been issued in final form. The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations have increased the regulatory burden, compliance cost and interest expense for Eagle and the Bank.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act will require the FRB to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks such as the Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.
 
The legislation also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts had unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. Lastly, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the FRB to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.

Federal Regulation of Commercial Banks
 
General
 
Deposits in the Bank, a Montana state-chartered commercial bank are insured by the FDIC. The bank has no branches in any other state. The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Montana Department of Administration’s Banking and Financial Institutions Division and the FRB. The federal laws that apply to the Bank regulate, among other things, the scope of its business, its investments, its reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature, amount of, and collateral for loans. Federal laws also regulate community reinvestment and insider credit transactions and impose safety and soundness standards.
 
The Bank’s general permissible lending limit for loans-to-one-borrower is 15.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10.0% of total capital, if the loan is fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion, but generally does not include real estate.
 
The federal banking agencies, have adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan, the appropriate federal banking agency may issue an enforceable order requiring correction of the deficiencies.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System
 
The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. FHLB Des Moines is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of banks, credit unions and savings institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain a specified amount of shares of capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines.
 
The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank’s FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank’s capital.
 
Federal Reserve System
 
The Federal Reserve System requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest-bearing reserves at specified levels against their checking and non-personal time deposits. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve System may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements.
 
The Bank has authority to borrow from the Federal Reserve System “discount window”. The Bank maintains a “primary credit” facility at the Federal Reserve’s discount window.
 
As a new member of the Federal Reserve System, the Company is required to maintain a minimum level of investment in FRB stock based on a specific percentage of its capital and surplus. A reduction in value of the Bank’s FRB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank’s capital.
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts

Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The Bank’s deposits, therefore, are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments paid to the FDIC by the Bank and other banking institutions are used to fund the FDIC’s Federal Deposit Insurance Fund.

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC
 
As insurer of deposits in banks, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving FRB an opportunity to take such action. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement with the FDIC. We are not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to the termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
 
New Assessments Under Dodd-Frank
 
The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on each insured institution quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories. The assessment base for calculating deposit insurance assessments is an institution's average total assets minus its average tangible equity (defined as Tier I capital). Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. The assessment rate schedule establishes assessments ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points. The FDIC may increase or decrease its rates for each quarter by 2 basis points without further rulemaking. In an emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment.
Minimum Reserve Ratios
 
The Dodd-Frank Act establishes 1.35% as the minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The FDIC had adopted a plan under which it would meet this ratio by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions, with assets less than $10 billion, of the increase in the statutory minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. During 2018 the DIF ratio reached 1.36%. Once the ratio hits 1.38%, the FDIC indicated it will automatically apply a small Bank’s credits to reduce its regular insurance assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment. In addition to the statutory minimum ratio, the FDIC must designate a reserve ratio, known as the designated reserve ratio, or DRR, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has established 2.0% as the DRR.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. There can be no prediction as to what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, through 2019, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund.
 
Capital Requirements

State chartered commercial banks, such as the Bank, are required by the FRB to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. These minimum capital standards include: a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 9.875%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 7.875%, a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.375%, or a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.00%. All of these ratios except for the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets include the capital conservation buffer of 1.875% phased-in beginning January 1, 2018. The regulations require that, in meeting the capital standards, institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for a national bank.
 
The risk-based capital standard requires state chartered commercial banks to maintain Tier 1 and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.875% and 9.875%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, recourse obligations, residual interests and direct credit substitutes, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0.0% to 100.0%, assigned by the FRB capital regulation based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Tier 1 capital is defined as common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. The components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock. Also included is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100.0% of core capital. The FRB also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements for financial institutions.

Basel III – New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules that revise and replace the current risk-based capital requirements in order to implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules include an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components and the calculation of risk-weighted assets.
 
Effective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more and banks like Opportunity Bank must comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which would consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5% which increased to 6.375% during 2018 with the capital conservation buffer of 1.875%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6.0% which increased to 7.875% during 2018 with the capital conservation buffer of 1.875%; (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8.0% which increased to 9.875% during 2018 with the capital conservation buffer of 1.875%; and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets (“leverage”) ratio of 4.0%.
 
The capital conservation buffer, when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement will be phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.
 
The federal bank regulatory agencies also implemented changes to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital ratios begin to show signs of weakness. These changes will take effect beginning January 1, 2015 and will require insured depository institutions to meet the following increased capital ratio requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.0%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%. See also the additional discussion below under “Prompt Corrective Action.”
 
Management believes that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were currently in effect; however, final rules are subject to regulatory discretion and could result in the need for additional capital levels in the future.
 
Prompt Corrective Action

Federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of undercapitalization. Generally, an institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of less than 8.0%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of less than 6.0%, a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of less than 4.5%, or a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of less than 4.0% is considered to be “undercapitalized.”  An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” An institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” Subject to a narrow exception, the FRB is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank that is “critically undercapitalized.”  Regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the FRB within 45 days of the date a bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. “Significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to more extensive mandatory regulatory actions. The FRB also could take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s capital ratios met the “well capitalized” standards.

Limitations on Capital Distributions
 
A principal source of the parent holding company’s cash is from dividends received from the Bank, which are subject to government regulation and limitation. Regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends in a manner that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. In addition, a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is subject to Montana state law and cannot declare a dividend greater than the previous two years’ net earnings without providing notice to the state. Additionally, current guidance from the FRB provides, among other things, that dividends per share on the Company’s common stock generally should not exceed earnings per share, measured over the previous four fiscal quarters. Basel III also introduces additional limitations on banks’ ability to issue dividends by imposing a capital conservation buffer requirement.
Transactions with Affiliates
 
The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” is limited by regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the FRB’s Regulation W. The term “affiliates” for these purposes generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution. Eagle is an affiliate of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of transactions, i.e. “covered transactions,” are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution’s capital. Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. In addition, banks are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no bank may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
 
Our authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10.0% or greater shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities controlled by these persons, is governed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, FRB Regulation O. Among other things, loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for bank-wide lending programs that do not discriminate in favor of insiders. Regulation O also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans that may be made to insiders based, in part, on the institution’s capital position, and requires that certain prior board approval procedures be followed. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these regulations.
 
Holding Company Regulation
 
General
 
Eagle is a bank holding company subject to regulatory oversight of the FRB. Eagle is required to register and file reports with the FRB and is subject to regulation and examination by the FRB. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over Eagle and its non-bank institution subsidiaries which also permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the Bank.
Mergers and Acquisitions
 
Eagle must obtain approval from the FRB before acquiring more than 5.0% of the voting stock of another bank or bank holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets. In evaluating an application for Eagle to acquire control of a bank, the FRB would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Eagle and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
Eagle obtained the necessary approvals from the FRB and the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions before acquiring TwinCo on January 31, 2018 and BMB on January 1, 2019.
 
 14


Acquisition of Eagle
 
Under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, a notice or application must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or a group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10.0% or more of Eagle’s outstanding voting stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of Eagle. In acting on such a notice or application, the FRB must take into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effect of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control will be subject to regulation as a bank holding company.
Federal Securities Laws
 
Eagle’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, filed with or furnished to the SEC, are available free of charge through our Internet website, www.opportunitybank.com, as soon as reasonably practical after we have electronically filed such material with, or furnished it to, the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. The contents on or accessible through, these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, our references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
