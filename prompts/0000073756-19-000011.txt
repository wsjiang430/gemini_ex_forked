GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Oceaneering International, Inc. is a global provider of engineered services and products, primarily to the offshore oil and gas industry. Oceaneering also serves the offshore renewables, defense, aerospace and commercial theme park industries. Oceaneering was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1969 out of the combination of three diving service companies founded in the early 1960s. Since our establishment, we have concentrated on the development and marketing of underwater services and products to meet customer needs requiring the use of advanced technology. We believe we are one of the world's largest underwater services contractors. The services and products we provide to the energy industry include remotely operated vehicles, specialty subsea hardware, engineering and project management, subsea intervention services, including manned diving, survey and positioning services, seabed preparation and asset integrity and nondestructive testing services. Our foreign operations, principally in the North Sea, Africa, Brazil, Australia and Asia, accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue, or $1.0 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our business segments are contained within two businesses – services and products provided primarily to the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the offshore renewables industry ("Energy Services and Products") and services and products provided to non-energy industries ("Advanced Technologies"). Our four business segments within the Energy Services and Products business are Remotely Operated Vehicles ("ROVs"), Subsea Products, Subsea Projects and Asset Integrity. We report our Advanced Technologies business as one segment. Unallocated Expenses are expenses not associated with a specific business segment. These consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans, including restricted stock and bonuses, as well as other general expenses.
Energy Services and Products. The primary focus of our Energy Services and Products business over the last several years has been toward increasing our asset base and capabilities for providing services and products for offshore operations and subsea completions. In recent years, we have focused on increasing our service and product offerings toward our oil and gas customers' operating expenses and the offshore renewable energy market.
During the past ten years, we have acquired businesses to expand and complement our service and product offerings. These include:

• | a Canadian manufacturer of clamp connectors, check valves and universal ball joints;


• | a Norwegian-based provider of inspection, maintenance, subsea engineering and field operations services, principally to the oil and gas industry;


• | a Norwegian rental provider of specialized subsea dredging equipment, including ROV-deployed units, to the offshore oil and gas industry;


• | a Norwegian oilfield technology company specializing in providing subsea tooling services and plugging, abandonment and decommissioning of offshore oil and gas production platforms and subsea wellheads;


• | a Norwegian design and fabrication company specializing in subsea tools for the offshore oil and gas industry;


• | a U.S.-based international provider of survey and positioning services;


• | a business that uses ROVs to perform surveys on mobile offshore drilling units and floating production systems that satisfy the underwater inspection in lieu of drydocking (UWILD) requirements of all major classification societies;


• | the assets of a provider of riserless light well intervention services;


• | a majority interest in an Azerbaijani company that supports the provision of ROV and diving services in the Caspian Sea region; and


• | a U.K. company that builds and operates tools for seabed preparation, route clearance and trenching for the installation of submarine cables and pipelines.

ROVs. We provide ROVs, which are tethered submersible vehicles remotely operated from the surface, to customers in the energy industry for drilling support and vessel-based services, including 
2

subsea hardware installation, construction, pipeline inspection, survey and facilities inspection, maintenance and repair. We design and build our new ROVs at in-house facilities, the largest of which is in Morgan City, LA. In 2018, we added six ROVs to our fleet and retired ten. Our work-class ROV fleet size was 275 at December 31, 2018, 279 at December 31, 2017 and 280 at December 31, 2016. We have decreased our ROV fleet size over the last four years as a result of lower market demand.
Subsea Products. Our Subsea Products segment consists of two business units: (1) manufactured products; and (2) service and rental. Manufactured products include production control umbilicals and specialty subsea hardware. Service and rental includes tooling, subsea work systems and installation and workover control systems, which we design and build but operate as a service.
We provide various types of subsea umbilicals through our Umbilical Solutions division from plants in the United States, Scotland and Brazil. Offshore operators use umbilicals to control subsea wellhead hydrocarbon flow rates, monitor downhole and wellhead conditions and perform chemical injection. Subsea umbilicals are also used to provide power and fluids to other subsea processing hardware, including pumps and gas separation equipment. 
In 2016, we acquired the assets of Blue Ocean Technologies, LLC, a privately held provider of riserless light well intervention ("RLWI") services. Subsea well intervention services are intended to maximize production and increase the recovery rate from offshore oil and gas reservoirs or, alternatively, prepare wells to be plugged and abandoned. These RLWI systems have the capability to perform a wide variety of cost-effective services for well interventions, including well diagnostics, damaged well remediation and workovers, and well plugging and abandonment. 
Subsea Projects. Our Subsea Projects segment consists of our subsea installation, inspection, diving, maintenance and repair services, principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola and India, utilizing a fleet consisting of two owned and one chartered dynamically positioned deepwater vessels with integrated high-specification work-class ROVs onboard, and four owned shallow water diving and survey vessels, other spot-chartered vessels and other assets. Our owned vessels are Jones Act-compliant. The dynamically positioned vessels are equipped with thrusters that allow them to maintain a constant position at a location without the use of anchors. They are used in the inspection, maintenance and repair of subsea facilities, pipeline or flowline tie-ins, pipeline crossings and installations. These vessels can also carry and install equipment or umbilicals required to bring subsea well completions into production (tie-back to production facilities). With our acquisitions of C & C Technologies, Inc. ("C&C") in 2015 and Ecosse Subsea Limited ("Ecosse") in 2018, further described below, we provide survey services and route clearance and trenching services. 
We previously had several deepwater vessels under long-term charter. The last of our long term charters expired in March 2018. With the current market conditions, our philosophy is to attempt to charter vessels for specific projects on a back-to-back basis with the vessel owners. This generally minimizes our contract exposure by closely matching our obligations with our revenue. Unless indicated otherwise, each of the chartered vessels discussed below is a deepwater multiservice subsea support vessel outfitted with two of our high-specification work-class ROVs. 
In 2012, we moved the chartered vessel Ocean Intervention III to Angola and also chartered the Bourbon Oceanteam 101 to work on a three-year field support vessel services contract for a unit of BP plc. We had extended the charter of the Bourbon Oceanteam 101 to January 2017. However, in early 2016, the customer exercised its right, under the field support vessel services contract, to terminate its use of the Bourbon Oceanteam 101 at the end of May 2016. Under the terms of the contract, the costs incurred by us associated with the early release and demobilization of the vessel were reimbursed by the customer. Following the release of the vessel, we redelivered it to the vessel supplier. The charter for the Ocean Intervention III expired at the end of July 2017. Under the field support vessel services contract, which was extended through January 2019 and subsequently renewed under a new contract through January 2022, we are continuing to supply project management and engineering services. We also provide ROV tooling and asset integrity services as requested by the customer. Chartered vessels and barges are provided to the customer upon request.

In March 2013, we commenced a five-year bareboat charter for a Jones Act-compliant multiservice support vessel, the Ocean Alliance, we have been using in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In January 2015, we commenced a two-year contract with a customer for the use of the Ocean Alliance which expired in January 2017. We returned the Ocean Alliance to the vessel owner in the first quarter of 2018 and continue to market the vessel, now renamed Cade Candies, for spot market work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on a back-to-back basis with the owner. 
In December 2013, we commenced a three-year charter for the Normand Flower, a multiservice subsea marine support vessel. We made modifications to the vessel and used the vessel in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to perform inspection, maintenance and repair projects and hardware installations. In December 2016, we declined our option to extend the charter and the vessel was released.
In November 2015, we commenced a two-year charter for the use of the Island Pride, a multiservice subsea marine support vessel. We used the vessel under a two-year contract to provide field support services off the coast of India for an oil and gas customer based in India. In November 2017, that field services contract expired and we declined our option to extend the vessel charter. 
We also charter or lease vessels on a short-term basis as necessary to augment our fleet.
In 2010, we acquired a vessel, which we renamed the Ocean Patriot, and we have converted it to a dynamically positioned saturation diving and ROV service vessel. We installed a 12-man saturation ("SAT") diving system and one work-class ROV on the vessel, and we placed the vessel into service in December 2011. 
During the third quarter of 2013, we signed an agreement with a shipyard for the construction of a subsea support vessel, to be named the Ocean Evolution. We expect to take delivery in the first quarter and place the vessel into service in the second quarter of 2019. We intend for the vessel to be U.S. flagged and documented with a coastwise endorsement by the U.S. Coast Guard. The vessel has an overall length of 353 feet, a Class 2 dynamic positioning system, accommodations for 110 personnel, a helideck, a 250-ton active heave-compensated crane, a working moonpool, and two of our high specification 4,000 meter work-class ROVs. The vessel is also equipped with a satellite communications system capable of transmitting streaming video for real-time work observation by shore personnel. We anticipate the vessel will be used to augment our ability to provide subsea intervention services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These services are required to perform inspection, maintenance and repair projects and hardware installations.
In 2015, we acquired C&C, now known as Oceaneering Survey Services, for approximately $224 million. Our survey business is a global provider of ocean-bottom mapping services, utilizing customized autonomous underwater vehicles, and provides marine construction surveys for both surface and subsea assets, as well as satellite-based positioning services for drilling rigs and seismic and construction vessels. It also provides near-shore survey services along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Mexico, and performs shallow water conventional geophysical surveys in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
In March 2018, we acquired Ecosse for approximately $68 million. Ecosse builds and operates seabed preparation, route clearance and trenching tools for submarine cables and pipelines on an integrated basis that includes vessels, ROVs and survey services. Enabling technologies acquired in the transaction include Ecosse's modular seabed system, capable of completing the entire trenching work scope (route preparation, boulder clearance, trenching and backfill), and its newly developed trenching system. These systems primarily serve the shallow water offshore renewables market.
Asset Integrity. Through our Asset Integrity division, we provide asset integrity management, corrosion management, inspection, and non-destructive testing services, principally to customers in the oil and gas, power generation, and petrochemical industries. We perform these services on both onshore and offshore facilities, both topside and subsea.
General. During the last five years, we have also made several small acquisitions to add complementary technology or niche markets. We intend to continue our strategy of acquiring, as opportunities arise, additional assets or businesses, to improve our market position or expand into related service and product lines.
4

Advanced Technologies. Our Advanced Technologies segment consists of two business units: (1) government; and (2) commercial. Government services and products include engineering and related manufacturing in defense and space exploration activities, principally to U.S. Government agencies and their prime contractors. Our commercial business unit offers a turnkey solution that includes program management, engineering design, fabrication/assembly and installation to the commercial theme park industry and mobile robotics solutions including automated guided vehicle technology to a variety of industries.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Energy Services and Products
Our Energy Services and Products business consists of ROVs, Subsea Products, Subsea Projects and Asset Integrity.
ROVs. ROVs are tethered submersible vehicles remotely operated from the surface. We use our ROVs in the offshore energy industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks, including drill support, vessel-based inspection, maintenance and repair, installation and construction support, pipeline inspection and surveys, and subsea production facility operation and maintenance. Work-class ROVs are outfitted with manipulators, sonar and video cameras, and can operate specialized tooling packages and other equipment or features to facilitate the performance of specific underwater tasks. At December 31, 2018, we owned 275 work-class ROVs. We believe we operate the largest fleet of ROVs in the world. We also believe we are the industry leader in providing ROV services for drill support, with an estimated 62% market share at the end of 2018.

ROV revenue: | Amount | | Percent of Total Revenue

MARKETING
Energy Services and Products. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures fluctuate from year to year. In particular, budgetary approval for more expensive drilling and production in deepwater, an area in which we have a high degree of focus, may be postponed or suspended during periods when exploration and production companies reduce their offshore capital spending. In recent years, we have focused on increasing our service and product offerings toward our oil and gas customers' operating expenses and the offshore renewable energy market.
We market our ROVs, Subsea Products, Subsea Projects and Asset Integrity services and products to domestic, international and foreign national oil and gas companies engaged in offshore exploration, development and production. We also provide services and products as a subcontractor to other oilfield service companies operating as prime contractors. Customers for these services typically award contracts on a competitive-bid basis. These contracts are typically less than one year in duration, although we enter into multi-year contracts from time to time.
In connection with the services we perform in our Energy Services and Products business, we generally seek contracts that compensate us on a dayrate basis. Under dayrate contracts, the contractor provides the ROV, vessel or equipment and the required personnel to operate the unit and compensation is based on a rate per day for each day the unit is used. The typical dayrate depends on market conditions, the nature of the operations to be performed, the duration of the work, the equipment and services to be provided, the geographical areas involved and other variables. Dayrate contracts may also contain an alternate, lower dayrate that applies when a unit is moving to a new site or when operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather or water conditions or other conditions beyond the contractor's control. Contracts for our product sales are generally for a fixed price.
Advanced Technologies.  We market our engineered products and services primarily to U.S. Government agencies and their prime contractors in defense and space exploration activities, and to domestic and international theme park operators, automotive manufacturers and retail warehousing. 
Major Customers. Our top five customers in 2018, 2017 and 2016 accounted for 39%, 40% and 43%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, four of our top five customers were oil and gas exploration and production companies served by our Energy Services and Products business segments, with the other one being the U.S. Navy or other parts of the U.S. Government, which is served by our Advanced Technologies segment. During 2018, revenue from one customer, Royal Dutch Shell, accounted for 10% of our total consolidated annual revenue and in 
7

each of 2017 and 2016, revenue from another customer, BP plc and subsidiaries, accounted for 12% and 18%, respectively, of our total consolidated annual revenue. 
Although we do not depend on any one customer, the loss of one of our significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
Most of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations, such as steel in various forms, copper, electronic components and plastics, are available from many sources. However, some components we use to manufacture subsea umbilicals are available from limited sources. With the exception of certain kinds of steel tube, where we are limited in the number of available suppliers, we can offer alternative materials or technologies in many cases, which depends on the requisite approval of our customers. Currently, we are experiencing limited steel tube availability, due to several large project requirements, coupled with suppliers having reduced capacity during the industry downturn. We believe we have secured sufficient steel tubes to satisfy existing backlog and anticipated orders to be produced in 2019. We believe the situation is temporary and will resolve itself as the industry returns to a more normal run rate.
COMPETITION
Our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments.
Energy Services and Products
We are one of several companies that provide underwater services and specialty subsea hardware on a worldwide basis. We compete for contracts with companies that have worldwide operations, as well as numerous others operating locally in various areas. We believe that our ability to provide a wide range of underwater services and products on a worldwide basis enables us to compete effectively in all phases of the offshore oilfield life cycle. In some cases involving projects that require less sophisticated equipment, small companies have been able to bid for contracts at prices uneconomical to us. Additionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete.
ROVs. We believe we are the world's largest owner/operator of work-class ROVs employed in energy related operations. At December 31, 2018, we owned 275 work-class ROVs, and we estimate that this represented approximately 25% of the work-class ROVs utilized in the oilfield service industry. We compete with several major companies on a worldwide basis and with numerous others operating locally in various areas.
Competition for ROV services historically has been based on equipment availability, location of or ability to deploy the equipment, quality of service and price. The relative importance of these factors can vary over time based on market conditions. The ability to develop improved equipment and techniques and to train and retain skilled personnel is also an important competitive factor in our markets. Demand for ROVs has been decreasing since mid 2014 due to the oil price environment, and our margins have decreased in recent periods due to lower utilization and pricing pressure, as price has become a more important factor in the current market environment.
Subsea Products. There are many competitors offering specialized products and services. We are one of several companies that compete on a worldwide basis for the provision of steel tube and thermoplastic control umbilicals, and compared to current and forecasted market demand, we are faced with overcapacity in the umbilical manufacturing market.
Subsea Projects. We perform subsea intervention and hardware installation services, principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, offshore Angola and the North Sea, from multiservice deepwater vessels. We are one of many companies that offer these services. In general, our competitors can move their vessels to where we operate from other locations with relative ease. Our survey and positioning services, along with our seabed preparation, route clearance and trenching services, operate in a 
8

similar competitive environment. We also have many competitors that supply commercial diving services to the oil and gas industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Asset Integrity. The worldwide asset integrity and inspection markets consist of a wide range of inspection and certification requirements in many industries. We compete in only selected portions of this market. We believe that our broad geographic sales and operational coverage, long history of operations, technical reputation, application of various pipeline inspection technologies and accreditation to international quality standards enable us to compete effectively in our selected asset integrity and inspection services market segments.
Advanced Technologies
Engineering services is a very broad market with a large number of competitors. We compete in specialized areas in which we can combine our extensive program management experience, mechanical engineering expertise and the capability to continue the development of conceptual project designs into the manufacture of custom equipment for customers.
SEASONALITY AND BACKLOG
We generate a material amount of our consolidated revenue from contracts for services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in our Subsea Projects segment, which is usually more active in the second and third quarters, as compared to the rest of the year. The European operations of our Asset Integrity segment are also seasonally more active in the second and third quarters. Revenue in our ROV segment is subject to seasonal variations in demand, with our first quarter generally being the low quarter of the year. The level of our ROV seasonality depends on the number of ROVs we have engaged in vessel-based subsea infrastructure inspection, maintenance, repair and installation, which is more seasonal than drilling support. Revenue in each of our Subsea Products and Advanced Technologies segments generally has not been seasonal.
The amounts of backlog orders we believed to be firm as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in millions):


 | As of December 31, 2018 | | As of December 31, 2017
 | Total | | 1+ yr* | | Total | | 1+ yr*
Energy Services and Products | | | | | | |

 *    Represents amounts that were not expected to be performed within one year.
No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts by the U.S. government.
PATENTS AND LICENSES
We currently hold numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications. We have acquired patents and licenses and granted licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.

REGULATION
Our operations are affected from time to time and in varying degrees by foreign and domestic political developments and foreign, federal and local laws and regulations, including those relating to:

• | operating from and around offshore drilling, production and marine facilities;


• | national preference for local equipment and personnel;


• | marine vessel safety;


• | protection of the environment;


• | workplace health and safety;


• | data privacy;


• | taxation;


• | license requirements for exportation of our equipment and technology; and


• | currency conversion and repatriation.

In addition, our Energy Services and Products business primarily depends on the demand for our services and products from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.
Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
Environmental laws and regulations that apply to our operations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (each, as amended) and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to the above-mentioned federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges, hazardous substances and waste, and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, primarily, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We cannot predict all of the environmental requirements or circumstances that will exist in the future but anticipate that environmental control and protection standards will become increasingly stringent and costly. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the "safe harbor" protection for forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords.
From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our company. These statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future orders, revenue, income and capital spending. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "plan," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "forecast," "budget," "goal," "may," "should," or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement.
In addition, various statements this report contains, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention are forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements appear in Part I of this report in Item 1 – "Business," Item 2 – "Properties" and Item 3 – "Legal Proceedings" and in Part II of this report in Item 7 – "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," Item 7A – "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated into Item 8 and elsewhere in this report. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, we disclaim any obligation to update these statements, and we caution you not to rely unduly on them. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following:
11


• | factors affecting the level of activity in the energy industry, including worldwide demand for and prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas production growth and the supply and demand of offshore drilling rigs;


• | decisions about offshore developments to be made by oil and gas exploration, development and production companies;


• | decisions about offshore developments to be made by offshore renewables companies;


• | the use of subsea completions and our ability to capture associated market share;


• | general economic and business conditions and industry trends;


• | the strength of the industry segments in which we are involved;


• | cancellations of contracts, change orders and other contractual modifications and the resulting adjustments to our backlog;


• | collections from our customers;


• | the levels of oil and gas production to be processed by the Medusa field production spar platform;


• | our future financial performance, including as a result of the availability, terms and deployment of capital;


• | the consequences of significant changes in currency exchange rates;


• | the volatility and uncertainties of credit markets;


• | changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretation by taxing authorities;


• | changes in, or our ability to comply with, other laws and governmental regulations, including those relating to the environment;


• | the continued availability of qualified personnel;


• | our ability to obtain raw materials and parts on a timely basis and, in some cases, from limited sources;


• | operating risks normally incident to offshore exploration, development and production operations;


• | hurricanes and other adverse weather and sea conditions;


• | cost and time associated with drydocking of our vessels;


• | the highly competitive nature of our businesses;


• | adverse outcomes from legal or regulatory proceedings;


• | the risks associated with integrating businesses we acquire;


• | the risks associated with the use of complex information technology systems, including cybersecurity risks and the risks associated with failures to protect data privacy in accordance with applicable legal requirements and contractual provisions binding upon us;


• | rapid technological changes; and


• | social, political, military and economic situations in foreign countries where we do business and the possibilities of civil disturbances, war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks.

We believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf. We have discussed most of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises. We advise our security holders that they should (1) be aware that important factors we do not refer to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.
