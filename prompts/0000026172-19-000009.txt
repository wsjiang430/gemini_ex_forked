SUPPLY
The performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. We are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain. This requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base, as necessary, to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers.
We use a category strategy process (a process designed to create the most value for the company) that reviews our long-term needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally. For the items we decide to purchase externally, the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with long-term to provide the best technology, the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance. We design and/or manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units, including cylinder blocks and heads, turbochargers, connecting rods, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, alternators, electronic and emissions controls, automated transmissions and fuel systems. We source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers. Many key suppliers are managed through long-term supply agreements that assure capacity, delivery, quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period. Approximately 20 percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers. We have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk. These processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness. Our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 90 percent of our direct material spend. As of December 31, 2018, our analysis indicates that we have approximately 80 percent of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources.
Other important elements of our sourcing strategy include:

• | working with suppliers to measure and improve their environmental footprint;


• | selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct; and


• | assuring our suppliers comply with Cummins' prohibited and restricted materials policy.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.
SEASONALITY
While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exceptions that our Power Systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia.
LARGEST CUSTOMERS
We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 14 percent in 2017 and 13 percent in 2016. We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty and mid-range engines. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2018. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have been an engine supplier to PACCAR for 74 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion.
In addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty and medium-duty engine supply agreements with Navistar and Daimler. We also have an agreement with Fiat Chrysler to supply engines for its Ram trucks. Collectively, our net sales to these four customers, including PACCAR, were 35 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 33 percent in 2017 and 33 percent in 2016. Excluding PACCAR, net sales to any single customer were less than 9 percent of our consolidated net 
11

sales in 2018, less than 7 percent in 2017 and less than 7 percent in 2016. These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
BACKLOG
We have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm. At December 31, 2018, we did not have any significant backlogs.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
In 2018, we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies, meet future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy.
Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, product extensions, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, technical IT, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project. We generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $894 million in 2018, $734 million in 2017 and $616 million in 2016. Contract reimbursements were$120 million, $137 million and $131 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
We adopted our comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 after examining our entire environmental footprint, focusing on the key areas of water, waste, energy and greenhouse gases (GHG). As the concept and scope of environmental sustainability has matured and broadened, leaders have moved from initially working on environmental impacts within our direct control in our operations to an expanded view of fuel and raw materials that reaches across the entire product life-cycle from design to manufacture to end of life. Our environmental sustainability plan is the way we carry out our priorities, goals and initiatives in our action areas, including reducing our carbon footprint, using fewer natural resources and partnering to solve complex problems.
The highest level of accountability for Cummins’ climate-related risks and opportunities is with the Safety, Environment and Technology (SET) committee of the Board of Directors. The Action Committee for Environmental Sustainability meets monthly and reports to the Chairman and to the SET committee at least annually.
Our Sustainability Progress Report for 2017/2018 includes goal progress and other key environmental and climate metrics and targets. This and prior reports as well as a Data Book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's Standard core compliance designation are available on our website at www.cummins.com. Our annual submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is also available on the website. This submission provides information on our scenario planning exercise for climate and other risks as requested by CDP. These reports and data book are not incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference. We currently have the following environmental sustainability goals and commitments:

• | a product vision statement — "powering the future through product innovation that makes people's lives better and reduces our environmental footprint;"


• | partnering with customers to improve the fuel efficiency of our products in use, targeting an annual run-rate reduction of 3.5 million metric tons of CO2;


• | achieving a 32 percent energy intensity reduction from company facilities by 2020 (using a baseline year of 2010) and increasing the portion of electricity we use derived from renewable sources;


• | reducing direct water use by 50 percent adjusted for hours worked and achieving water neutrality at 15 sites by 2020;


• | increasing our recycling rate from 88 percent to 95 percent and achieving zero disposal at 30 sites by 2020; and


• | utilizing the most efficient methods and modes to move goods across our network to reduce carbon dioxide per kilogram of goods moved by 10 percent by 2020.

We continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues. We are actively engaged with regulatory, industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as GHG and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally. We were named in the Top 25 in Newsweek's 2018 Green Ranking of U.S. companies, as well as named to the Dow Jones North American Sustainability Index for the thirteenth consecutive year in 2018 and given the highest scores possible in the 2018 inaugural ESG rating from Institutional Investor Services.

We strive to have robust certification and compliance processes, adhering to all emissions regulations worldwide, including prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of our products. We are transparent with all governing bodies in these processes, from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system, to test processes and results, and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required.
We work collaboratively and proactively with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear, appropriately stringent and enforceable, in an effort to ensure our products deliver on our commitments to our customers and the environment in real world use every day.
Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise. Over the past several years we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results.
EU and EPA Engine Certifications
The current on-highway NOx and PM emission standards came into effect in the European Union (EU) on January 1, 2013, (Euro VI) and on January 1, 2010, for the EPA. To meet the more stringent heavy-duty on-highway emission standards, we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology solutions and refined them for the EU and EPA certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines. We offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emission standards. Mid-range and heavy-duty engines for EU and EPA require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail fuel system, SCR technology, next-generation cooled EGR, advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The EU, EPA and California Air Resources Board (CARB) have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting the EU and EPA emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows.
In 2013, we certified to EPA's first ever GHG regulations for on-highway medium- and heavy-duty engines. Additionally, the EPA 2013 regulations added the requirement of on-board diagnostics, which were introduced on the ISX 15 in 2010, across the full on-highway product line while maintaining the same near-zero emission levels of NOx and particulate matter required in 2010. On-board diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes, service tool interface, in-cab warning lamp and service information availability. The new GHG and fuel-efficiency regulations were required for all heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in January 2014. Our GHG certification was the first engine certificate issued by the EPA and uses the same proven base engine with the XPI fuel system, variable geometry turbocharger (VGTTM) and Cummins aftertreatment system with DPF and SCR technology. Application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2017 GHG regulations.
The current EPA Tier 4 off-highway emission standards came into effect between the 2013 - 2015 time frame for all power categories. The current EU Stage V off-highway emission standards will come into effect between the 2019 - 2020 time frame for all power categories.  Engines designed for Tier 4 / Stage V standards were based on our extensive on-highway experience developing SCR, high pressure fuel systems, DPF and VGTTM. Our products offer low fuel consumption, high torque rise and power output, extended maintenance intervals, reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period, all while 
meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market. Our off-highway products power multiple applications including construction, mining, marine, agriculture, rail, defense and oil and gas and serve a global customer base.
Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations
Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2019. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations.
In the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites. 
Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites. In addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.
