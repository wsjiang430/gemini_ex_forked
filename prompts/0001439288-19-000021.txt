ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Our Company
Rexnord Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2006, is a growth-oriented, multi-platform industrial company with what we believe are leading market shares and highly-trusted brands that serve a diverse array of global end markets. We currently operate our business in two strategic platforms - Process & Motion Control and Water Management, both of which have expanded significantly by means of acquisitions of other companies or operations; see "Acquisitions and Divestitures" below for further information as to recent transactions. Our heritage of innovation and specification have allowed us to provide highly-engineered, mission-critical solutions to customers for decades and affords us the privilege of having long-term, valued relationships with market leaders. We operate our Company in a disciplined way and the Rexnord Business System ("RBS") is our operating philosophy. Grounded in the spirit of continuous improvement, RBS creates a scalable, process-based framework that focuses on driving superior customer satisfaction and financial results by targeting world-class operating performance throughout all aspects of our business.
Our strategy is to build the Company around global strategic platforms that participate in end markets with sustainable growth characteristics where we are, or have the opportunity to become, the industry leader. We have a track record of acquiring and integrating companies and expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions within our existing platforms that will expand our geographic presence, broaden our product lines, and allow us to move into adjacent markets. Over time, we may add strategic platforms to our Company. 
We believe that we have one of the broadest portfolios of highly engineered, mission and project-critical Process & Motion Control products for industrial, consumer goods, and aerospace applications worldwide. Our Process & Motion Control portfolio includes products and services used to safely, reliably and efficiently solve a wide range of demanding process and discrete automation and motion control applications. Our Water Management platform is a leader in the multi-billion dollar, specification-driven, commercial and institutional construction market for water management products and, to a lesser extent, the municipal water and wastewater treatment and residential construction markets. Our Water Management product portfolio includes building and site water management solutions that enhance water quality, safety, flow control and conservation.
Our products are generally "specified" or requested by end users across both of our strategic platforms as a result of our products’ reliable performance in demanding environments, our custom application engineering capabilities, and our ability to provide global customer support. Typically, our Process & Motion Control products are initially incorporated into products sold by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") or sold to end users as critical components in large, complex systems where the cost of failure or downtime is high, and thereafter replaced through industrial distributors as they are consumed or require replacement.
The demand for our Water Management products is primarily driven by new commercial and institutional building construction, the retrofit of existing structures (to make them more energy and water efficient) and, to a lesser extent, new infrastructure and residential construction. We believe we have become a market leader in the industry by developing innovative products that meet the stringent third-party regulatory, building, and plumbing code requirements and by subsequently achieving specification of our products into projects and applications.
We are led by an experienced, high-caliber management team that employs RBS as a proven operating philosophy to drive excellence and world-class performance in all aspects of our business by focusing on the "Voice of the Customer" process and ensuring superior customer satisfaction. Our footprint encompasses 44 principal Process & Motion Control manufacturing, warehouse, and repair facilities and 14 principal Water Management manufacturing and warehouse facilities located around the world which allow us to meet the needs of our increasingly global customer base as well as our distribution channel partners. 
Unless otherwise noted, "Rexnord," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" means Rexnord Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our fiscal year is the year ending March 31 of the corresponding calendar year. For example, our fiscal year 2019, or fiscal 2019, means the period from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019.

RBS
RBS creates a scalable, process-based framework that focuses on driving superior customer satisfaction and financial results by targeting world-class operating performance throughout all aspects of our business. RBS is based on the following principles: (1) strategy deployment (a long-term strategic planning process that determines annual improvement priorities and the actions necessary to achieve those priorities); (2) measuring our performance based on customer satisfaction, or the "Voice of the Customer;" (3) involvement of all our associates in the execution of our strategy; and (4) a culture that embraces Kaizen, the Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement. We believe applying RBS can yield superior growth, quality, delivery and cost positions relative to our competition, resulting in enhanced profitability and ultimately the creation of stockholder value. As we have applied RBS over the past several years, we have experienced significant improvements in growth, productivity, cost reduction and asset efficiency and believe there are substantial opportunities to continue to improve our performance as we continue to apply RBS.
Our Platforms 
Process & Motion Control 
Our Process & Motion Control platform designs, manufactures, markets and services a broad range of specified, highly-engineered mechanical components used within complex systems where our customers' reliability requirements and costs of failure or downtime are high. The Process & Motion Control portfolio includes motion control products, shaft management products, aerospace components, and related value-added services. Our products and services are marketed and sold globally under widely recognized brand names, including Rexnord®, Rex®, Addax®, Euroflex®, Falk®, FlatTop®, Cambridge®, Link-Belt®, Omega®, PSI®, Shafer®, Stearns®, Highfield®, Thomas®, Centa® and Tollok™. 
We sell our Process & Motion Control products and services into a diverse group of attractive end markets, including food and beverage, aerospace, mining, energy and power generation, cement and aggregates, forest and wood products, agriculture, petrochemical, marine, general industrial and automation applications. 
We have established long-term relationships with OEMs and end users serving a wide variety of industries. As a result of our long-term relationships with OEMs and end users, we have created a significant installed base for our Process & Motion Control products, which are consumed or worn in use and have a relatively predictable replacement cycle. We believe this replacement dynamic drives recurring maintenance, repair, and operations ("MRO") demand for our products. We estimate that approximately half of our Process & Motion Control net sales are to distributors, who provide an aftermarket channel to primarily serve OEM and end-user MRO demand generated by the installed base of our products through approximately 2,600 distribution points across 110 countries.
Most of our products are critical components in large scale manufacturing processes, where the cost of component failure and resulting down-time is high. Many customer facilities have a range of requirements and applications for multiple products across our expansive product portfolio. We believe our reputation for superior quality, reliability, application expertise, and ability to meet lead time expectations are highly valued by our customers, as demonstrated by their preference to specify and purchase Rexnord products when it is time to replace an installed Rexnord product, or "like-for-like" product replacements. We believe this replacement dynamic for our products, our focus on capturing first-fit installations, our significant installed base, and our global supply chain and manufacturing footprint enables us to achieve premium pricing, world-class customer satisfaction, recurring revenue generation, and a competitive advantage.
Water Management 
Our Water Management platform designs, procures, manufactures, and markets products that provide and enhance water quality, safety, flow control and conservation. The Water Management product portfolio includes professional grade water control and safety, water distribution and drainage, finish plumbing, and site works products primarily for nonresidential buildings. Our products are marketed and sold under widely recognized brand names, including Zurn®, Wilkins®, Green Turtle® and World Dryer®.
Over the past century, the businesses that comprise our Water Management platform have established themselves as innovators and leading designers, manufacturers and distributors of highly engineered products and solutions that control the flow, delivery, treatment and conservation of water to the institutional and commercial construction end markets and, to a lesser extent, the infrastructure and residential construction end markets. Segments of the institutional construction end market include government, healthcare, and education. Segments of the commercial construction end market include: lodging, retail, dining, sports arenas, and warehouse/office. Segments of the infrastructure end market include: municipal water and wastewater and transportation. The demand for our Water Management products is primarily driven by new commercial and institutional building construction, the retrofit of existing structures (to make them more energy and water efficient) and, to a lesser extent, new infrastructure and residential construction.

Our Water Management products are principally specification-driven and project-critical and typically represent a low percentage of the overall project cost. We believe these characteristics, coupled with our extensive distribution network, create a high level of end-user loyalty for our products and allow us to maintain leading market shares in the majority of our product lines. We believe we have become a market leader in the industry by meeting the stringent country specific regulatory, building, and plumbing code requirements and subsequently achieving specification of our products into projects and applications. The majority of these stringent testing and regulatory approval processes are completed through the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research at the University of Southern California, the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ("IAPMO"), the National Sanitation Foundation ("NSF"), the Plumbing and Drainage Institute ("PDI"), the Underwriters Laboratories ("UL"), Factory Mutual ("FM") and the American Waterworks Association ("AWWA") prior to the commercialization of our products. 
Our Water Management platform has an extensive sales and marketing network spanning approximately 30 countries, which consists of approximately 1,200 independent sales representatives across 220 sales agencies. Specifically, it has been our experience that, once an architect, engineer, contractor, or owner has specified our product with satisfactory results, that person will generally continue to use our products in future projects. The inclusion of our products with project specifications, combined with our ability to innovate, engineer, and deliver products and systems that save time and money for engineers, contractors, builders, and architects has resulted in growing demand for our products. Our distribution model is predicated upon maintaining high product availability near our customers. We believe that this model provides us with a competitive advantage as we are able to meet our customer demand with local inventory at significantly reduced lead times as compared to others in our industry.
Our Markets 
We evaluate our competitive position in our markets based on available market data, relevant benchmarks compared to our relative peer group, and industry trends. We generally do not participate in segments of our served markets that have been commoditized or in applications that do not require differentiation based on product quality, reliability and innovation. In both of our platforms, we believe the end markets we serve span a broad and diverse array of commercial and industrial end markets with solid fundamental long-term growth characteristics.
Process & Motion Control Market 
The market for Process & Motion Control products is very fragmented with most participants having single or limited product lines and serving specific geographic markets. While there are numerous competitors with limited product offerings, there are only a few national and international competitors of a size comparable to us. While we compete with certain domestic and international competitors across a portion of our product lines, we do not believe that any one competitor directly competes with us across each of our product line categories. The industry's customer base is broadly diversified across many sectors of the economy. We believe that growth in the Process & Motion Control market is closely tied to overall growth in industrial production which we believe has fundamental and significant long-term growth potential. In addition, we believe that through innovating to meet the changes in customer demands and focusing on higher growth end-markets, Process & Motion Control can grow at rates faster than overall United States industrial production.
The Process & Motion Control market is also characterized by the need for sophisticated engineering experience, the ability to design and produce a broad number of niche products with short lead times, and long-standing customer relationships. We believe entry into our markets by competitors with lower labor costs, including foreign competitors, will be limited due to the fact that we manufacture highly specialized niche products that are critical components in large-scale manufacturing processes. In addition, we believe there is an industry trend of customers increasingly consolidating their vendor bases, which we believe should allow suppliers with broader product offerings, such as ourselves, to capture additional market share.
Water Management Market 
The markets in which our Water Management platform participates are relatively fragmented with competitors across a broad range of industries, sectors, and product lines. Although competition exists across all of our Water Management businesses, we do not believe that any one competitor directly competes with us across all of our product lines. We believe that our served markets are growing long term at relatively strong rates, and that the growing demand for water conservation, quality, and safety can potentially support market growth above that of overall United States industrial production. We believe that we can continue to grow our platform at rates above the growth rate of the overall market and the growth rate of our competition, by focusing our efforts and resources towards end markets that have above-average growth characteristics.
We believe the areas of the Water Management industry in which we compete are tied to growth in commercial and institutional construction, as well as, to a lesser extent, infrastructure. We believe these areas have significant long-term growth fundamentals. Historically, the commercial, institutional and infrastructure construction sectors have been more stable and less vulnerable to down-cycles than the residential construction industry. Compared with residential construction cycles, downturns in infrastructure, commercial, and institutional construction have been shorter and less severe, and upturns have lasted longer and 
 6

had higher peaks in terms of spending as well as units and square footage. In addition, we believe that water management manufacturers with innovative products, like ours, are able to grow at a faster pace than the broader infrastructure, commercial, and institutional construction markets, as well as mitigate cyclical downturns in market growth.
The Water Management industry's specification-driven end-markets require manufacturers to work closely with engineers, contractors, builders, and architects in local markets to design specific applications on a project-by-project basis. As a result, building and maintaining relationships with architects, engineers, contractors and builders, who specify products for use in construction projects, and having flexibility in design and product innovation are critical to compete effectively in the market. Companies with a strong network of such relationships have a competitive advantage. Specifically, it has been our experience that, once an engineer, contractor, builder, or architect has specified our product with satisfactory results, that person often will continue to use our products in future projects.
Our Products
Process & Motion Control Products
Our Process & Motion Control products are generally critical components in the machinery or plant in which they operate, yet they typically account for a low percentage of an end user's total production cost. We believe, because the costs associated with a Process & Motion Control product failure to the end user can be substantial, end users in most of the markets we serve focus on Process & Motion Control products with superior quality, reliability, and availability, rather than considering price alone, when making a purchasing decision. We believe that the key to success in our industry is to develop and maintain a reputation for quality and reliability, as well as create and maintain an extensive distribution network, which we believe leads to a strong preference to replace products "like-for-like" while driving recurring MRO revenues and linking first-fit specifications to market share gain. Our leading Process & Motion Control brands include Rexnord®, Rex®, Addax®, Euroflex®, Falk®, FlatTop®, Cambridge®, Link-Belt®, Omega®, PSI®, Shafer®, Stearns®, Highfield®, Thomas®, Centa® and Tollok™. 
Motion Control Products
We are a leading manufacturer and supplier of highly engineered mechanical power transmission components used to affect and control material movement within heavy-duty process automation and discrete automation applications. Our motion control products include table top conveying chain and related accessories, metal conveying and engineered woven metals, gearing & gear drives, conveying equipment, industrial chain, and custom assemblies. Our FlatTop highly-engineered table top conveyor chain and related conveyor system accessories are used in discrete automation applications such as high-speed beverage-filling operations and is primarily sold to the food and beverage processing and packaging, consumer products, warehousing and distribution, automotive, and parts processing industries. Our gear drives reduce the output speed and increase the torque from an electronic motor or engine to the level required to drive a particular piece of equipment or an element of a larger mechanical system (such as a conveyor system). We produce a wide range of heavy, medium, and light-duty gear drives for bulk and unit material handling, mixing, pumping, and general gearing applications. Our conveying equipment components and industrial chain products are used primarily in heavy-duty process automation applications in numerous industries, including mining, construction and agricultural equipment, forest and wood products, cement and aggregates processing and hydrocarbon processing. 
Our Cambridge products provide users with metal conveying and engineered woven metal solutions, primarily used in food processing end markets, as well as in architectural, packaging and filtration applications. We also produce custom-engineered, application-specific miniature gearboxes and motion control assemblies and components that are supplied to a variety of end markets, including aerospace and defense, medical equipment, robotics, semiconductor, instrumentation, and satellite communications. 
Shaft Management Products
We are a leading manufacturer and supplier of highly engineered mechanical power transmission components used to control, support, and protect rotating shafts within machinery, process automation, and discrete automation applications. Rotating shafts transmit system power to the moving elements in machinery and equipment. Our shaft management products include couplings, torque limiters, electromagnetic clutches and brakes, industrial bearings, and shaft locking assemblies. Couplings are primarily used in high-speed, high-torque applications and are the interface between two shafts that permit power to be safely and efficiently transmitted from one shaft to the other. Torque limiters, clutches, and brakes are used in machinery applications to safely control shaft engagement and stopping. Industrial bearings are components that support, guide and reduce the friction of motion between fixed and moving machine parts. We primarily produce mounted bearings, which are offered in a variety of specialized housings to suit specific industrial applications, and generally command higher margins than unmounted bearings. Shaft locking assemblies are used to secure machine shafts to hubs through a mechanical interference fit that eliminates shaft backlash and improves transmission of high torques and axial loads. Our shaft management products are used in a wide range of end markets that include food and beverage, mining, energy and power generation, aggregates processing, pulp and paper, steel, chemical, forest and wood products, construction and agricultural equipment, marine, and general industrial and automation.

During fiscal 2018, we acquired Centa Power Transmission (Centa Antriebe Kirschey GmbH) ("Centa"), a leading manufacturer of premium flexible couplings and drive shafts for industrial, marine, rail and power generation applications.
Aerospace Components
We supply our aerospace components primarily to the commercial and military aircraft end markets for use in door systems, engine accessories, engine controls, engine mounts, flight control systems, gearboxes, landing gear and rotor pitch controls. The majority of our sales are to engine and airframe OEMs that specify our aerospace bearing and mechanical seal products for their aircraft and turbine engine platforms, often based on proprietary designs, capabilities, and solutions. We also supply highly specialized gears and related products through our aerospace-focused build-to-print manufacturing operations.
Water Management Products
Water Management products tend to be project-critical, highly-engineered and high value-add and typically are a low percentage of overall project cost. We believe the combination of these features creates a high level of end-user loyalty, reinforced by our investments in developing innovative new product solutions. Demand for these products is influenced by regulatory, building and plumbing code requirements. Many Water Management products must meet the stringent country-specific regulatory, building, and plumbing code requirements prior to the commercialization of our products (such as IAPMO, NSF, UL, FM, PDI and AWWA). In addition, many of these products must meet detailed specifications set by water management engineers, contractors, builders, and architects. Among our leading brands are Zurn® and Wilkins®.
Water Safety, Quality, and Flow Control Products
Our water safety, quality, and flow control products are sold under the Zurn and Wilkins brand names and encompass a wide range of valve products, distribution and drainage products, and site works products. Key valve products include backflow preventers, fire system valves, pressure reducing valves, and thermostatic mixing valves. These highly-specified and engineered flow control devices protect and control the potable water supply and emergency water supply within a building or site. Designed to meet the stringent requirements of independent test labs, such as the Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research at USC, NSF, UL and FM, they are sold into commercial, institutional, and industrial new construction and retrofit applications as well as the fire protection, municipal water and wastewater, and irrigation end markets.
Engineered water distribution solutions that protect human health and gravity drainage products that protect the environment are sold under the Zurn brand and are typically required in the early stages of a construction or retrofit project, when potable water and non-potable water distribution and drainage systems are installed. Specification drainage products include point drains (such as roof drains and floor drains), hydrants, fixture carrier systems, and chemical drainage systems that are used to control storm water, process water, and potable water in various commercial, institutional, industrial, civil, and irrigation applications. Water distribution products include PEX piping, valves, fittings, and installation tools. PEX tubing is manufactured from cross-linked polyethylene and is designed for high temperature and pressure fluid distribution piping applications for both potable water and radiant heating systems in the residential and nonresidential construction industries. These systems are engineered to meet stringent NSF and ASTM standards helping water professionals provide safe and efficient building and site water management solutions.
Site works products are commonly installed within a building or on a site to manage storm water and wastewater. Linear drainage systems are used to capture and direct storm water in a wide variety of commercial, institutional, industrial, and transportation infrastructure applications. Our wastewater pre-treatment products include oil and grease interceptors and separators, acid neutralization systems, and remote monitoring systems and are marketed under the Zurn and Green Turtle brands. Interceptors are used to separate and capture fats, oils, and greases from wastewater before it is discharged into the municipal wastewater collection system. Our proprietary designs are primarily fabricated from fiberglass reinforced polyester, which we believe is gaining market share from traditional concrete products due to its reliability, service life, ease of service, and lowest cost of ownership. Applications include restaurants and institutional food service operations, office buildings, hotels, entertainment venues, schools, grocery and convenience stores, airports, vehicle service garages, and fleet operations and maintenance facilities; acid neutralization systems are primarily used in schools, hospitals, and laboratories.

Water Conservation Products
Water conservation products are typically required in the latter stages of a construction or retrofit project, when interior spaces are being outfitted with fixtures, valves, and faucets. Zurn's finish plumbing products include manual and sensor-operated flush valves marketed under the Aquaflush®, AquaSense®, and AquaVantage® names and heavy-duty commercial faucets marketed under the AquaSpec® name. Innovative water conserving fixtures are marketed under the EcoVantage® and Zurn One® names. These products are commonly used in office buildings, schools, hospitals, airports, sports facilities, convention centers, shopping malls, restaurants, and industrial production buildings. The Zurn One Systems® integrate valve and/or faucet products with fixtures into complete, easily customizable plumbing systems, and thus provide a valuable time and cost-saving means of delivering commercial and institutional bathroom fixtures. The EcoVantage fixture systems promote water-efficiency and low consumption of water that deliver savings for building owners in new construction and retrofit bathroom fixture installations.
In fiscal 2018, we acquired World Dryer Corporation ("World Dryer"), a leading global manufacturer of commercial electric hand dryers. We believe that the combination of World Dryer’s eco-friendly hand dryers and Zurn's water-efficient plumbing products allows us to offer greater value to commercial building owners in the form of lower operating costs.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Mergers and acquisitions are a critical part of the Rexnord growth strategy. Our strategy is to build around our global strategic platforms by acquiring leading industrial manufacturing companies in attractive markets, with businesses that we believe will benefit from RBS to increase customer satisfaction, revenue growth and operating margins. In our last three fiscal years, we have completed several acquisitions within our Process & Motion Control and Water Management platforms focused on expanding our product portfolio and global presence in the end markets we serve; those acquisitions are further described below. The respective purchase prices for these transactions are stated net of cash acquired and excludes transaction costs. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for any of these acquisitions as the net effects were neither significant nor material to Rexnord’s results of operations or financial position.
Process & Motion Control

• | February 9, 2018 - We acquired Centa, a leading manufacturer of premium flexible couplings and drive shafts for industrial, marine, rail and power generation applications for a cash purchase price of $129.7 million plus assumed debt. The purchase price was comprised of $123.6 million paid at closing and $6.1 million of deferred purchase price payable in our fiscal 2020. Centa, headquartered in Haan, Germany, added complementary product lines to our existing Process & Motion Control platform. 

In completing the acquisition of Centa, we also acquired a non-controlling interest in two previously established joint venture relationships. On January 23, 2019, we acquired an additional 47.5% interest in one of these joint venture relationships for $21.4 million. As a result, we now hold a controlling interest in that entity and therefore the results of operations are consolidated within our consolidated financial statements subsequent to January 23, 2019.

• | June 1, 2016 - We acquired Cambridge International Holdings Corp. ("Cambridge"), which has operations in Cambridge, Maryland and Matamoros, Mexico. Cambridge is one of the world's largest suppliers of metal conveying and engineered woven metal solutions, primarily used in food processing end markets, as well as in architectural, packaging and filtration applications, for a cash purchase price of $213.4 million. 

Water Management

• | September 24, 2018 - We acquired certain assets associated with the design and distribution of various roof drains, spouts and flow sensors for institutional, commercial and industrial buildings for $2.0 million. The acquisition of these assets added complementary product lines to our existing Water Management platform and was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition of these assets did not materially affect our condensed consolidated statements of operations or financial position. 


• | October 4, 2017 - We acquired World Dryer, a leading global manufacturer of commercial electric hand dryers, for a cash purchase price of $50.0 million. This acquisition broadened the product portfolio of our existing Water Management platform and enables us to bring greater value to commercial building owners in the form of lower operating costs.

In addition to making acquisitions, we periodically review our operations to determine whether it would be in our interest to divest of certain non-core or non-strategic businesses. Information regarding divestitures within our Water Management platforms during recent fiscal years is included below.

• | November 26, 2018 - We sold the net assets of our VAG business within our Water Management platform pursuant to our previously disclosed plan to divest of this business. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of 

 9

$9.0 million at closing. All results associated with this business are presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Item 8, Note 4, Discontinued Operations for additional information.
Customers
Process & Motion Control Customers
Our Process & Motion Control components are either incorporated into products sold by OEMs or sold to end users for their MRO requirements either directly in certain regions or, more commonly, through industrial distributors as aftermarket products. While approximately 44% of our Process & Motion Control net sales are through our distribution partners, OEMs and end users ultimately drive the demand for our Process & Motion Control products. With approximately 2,600 distributor locations worldwide, we have one of the most extensive distribution networks in the industry. The largest of our Process & Motion Control industrial distributors, which is also our largest customer, accounted for approximately 8.6%, 9.2%, and 9.4% of consolidated net sales during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, our industrial distributors participate in the overall competitive dynamic in the Process & Motion Control industry. Industrial distributors play a role in determining which of our Process & Motion Control products are stocked at their distributor centers and branch locations and, consequently, are most readily accessible to MRO buyers, and the price at which these products are sold.
We market our Process & Motion Control products both to OEMs and directly to end users to create preference of our products through end-user specification. We believe this customer preference is important in differentiating our Process & Motion Control products from our competitors' products and preserves our ability to create channel partnerships where distributors will recommend Rexnord products to OEMs and end users. In some instances, we have established a relationship with the end user such that we, the end user, and the end user's preferred distributor enter into a trilateral agreement whereby the distributor will purchase our Process & Motion Control products and stock them for the end user. We believe our extensive product portfolio positions us to benefit from the trend towards rationalizing suppliers by industrial distributors.
Water Management Customers
Our water safety, quality, flow control, and conservation products are sold for new construction, remodeling, and retrofit applications to customers in our commercial construction, institutional, infrastructure, and residential construction end markets and are distributed through independent sales representatives, plumbing wholesalers, and industry-specific distributors in the waterworks, foodservice, industrial, janitorial, sanitation, and siteworks industries. Our independent sales representatives work with architects, engineers, building owners and operators, contractors, and builders, to specify our water safety, quality, flow control and conservation products for their use and with wholesalers to assess and meet the needs of building contractors in construction projects. They also combine knowledge of our products’ installation methods and delivery availability with knowledge of the local markets to provide contractors with value-added service. We use approximately 1,200 independent sales representatives, along with a network of regional distribution centers and third-party warehouses, to provide our customers with same-day service and quick response times. Zurn and Wilkins benefit from strong brand recognition, which is further bolstered by a strong propensity to replace "like-for-like" products.
In addition to our domestic Water Management manufacturing facilities, we have maintained a global network of independent sources that manufacture high quality, lower-cost component parts for our commercial, institutional, infrastructure, and residential products. These sources fabricate parts to our specifications using our proprietary designs, which enables us to focus on product engineering, assembly, testing, and quality control. By closely monitoring these sources and through extensive product testing, we are able to maintain product quality and be a cost-competitive producer of commercial and institutional products.
Product Development
The majority of our new product development begins with our extensive "Voice of the Customer" operating philosophy. We have a team of approximately 380 engineers and technical employees who are organized by product line. Each of our product lines has technical staff responsible for product development and application support. The Rexnord Innovation Center provides additional support through enhanced capabilities and specialty expertise that can be utilized for product innovation and new product development. The Rexnord Innovation Center is a certified lab comprised of approximately 30 specialists that offers testing capability and design support during the development process to all of our product lines. Our existing pipeline and continued investment in new product development are expected to drive revenue growth as we address key customer needs. 
In both of our Process & Motion Control and Water Management platforms, we have demonstrated a commitment to developing technologically advanced products within the industries we serve. In the Process & Motion Control platform, we had approximately 200 United States active patents and approximately 900 active foreign patents as of March 31, 2019. In addition, we thoroughly test our Process & Motion Control products to ensure their quality, understand their wear characteristics and improve their performance. These practices have enabled us, together with our customers, to develop reliable and functional Process & Motion Control solutions. In our Water Management platform, we had approximately 200 United States active patents and 
 10

approximately 100 foreign active patents as of March 31, 2019. Product innovation is crucial in the commercial and institutional plumbing products markets because new products must continually be developed to meet specifications and regulatory demands. Zurn's plumbing products are known in the industry for such innovation. 
In May 2017, we launched DiRXN™ (pronounced "Direction"), our digital enterprise initiative. DiRXN™ is an internet-based customer productivity platform based on the integration of innovative Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and e-commerce technologies with Rexnord's leading portfolio of tools, products and services. DiRXN™ directly connects customers to data and information that allows them to optimize productivity across all stages of their life cycles. During fiscal 2018 and 2019, we began adding Smart Tags to our Process & Motion Control and Water Management products in order to provide our customers with a direct digital link to asset information and digital support for the installation and maintenance of our products. We also began to deliver Process & Motion Control products with embedded sensors to collect real-time operational and contextual information regarding product performance, and we extended these capabilities to select Water Management products in our fiscal 2019. We have also introduced digitally-connected product solutions that can be retrofit to the installed base of our products. This information is used by our customers’ operations and maintenance staff through their facility and automation control systems and cloud-based portals to minimize unplanned system downtime and improve the productivity and safety of our customers’ operations.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
The principal materials used in our Process & Motion Control and Water Management manufacturing processes are commodities and components available from numerous sources. The key materials used in our Process & Motion Control manufacturing processes include: sheet, plate and bar steel, castings, forgings, high-performance engineered plastic and a variety of components. Within our Water Management platform, we purchase a broad range of materials and components throughout the world in connection with our manufacturing activities that include: bar steel, brass, castings, copper, zinc, forgings, plate steel, high-performance engineered plastic and resin. Our global sourcing strategy is to maintain alternate sources of supply for our important materials and components wherever possible within both our Process & Motion Control and Water Management platforms. Historically, we have been able to successfully source materials, and consequently are not dependent on a single source for any significant raw material or component. As a result, we believe there is a readily available supply of materials in sufficient quantity from a variety of sources to serve both our short-term and long-term requirements. Additionally, we have not experienced any significant shortage of our key materials and have not historically engaged in hedging transactions for commodity supplies. We generally purchase our materials on the open market. However, in certain situations we have found it advantageous to enter into contracts for certain commodity purchases. Although currently we are not a party to any unconditional purchase obligations, including take-or-pay contracts or through-put contracts, these contracts generally have had one to five-year terms and have contained competitive and benchmarking clauses to ensure competitive pricing. 
Backlog
Our backlog of unshipped orders was $373 million and $330 million as of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, approximately 6% of our backlog was scheduled to ship beyond fiscal 2020. Also, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this report for more information on the risks associated with backlog.
Seasonality
We do not experience significant seasonality of demand for our Process & Motion Control products, although sales generally are slightly higher during our fourth fiscal quarter as our customers spend against recently approved capital budgets and perform maintenance and repairs in advance of spring and summer activity. Our Process & Motion Control end markets also do not experience significant seasonality of demand.
Demand for our Water Management products is primarily driven by commercial and institutional construction activity, remodeling, and retrofit opportunities, and to a lesser extent, new home starts as well as water and wastewater infrastructure expansion. Accordingly, weather has an impact on the seasonality of certain end markets. With the exception of our remodeling and retrofit opportunities, weather is an important variable as it significantly impacts construction. Spring and summer months in the United States and Canada represent the main construction season for increased construction in the commercial, institutional, and infrastructure markets, as well as new housing starts. As a result, sales generally decrease slightly in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the first two quarters of the fiscal year. The autumn and winter months generally impede construction and installation activity.
Our business also depends upon general economic conditions and other market factors beyond our control, and we serve customers in cyclical industries. As a result, our operating results could be negatively affected during economic downturns. See Item 1A Risk Factors of this report for more information on the risks associated with general economic conditions.
Employees

collective bargaining agreements in the United States. The remaining two collective bargaining agreements have expiration dates in October 2019 and April 2020. Additionally, approximately 1,300 of our employees reside in Europe, where trade union membership is common. We believe we have a strong relationship with our employees, including those represented by labor unions. 
Environmental Matters
Our operations and facilities worldwide are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pollution and the protection of the environment, health and safety, including those governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to water, the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other materials, and the remediation of contaminated sites. A failure by us to comply with applicable requirements or the permits required for our operations could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions. 
Some environmental laws and regulations impose requirements to investigate and remediate contamination on present and former owners and operators of facilities and sites, and on a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for sites to which such parties may have sent waste for disposal. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, may be joint and several, resulting in one PRP being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. On occasion we are involved in such investigations and/or cleanup, and also have been or could be named as a PRP in environmental matters.
