Completed portion of the pattern:
 

The above basic pattern will be generated through our pattern generator with constantly varied variables and spread over the product surface as below. The patterns are generated before usage and kept in the server to be issued when needed. All patterns will be unique due to its varied coordinates, and the usage of each code can be tracked individually.

The coordinate dot patterns are processed through 7 steps:
 

1. | Recognition of pattern through device 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A. | Software will limit amount data captured through camera 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


B. | Frameware configurations will enhance recognition 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Captured data will be filtered for better recognition of location 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A. | Visually unleveled patterns will be corrected in 3D within software to level the grid 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


B. | Software will filter in dots only 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Captured data will be segmented to a predefined amount of bits 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A. | Dots will be segmented into predefined spacing and values and identified 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Dots will go through decoding 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


A. | Decoded values will turn into keys 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Value of the segmented portion will go through a dot finder which is in the server library 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A. | Dot coordinates will be stored in a library with exact offsets prior to production 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Software analyzes offsets of each dot within segmented area 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A. | Offset values give each dot a unique position by calculating other dots beside it
