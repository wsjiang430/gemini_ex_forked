Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading designer and manufacturer of zero-emission commercial trucks and buses and charging infrastructure solutions for fleets, large enterprises, original equipment manufacturers, and governments. Our product offerings range from cargo vans, transit and shuttle buses, school buses, specialty work trucks, ambulances and electric powertrains for school buses, transit buses and motorcoaches. Our product solutions help our customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, lower operating costs and improve energy efficiency. 
During 2022, we produced 381 units consisting of zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs, and separately sold zero-emission powertrains, of which 11 units are for our internal use. During 2022, we sold 227 units compared to the sale of 146 units in 2021, an increase of 55%%. To date, all of the ZEVs we have sold are fully certified through executive orders issued by the California Air Resource Board, or CARB, the agency that certifies a vehicle as compliant with all emissions related requirements in California. We currently maintain ten executive orders for our ZEVs, and most recently received one for our 2022 ZEV4TM. As of February 28, 2023, we had over 450 vehicles on the road with over 3.7 million miles driven.
We started in 2008 as a manufacturer of hybrid systems for commercial vehicles. In 2017, we redirected our efforts to focus exclusively on the market opportunity in ZEVs. We successfully and quickly adapted to developing ZEVs by leveraging nearly 10 years of extensive knowledge and production infrastructure for the hybrid systems. Our 14-year track-record of research and development, significant customer engagement and validation, and focus on building highly customized vehicles has allowed us to create an electric solution that we believe remains ahead of the competition in terms of technology, reliability, and versatility. We combine internally-developed, optimized modular software, which can be used in multiple platforms and applications, with hardware designs that allows us to address a diverse range of opportunities in the markets in which we operate in a cost-effective manner. Our flexible approach provides a significant time-to-market advantage. We believe we are the only full-range manufacturer of Class 3 to 7 ZEVs in the United States providing end-to-end electrification solutions including advanced analytics software and mobile charging solutions to our customers.
Recent Developments
In 2022, we continued to expand our product offerings, business partnerships and technologies.
•We developed and produced our first GM 4500 platform ZEV4TM, that expands our chassis offerings, further demonstrating our ability to adapt our modular technology and transition away from single-supply components.
•We launched our second-generation mobile vehicle battery charger, our highly anticipated, first in class, mobile DC fast charger, to be available for purchase or lease, that provides a fast-charging solution while permanent charging infrastructure is being constructed, and that also enables fleets to charge vehicles in the field.

Additionally, Lightning Insights provides complete control over Lightning’s fleet charging solutions including charger access, charge time scheduling, load management, payment methods and more.
•We launched our second generation repower program for 40-foot transit buses, available to municipal and private transit agencies throughout North America. 
•We launched our first online fleet planner and fleet configuration tool allowing interested customers to receive an operating cost analysis, carbon reduction information and vehicle recommendations based on their need.
•We expanded our cooperation with Collins Bus Corporation, a leading manufacturer of Type A school buses.
•We expanded our manufacturing to a total of 130,000 square feet, invested in automation and new processes and significantly increased our production capacity.
Products and Technologies
Our complementary suite of products, software and services are designed to deliver highly reliable and cost-effective solutions to our customers operating vehicles in a wide range of commercial applications. Our goal is to simplify the electrification process for our customers and provide solutions that flow from the vehicle purchase to the charging infrastructure to the after-sale analytics and service support. Lightning’s “fleet electrification equation solution” for fleet 
managers covering vehicles, charging infrastructure, software, service, financing and public incentives or funding, offers a customized solution package to address customer needs, uses, and funding and financing options.
Through our free fleet configuration tool, Fleet Planner, fleet managers are able to input their individual fleet characteristics and receive a customized operating cost analysis and carbon reduction metrics based on the recommended ZEV that best fits their specific needs.
Zero-emission Vehicles and Powertrains
Our technology is optimized for ZEVs in Classes 3 to 7, covering gross vehicle weights of approximately 10,000 to 33,000 pounds, running in urban environments, ranging from medium-duty vans to motorcoaches. Typically, the level of customization is higher for ZEVs compared to traditional combustion engine commercial vehicles. Because our software and hardware are modular, we are able to select from our code and hardware libraries to create configurations that suit customers’ needs across a broad category of use applications. Our modular customization strategy allows us to adapt relatively quickly to fulfill orders with multiple configurations.
In addition to building complete ZEVs, we also design and sell electric powertrains to our OEM partners. We train third-party and OEM technicians to install and service the powertrains within the OEMs’ manufacturing facilities.
We offer a wide range of vehicles, including passenger vehicles, cargo vehicles, ambulances, and city transit bus and motorcoach repowers. Our ZEVs are ideal for localized applications such as airport parking, hospitals, universities, and commercial campuses, as well as middle- and last-mile deliveries. All our ZEVs support both Level 2 AC charging and DC fast charge. We offer a standard 5-year or 60,000-mile warranty with our ZEVs, with extended warranty options available. For warranty services, we have a team of direct service technicians who travel to customer sites to perform repairs and updates, as well as trained local service providers, on an as-needed basis.
Our principal platforms are: 
Lightning ZEV3™ Transit van: The Lightning ZEV3™ Transit van is equipped with a state-of-the-art electric drivetrain and, depending on the selected battery configuration, offers a 140-mile to 200-mile range. As a passenger or cargo van it can be used for micro-transit, private and public shuttle services or middle- and last-mile deliveries. In specialty applications it can be outfitted as a Type 2 ambulance. The ZEV3 Transit van is “Buy America” certified, and most recently passed, Altoona testing, qualifying the ZEV3 Transit for purchases under certain Federal Transit Administration’s, or FTA, $1.7 billion incentive programs.
Lightning ZEV4™: The Lightning ZEV4™ can be outfitted as a shuttle bus with a capacity of up to 18 passengers in many applications, such as airport parking, college and corporate campuses, and senior communities, or as a work truck, as a cargo van or box truck for middle- and last-mile deliveries, or as a Type 3 ambulance. It is equipped with our state-of-the-art electric powertrain on the widely-used GMC Savana 4500 / Chevrolet Express 4500 platforms. It achieves a range of up to 130 miles and is also available with cargo lifts, refrigeration systems and other upfit options. The Lightning ZEV4™ can also be outfitted as a type A school bus, such as the model built in partnership with Collins Bus Corporation. We expect the ZEV4 to be eligible for federal incentive programs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, that provides up to $40,000 in tax credits, as well as various state programs, such as the California HVIP program which provides vouchers for up to $60,000. 
In addition, we offer repowered powertrains for class 7 and 8 transit buses and motorcoaches that replace their diesel or CNG engines with our battery-electric drivetrain as an alternative to purchasing a new, more expensive, all-electric vehicle. For example, we are the exclusive motorcoach repower electrification solution provider to ABC Companies, a leading motorcoach distributor in the United States. Our electric repower solution offers a shorter delivery time and a pricing advantage compared to many new electric buses and coaches manufactured by other OEMs.
We are currently developing and testing additional platforms, such as class 5 and 6 trucks and buses, and expect to start production in 2024.
Lightning Energy
We sell, both mobile and stationary, chargers and energy systems as supporting products to our ZEV customers. There are significant complexities associated with designing, installing and supporting charging infrastructure. We believe that by providing charging infrastructure with the vehicle, we can ensure compatibility and provide the customer with a single point of contact if an issue were to arise. We believe that providing a packaged turnkey vehicle with charging solutions accelerates sales and scale-up cycles and is a competitive advantage.
Our second-generation mobile battery vehicle charger that we manufacture in-house provides flexible charging solutions while permanent infrastructure is being built and also provides a commercial vehicle rescue solution. It offers DC fast charge for up to five electric vehicles with a capacity of 105kWh to up to 420 kWh, making it the ideal charging solution for charging trucks, vans, buses and cars at remote locations, special events and depots.
Lightning Insights™
Our proprietary Lightning Insights telematics and analytics platform, which is installed in each ZEV and powertrain sold, allows us to collect up to 160 data points for every ZEV and optimize drive cycle and vehicle performance data in real-time. Our manned network operations center monitors and analyzes all the vehicle telematics data for service and support issues, and allows us to provide predictive maintenance and support to our customers. This data is also integrated with our charging software. By integrating a complete charging solution with vehicle telematics, fleet managers are able to coordinate their fleet assets to maximize uptime and minimize cost, schedule vehicle charging times to improve energy usage and save money, utilize vehicle-to-grid technology to earn energy credits, use the vehicle and charger data to further EV deployments, intelligently pair vehicles and chargers to meet daily route needs, and much more. This data provides drivers and fleet operators meaningful real-time recommendations about how to improve vehicle performance, routes, and charging strategies and scale their electric vehicle fleets. Lightning Insights also provides fully compliant reporting for all federal, state, and local EV and charger incentive programs such as the California HVIP, the FTA’s Low or No Emission Vehicle Program, or LowNo, the EPA Clean School Bus Program, and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS. Our analytics platform is offered on a subscription basis with all ZEV and powertrain purchases. We are currently developing a mobile application featuring custom driver notifications.
Customers
We sell primarily to commercial vehicle fleet operators, making our sales process Business-to-Business focused and our products bespoke to our customers’ needs. We also partner with Collins Bus and its dealer network to sell electric school buses to government entities, such as transit agencies and school districts. Because we work directly with our customers, we are able to assess and meet their needs in a cost-effective manner. We believe our customers choose to partner with us because we are a one-stop shop for ZEVs and charging and energy infrastructure, across Classes 3 to 7 in the United States. We aim to take the complexity out of the EV purchasing process by helping customers specify the vehicles that suit their individual needs based on our in-depth telematics/analytics while also providing them with charging solutions for their fleets. Our vehicles currently on the road with customers, some for as long as 42 months, benefit from extensive validation with customers and end-users, and are deployed in real working conditions, gathering real-time data. Our customers represent some of the largest global fleet operators and logistics providers in the world, as well as a variety of other large enterprises and governments across a variety of commercial vehicle categories. 
We have also developed partnerships with specialty vehicle OEMs, who are critical to our growth strategy and enable us to apply our modular technology to an expanding range of markets including recreational vehicles, ambulances, school buses, coaches, etc. We work closely with manufacturing partners including Forest River, Rev Group, Winnebago and ABC Companies to electrify vehicles in their target markets that they manufacture. For example, we are the exclusive motorcoach repower electrification solution provider to ABC Companies, a leading motorcoach distributor in the United States. Our four largest customers accounted for approximately 19%, 16%, 12% and 11% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 40% and 25% of our total accounts receivables.
Many of our customer purchase orders have long lead times and contain contingencies, such as completing a successful pilot program, obtaining third-party financing, or obtaining government grants such as HVIP. The conversion of our order backlog to revenue is dependent, among other things, on our ability to obtain and secure a steady supply of components used in our manufacturing process, and in some cases particular customizations require longer lead times. For these 
reasons, we believe, that our order backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of potential sales or future revenue, and we will no longer include an actual dollar amount of backlog in our disclosure.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing facility is located in Loveland, Colorado. At this facility, we design, manufacture, assemble and test our ZEVs, powertrains and charging solutions. We currently operate a single 8-hour shift with capacity to manufacture and assemble 1,500 ZEVs and/or powertrain units per year. Our manufacturing space comprises over 130,000 square feet. We continue to invest in our facility and systems. For example, we use multiple LightGuide projected augmented reality software systems, automated welding collaborative robots, an automatic fastener torque system, and recently deployed a fully digital manufacturing execution system providing visual floor management and electronic work order system. In addition, we are installing two state-of-the-art chassis dynamometers that will allow us to accelerate testing of our ZEVs on-site and continue to improve our quality and optimize efficiency. 
Supply Chain Partners
Since 2008, we have built an ecosystem of supply-chain partners and specialty vehicle partners. Our suppliers are instrumental to the performance and reliability of our vehicles and enable us to scale in a relatively cost-effective manner. Our key suppliers include General Motors, Inc., Dana Holding Corp., Danfoss, BorgWarner, Inc., ABB, Siemens AG, Proterra and CATL, among others, all of which are industry leading manufacturers of critical components like chassis, bodies, batteries and chargers. While we have experienced supply challenges with battery and chassis manufacturers in the past, primarily related to delivery commitments, quality, and performance, we continue to expand and improve our supply chain partnerships.
As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, two suppliers accounted for 20% and 15% of our total accounts payable and two suppliers accounted for 34% and 23% of inventory purchases. We aim to optimize our supply chain for quality, reliability, and cost. We believe our long-term relationships with supply chain partners will be a key driver in our ability to scale without unduly sacrificing quality or delivery times and serve as a foundation for our growth. We are building relationships with multiple suppliers for each core component of our vehicles. 
Sales and Marketing
Currently, we have a sales force consisting of sales representatives and regional sales managers located across the major markets in the United States. Our education-focused, technically sophisticated sales force markets and sells a complete range of end-to-end electrification solutions directly to urban commercial fleets, which include commercial ZEVs, powertrains and charging services. We also engage with certain commercial vehicle dealers to market and sell our ZEVs. To further broaden awareness of our products and technologies, we regularly display our products at trade shows, such as the NTEA Work Truck show, the Advanced Clean Transportation show, the American Public Transportation Association show and the School Transportation News show, and host Lightning days where we demonstrate our vehicles, inform about our products, and allow hands-on ride and drive opportunities. 
Seasonality
Overall, the demand for our products is relatively consistent over the year, based on our limited history. However, in typical market conditions, the North American automobile market experiences a higher level of production in the first half of the year due to fewer holidays and the practice of plant shutdowns in July and December and model year changeovers. We have also experienced delays in customer orders in the fourth quarter and early in the year due to grant funding cycles. Typically, government programs establish a budget for the coming year late in November or December with roll-outs starting in the first quarter of the following year. The market has experienced seasonality because school districts order school buses in late Spring or early Summer to be available for the coming school year.
Industry Background and Market
According to McKinsey & Co., or McKinsey, worldwide sales of light commercial electric vehicles were less than 200,000 units in 2021, and represented 2% of sales in that segment. Further, per McKinsey, 75% of the 200 largest fleet operators in the United States comprising approximately 1.2 million vehicles, have committed to reduce carbon emissions in their fleets 
and many have started to invest in ZEVs. See Getting to carbon-free commercial fleets, December 13, 2022, Saral Chauhan, Malte Hans, Moritz Rittstieg, Saleem Zafar.
Based on a study by the World Resources Institute, there are nearly half a million school buses in the United States with more than 90% of those on the road today being diesel powered. Demand for electric school buses is growing, evidenced by 2.5% of the school bus fleet already committed to converting to electric school buses. Recent federal and state policy commitments and incentives, such as $5 billion in EPA funding, IRA grants, and state funding which is often stackable, are expected to accelerate demand for electric school buses. See Electric School Bus U.S. Market Study and Buyer's Guide, August 18, 2022, Alissa Huntington, Jessica Wang, Phillip Burgoyne-Allen, Emmett Werthmann, Eleanor Jackson, World Resources Institute.
Based on estimates by the National Automobile Association, approximately 245,000 medium-duty commercial trucks, passenger vans and buses are expected to be sold in 2023 in the U.S. See Truck Beat, December 2022, Patrick Manzi, NADA. We believe, a portion of those sales will be for electric vehicles, of which many will qualify for government funding, such as the IRA, FTA programs, various state programs, such as HVIP, and the EPA Clean School Bus initiative.
We believe that some of the major drivers for the adoption of ZEVs are the lower operating costs and total cost of ownership versus combustion engine vehicles, the availability of grant and incentive programs, improving charging infrastructure and government mandates requiring low- or zero-emissions vehicles. Some of the challenges in the commercial fleet markets continue to be the availability of financing, the price of ZEVs compared to combustion engine vehicles, and support infrastructure.
Customers of our ZEVs generally see lower operating costs versus a comparable combustion engine vehicle as a result of lower fuel costs, lower maintenance expenses, fewer fluids, such as engine oil, that require regular changing, reduced brake wear due to regenerative braking and fewer moving parts overall as compared to combustion engine vehicles.
We do not incorporate third-party studies or articles into this annual report on Form 10-K.
Competition 
We believe that our primary competition today is with legacy OEM internal combustion engine-based vehicles. As the regulatory environment is changing over the next several years, we expect to face more competition from manufacturers of electric commercial vehicles. There are both traditional specialty vehicle OEMs and an increasing number of newer companies that have announced offerings of commercial electric trucks, vans or buses. We currently have few competitors in the medium-duty electric vocational van and shuttle bus space, including GreenPower Motor Company, XOS Trucks, Sea Electric, Workhorse and Motiv. We compete with Micro Bird Corporation in the market for Type A school buses. We believe the competitive factors in our markets are talent and culture, technological innovation, product performance and quality, product availability, customization options, service options, customer experience, brand differentiation, product design and style, pricing, manufacturing scale and efficiency. We believe that we have a head start and compete efficiently with our competitors (including the large OEMs) on the basis of these factors; however, the competitive landscape is dynamic and our competitors may develop greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research and development, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the electric vehicle market may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
Research and Development 
Our primary areas of focus for research and development include, but are not limited to (i) ZEV development and system integration for additional vocational applications and weight classes, development of our built-for-purpose electric vehicle platforms, developed on our Lightning e-chassis, and optimizing cost and efficiencies in our current platforms; (ii) software and algorithms for our electrification solutions; (iii) telematics and data analytics with over-the-air update support; (iv) accelerated lifetime testing processes to improve reliability, maintainability and system-level robustness; (v) sub-systems enhancement; and (vi) mobile and wireless charging solutions. We expect to remain focused on R&D for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in R&D activities to expand our commercial reach into additional markets.
Intellectual Property
We protect our growing intellectual property portfolio through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers. We seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. Unpatented research, development, know-how, and engineering skills make a vital contribution to our business, and we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property. While we currently are in the process of applying for patent protection for some of our inventions, trade-secrets, particularly with respect to our software and supply chain, are our primary form of intellectual property protection. We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications as we consider appropriate under the circumstances relating to the new technologies that we develop. 
Government Regulations and Incentives
In the automotive space in which we operate, we are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing matters including environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. A brief summary of material government and environmental regulations and incentives is set forth below. 
Motor Vehicle Safety
Our vehicles are subject to compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or FMVSS, and other regulatory obligations established by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, or NHTSA. Lightning is a registered USDOT Intermediate Stage Manufacturer, Final Stage Manufacturer, Incomplete Vehicle Manufacturer, and Vehicle Alterer. Any chassis or body modifications performed by us must be designed, manufactured, tested, and self-certified to ensure that the final ZEV complies with applicable FMVSS requirements. 
We are also required to comply with or demonstrate exemptions from other requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFÉ, standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements. Where required, our ZEV are fully compliant with the foregoing referenced standards. We also have systems in place to ensure compliance with all reporting obligations to NHTSA.
The battery packs we use in our ZEVs must conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. Governing regulations, issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the United Nations Recommendations and Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, as well as related UN Manual of Tests and Criteria.
EPA and CARB Emissions Compliance and Certification 
Under the U.S. Clean Air Act, medium and heavy-duty vehicles and powertrains are required to obtain a certificate of conformity issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and a California executive order issued by CARB. This regulatory process is designed to ensure that all vehicles comply with applicable emission standards for both criteria pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides or NOx, and particulate matter, and greenhouse gases, or GHG, such as CO2 and nitrous oxide. A certificate of conformity is required for vehicles sold in all states, and a CARB executive order is required for vehicles sold in California, and in 17 states and the District of Columbia, that have adopted the California standards that are either already effective or take effect in the next few years. CARB sets more stringent standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California and must obtain a waiver of preemption from the EPA before implementing and enforcing such standards. California’s waiver of preemption with regard to GHG emission standards is currently the subject of legal challenges, and the authority of California to implement and enforce GHG emission standards for vehicles and engines in the future is uncertain. The EPA certificate of conformity and CARB executive order must be obtained for each model year for each class of vehicle. Failure to obtain or comply with the terms of a certificate of conformity or executive order is subject to civil penalty and administrative or judicial enforcement. We currently utilize EPA certified chassis from major OEM’s (an alternative fuel vehicle certification from the EPA is not required for our ZEVs), and maintain ten active CARB executive orders. 
Pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA adopted Phase 1 fuel efficiency and GHG standards for medium-duty vehicles and engines on September 15, 2011. The EPA adopted more stringent fuel efficiency and GHG standards for medium-duty vehicles and engines on October 25, 2016. Manufacturers of vehicles and engines may comply with the GHG standards by selling increasing percentages of ZEVs. CARB also has adopted GHG and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. The Advanced Clean Trucks, or ACT, Regulation approved by CARB in June 2020 requires medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to produce and offer for sale in California increasing numbers of ZEVs. These regulatory standards increase annually beginning in 2024, and will require that 30%-50% of new truck sales in California (depending on class) be ZEVs by 2030, and 55%-75% (depending on class) by 2035. 
Offset credits for early production of heavy-duty ZEVs became available in model year 2021. We are registered, and bank these credits which can then be sold to truck OEMs that are not in compliance with the ACT regulation for a period of 5 years.
Additional CARB regulations mandating ZEV deployment in specific vocations are in various stages of development or implementation. These include the Zero Emission Fleet Rule, Innovative Clean Transit Regulation, and the Zero Emission Airport Shuttle Regulation. 
Receipt of an EPA certificate of conformity and CARB executive order obligates the holder to ensure that the covered engine or vehicle is capable of complying with applicable standards throughout the full useful life of the product, which for medium-duty vehicles may be ten years or from 120,000 to 185,000 miles, whichever comes first and depending on the engine and vehicle size. Emissions control system warranty coverage must be provided for a period of five years or 50,000 to 100,000 miles (CARB warranty obligations increasing to up to 110,000, 150,000 and 350,000 miles in 2022), whichever comes first and depending on the engine and vehicle size. During this time, manufacturers must repair emission-related defects at no cost to the customer. Throughout the full useful life of the engine or vehicle, manufacturers are required to remedy in-use problems that cause engines or vehicles to exceed emission standards for criteria pollutants or GHGs.
Manufacturers may have to conduct recalls, service campaigns or other field actions, or provide extended warranties to address any such in-use issues that may arise. The EPA is considering extending the warranty period, including by adopting the CARB warranty obligations of 110,000, 150,000, or 350,000 miles, depending on the engine size. Manufacturers of medium-duty engines and vehicles also must ensure that their products comply with on board diagnostics, or OBD, requirements. The OBD system is intended to identify and diagnose malfunctions within the engine, after treatment and emission control systems and alert the driver to the underlying issue so the vehicle can be brought in for service. CARB issues approval of the OBD system as part of its issuance of an executive order; the EPA deems demonstration of compliance with CARB's OBD requirements to satisfy the EPA’s requirements. As with emissions compliance, manufacturers are required to ensure that the OBD system functions as designed and can identify component malfunctions throughout the full useful life of the vehicle or engine.
Incentive and Grant Programs
Many customers of electric vehicles utilize state and federal incentive programs to offset the higher initial costs of electric vehicles, as well as to fund the installation of charging equipment. Our customers have historically leveraged the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project, or HVIP, as well as Volkswagen Emissions Mitigation Trust Fund funding that is allocated to each state to purchase our vehicles and charging systems. Most recently, the EPA Clean School Bus program, the Low-and No-Emission Vehicle program, and the Federal Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, as well as several state programs will provide material new incentives for electric vehicles in 2023 and beyond.
Inflation Reduction Act. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. The IRA extends the existing tax credit for electric vehicles and establishes a new tax credit for used EVs, and establishes a new tax credit for commercial EVs. Under the IRA, commercial EVs will be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to the lesser of 30% of the sales price or the incremental cost of a comparable ICE-engine vehicle, capped at $7,500 for vehicles under 14,000 pounds and $40,000 for all others. In addition, governmental entities may also be eligible to claim these credits in the form of cash payments. Commercial vehicles are exempt from the battery or mineral sourcing requirements that apply to consumer electric vehicles. The federal tax credit on charging equipment has been extended through 2032. For commercial uses, the tax credit is 6% with a maximum credit of $100,000 per unit. The equipment must be placed in a low-income community or non-urban area. The IRS is still in the process of releasing further guidance on specific aspects of the IRA credits.
HVIP. The California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project, or HVIP, provides point-of-sale vouchers for certain qualifying ZEVs. Under HVIP, dealers and fleet operators may request vouchers from HVIP on a first-come first-served basis, up to the funding amount available for that year, to reduce the cost of purchasing hybrid and zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses. Voucher amounts vary depending on a range of factors, such as the type of vehicle, the location where the vehicle is operated and the number of vehicles sold. To qualify for HVIP, dealers are required to complete extensive training, initiate and complete applications for each sales order, and complete the voucher redemption process upon delivery to the end-user. Vehicle manufacturers must apply to have their ZEV and buses included in HVIP’s voucher program. Once a make and model is included in the program, the manufacturer is not required to submit a full application for the succeeding year’s program unless the vehicle has been modified. On November 17, 2022, CARB allocated approximately $2.2 billion in HVIP funding for various initiatives in 2023 through 2024, including for zero-emission trucks, transit and school buses, small fleet conversions and demonstration and pilot projects. HVIP represents the most utilized of the subsidy programs due to its ease of access and amount of funding per vehicle. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived approximately 10% of our revenue from HVIP funding. 
Clean School Bus Program. The EPA launched its Clean School Bus Program in 2022 which makes available approximately $1.2 billion in 2022 and an aggregate of $5 billion until 2026 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. 
Low- and No-Emission Vehicle Program. The Federal Transit Administration set aside approximately $1.7 billion in 2022 for bus and bus facilities funding to state and local governmental authorities for the purchase or lease of zero-emission and low-emission transit buses as well as acquisition, construction, and leasing of required supporting facilities.
State Incentives. A number of states and municipalities in the United States, as well as certain private enterprises, offer incentive programs to encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, including tax exemptions, tax credits, exemptions, and special privileges. Other states have also implemented various incentives for the purchase of eligible ZEVs based on weight class and propulsion type. For example, New York and New Jersey implemented voucher incentive programs similar to HVIP. New Jersey and Washington exempt the purchase of ZEVs from state sales tax. California, Colorado, Oregon, and Oklahoma provide substantial state tax credits or rebates for the purchase of ZEVs. Some of these programs have eligibility limits based on either consumer income or the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of the vehicle. Others will supply rebates only until a set aside amount of funding exists. Several states will also be phasing out incentives over time or volume of ZEVs are sold. Other incentives include preferential parking at reduced rates, or free, or single occupancy high-occupancy vehicle access on highways for ZEVs.
Charging Infrastructure: Several states and utilities commissions offer funding to cover the cost of setting up both public and private chargers and related infrastructure, most notable of these are the California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Emission Credit Programs 
Certain vehicle emissions performance standards as well as our installation of stationary chargers may provide an opportunity for us to sell emissions credits. The registration and sale of ZEVs in California may earn us ZEV credits that we can sell to other OEMs. Other states within the United States that have adopted similar programs include Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.
Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits, LCFS. California and certain other states adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standards using LCFS credit mechanisms in connection with deployment of ZEV infrastructure. LCFS credits for charging infrastructure are specifically tied to the owner/operator of the electric vehicle supply equipment, providing a significant incentive for us to expand rentals of charging equipment. There is no regulatory limit to the number of credits which can be accumulated and banked. Credit deficits under the LCFS have frequently exceeded credit generation since 2017, and there continues to be significant (and growing) requirements for producers of fossil fuels to offset the carbon intensity of their fuels. LCFS credit demand is expected to continue to grow as regulatory carbon intensity benchmark requirements already in place mandated increases from 7.5% reduction in 2020 to 20% reduction by 2030. 
GHG Credits. The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule requires all manufacturers of medium-duty engines and vehicles to comply with fleet average GHG standards. Manufacturers may comply with the standards by producing engines or vehicles, all of which comply with the standards, or by averaging, banking and trading GHG credits within vehicle or engine categories. Manufacturers may also comply with GHG standards by purchasing credits from manufacturers with a surplus of credits. The failure to comply with GHG standards can lead to civil penalties or the voiding of a manufacturer’s EPA Certificate of 
Conformity. In connection with the delivery and placement into service of zero-emission and low-emission vehicles, we may earn tradable GHG credits that can be sold to other manufacturers. Under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule, plug-in hybrid, all-electric and fuel cell vehicles earn a credit multiplier of 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5, respectively, for use in the calculation of GHG emission credits. 
Commercial engine and vehicle manufacturers are required to meet the NOx emission standard for each type of engine or vehicle produced. Typical diesel engine emission control technology limits the fuel economy and GHG improvements that can be made while maintaining compliance with the NOx standard. As the fleet average GHG standards continue to decrease over time, compliance with the NOx standard may increase the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the applicable GHG standards. Accordingly, manufacturers of diesel trucks may need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule provides the opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who require such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation currently does not limit the number of GHG credits sold within the same commercial vehicle categories. 
California also has a GHG emissions regulatory program that is similar to the EPA requirements. Like the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule, the CARB rule allows for averaging, banking and trading of credits to comply with the fleet-average GHG standard and the failure to comply with the California GHG standard may lead to the imposition of civil penalties. The delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles in California may earn us tradable credits that can be sold. Under CARB GHG regulations, advanced technology vehicles also earn a credit multiplier of for use in the calculation of emission credits in the same amounts as under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule. 
Human Resources
Our employees are critical to our success. As of February 28, 2023, we had 269 employees, of which 268 are full-time. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. 
Our corporate citizenship, social responsibility and commitment to our employees extends beyond the products we make. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to a culture which values equality and respect. As part of our total rewards philosophy, we believe in offering and maintaining competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees in order to attract and retain a talented, highly engaged workforce. Our compensation programs are focused on equitable, fair pay practices including market-based compensation, an annual pay-for-performance incentive plan, and employee equity in the form of restricted stock unit grants. In addition to our competitive compensation practices, we offer a competitive benefits package that includes health care plan options with employee premiums lower than the market average, dental, vision, disability and life insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, company matched 401(k), flexible work schedules, expanded mental health coverage and employee assistance programs. 
We are committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees. We provide regular health and safety training both on-site as needed and through our virtual training tool that assigns training requirements based on job profiles and site-specific requirements. Our environmental, health and safety group is responsible for health and safety related to on-site operations including hazard and risk identification. Workplace safety is also reinforced in regularly occurring meetings of our operations team. We are committed to the standards of the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct which promotes labor, health and safety, environmental and business ethics. We monitor our Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Incident Rate, or TRIR, as a measure to assess the effectiveness of our workplace safety programs. TRIR is a measure of accidents and injuries relative to hours worked. TRIR is defined as the number of incidents per 100 full-time employees that have resulted in a recordable injury or illness in the pertinent period. During 2022, we had a TRIR of 1.99, compared to an industry-standard of 3.5 in the same period. We had no work-related fatalities in 2022. 
We believe in supporting the environment, health and social services across the communities in which we operate and where our employees live. We have partnered with a community college to provide equipment and funding to train technicians and develop skilled labor that may lead to employment opportunities with us or other local companies. We offer each employee eight hours of paid-time off to volunteer with a 501(c)(3) organization of the employee’s choosing. We are also involved with various civic and humanitarian organizations including the Rotary Club and Habitat for Humanity.
