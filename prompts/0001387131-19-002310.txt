      Our Business-Hospital/Healthcare Facilities
     Our mission is to be the leading provider of products and on-demand application services for the healthcare industry, specializing in bedside video monitoring, software tools to improve hospital communications and operations, and patient education and entertainment packages. Our proprietary, high-speed data network system is the next generation of patient care monitoring that allows real-time bedside and point-of-care video monitoring designed to improve patient safety and overall hospital costs. The entertainment packages and patient education enhance the patient’s quality of stay. Reported results from CareView-driven facilities prove that our products reduce falls, reduce the cost of sitter fees, increase patient satisfaction and reduce bed turnaround time to increase patient flow. For patients, we have a convenient in-room, entertainment package that includes high-speed Internet, access to first-run on-demand movies and visual connectivity to family and friends from anywhere in the world. For the hospital, we offer tools to provide superior patient care, peace of mind and customer service satisfaction.
     Our CareView System® suite of video monitoring, guest services and related applications connect patients, families and healthcare providers. Through the use of telecommunications technology and the Internet, our evolving products and on-demand services greatly increase the access to quality medical care and education for patients/consumers and healthcare professionals. We understand the importance of providing high quality patient care in a safe environment and believe in partnering with hospitals to improve the quality of patient care and safety by providing a system that monitors continuously. We are committed to providing an affordable video monitoring tool to improve the practice of nursing, create a better work environment and make the patient’s hospital stay more informative and satisfying. Our suite of products and services can simplify and streamline the task of preventing and managing patients’ falls, enhance patient safety, improve quality of care and reduce costs associated with bringing information technology directly to patients, families and healthcare providers. Our products and services can be used in all types of hospitals, nursing homes, adult living centers and selected outpatient care facilities domestically and internationally.

     CareView’s secure video monitoring system connects the patient room to a touch-screen monitor at the nursing station or a mobile handheld device, allowing the nursing staff to maintain a level of visual contact with each patient. This configuration enhances the use of the nurse call system, reduces unnecessary steps to and from patient rooms, and facilitates a host of modules for patient safety and workflow improvements. The CareView System suite can be easily configured to meet the individual privacy and security requirements of any hospital or nursing facility. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA’) compliant, patient approved video record can be included as part of the patient’s medical record and serves as additional documentation of bedside care, procedures performed, patient and hospital ancillary activities, safety or care incidents, support to necessitate additional clinical services, and, if necessary, as evidence. Additional HIPAA-compliance features allow privacy options to be enabled at any time by the patient, nurse or physician.
     In addition to patient safety and security, we also provide a suite of services to increase patient satisfaction scores and enhance the overall image of the hospital including first-run on-demand movies, Internet access via the patient’s television, and video visits with family and friends from most places throughout the world. Through continued investment in patient care technology, our products and services help hospitals and assisted living facilities build a safe, high quality healthcare delivery system that best serves the patient, while striving for the highest level of satisfaction and comfort.
     Our Products and Services
     We offer a variety of products and services designed to meet individual hospital needs to enhance quality patient care and safety. Our services are offered with no capital expenditure by the hospital and do not require extensive integration with the facility’s management information system. For healthcare facilities looking for an effective, affordable and innovative way to improve performance throughout the facility, our products are the answer. CareView-driven facilities have shown documented success in reducing patient falls and sitter costs, improving overall patient satisfaction, streamlining and documenting patient education at the bedside, and improving patient flow and overcrowding. These successes protect the facilities’ reimbursement from loss due to never events and poor patient satisfaction.
     The CareView System offers the following service packages:

      Pricing Structure and Revenue Streams
     The CareView System suite is provided and installed in healthcare facilities at no charge to the facility after which we generate revenue from subscriptions to its services. We work with each hospital on pricing to offer an affordable package based on the demographics of the hospital’s patients. The pricing structure with each hospital is negotiated separately and may vary depending on the hospital’s desire to include premium services at no charge to the patient. Typically, we offer the Primary Package at a price per bed with varying price structures based on number of beds in each facility. All of our revenue generated during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was derived from the sale of the Primary Package, Additional CareView Products and related services to hospitals.

---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Update to Products and Services Agreement with Healthcare Facilities
     We offer our products and services through a subscription-based model with healthcare facilities through a Products and Services Agreement (the “P&S Agreement(s)”). During the term of the P&S Agreement, we provide continuous monitoring of the CareView System’s products and services deployed to a healthcare facility and maintain and service all equipment installed by us. Terms of each P&S Agreement require the healthcare facility to pay us a monthly subscription fee based on the number of selected, installed and activated services. None of the services provided through the Primary Package or GuestView module are paid or reimbursed by any third-party provider including insurance companies, Medicare or Medicaid. We also enter into corporate-wide agreements with healthcare companies (the “Master Agreement(s)”), wherein the healthcare facilities that are a part of these healthcare companies enter into individual facility level agreements that are substantially similar to our P&S Agreements.
     Master Agreements and P&S Agreements are currently negotiated for a period of five years with a minimum of two or three years; however, older P&S Agreements were negotiated for a five-year period with a provision for automatic renewal. P&S Agreements specific to pilot programs (“P&S Pilot Agreements”) contain pricing terms substantially similar to P&S Agreements, are generally three or six-months in length and can be extended on a month-to-month basis as required. We own all rights, title, and interest in and to the equipment we install at each location and agree to maintain and repair it; although, we may charge for repairs or replacements due to damage or misuse. We are not responsible for maintaining data arising from use of the CareView System or for transmission errors, corruption or compromise of data carried over local or interchange telecommunication carriers. We grant each healthcare facility a limited, revocable, non-transferable and non-exclusive license to use the software, network facilities, content and documentation on and in the CareView System suite to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to access, explore and otherwise use the CareView System suite in real time. Such non-exclusive license expires upon termination of the P&S Agreement.
       6
 
     We use specific terminology in an effort to better define and track the staging and billing of the individual components of the CareView System suite. The CareView System suite includes three components which are separately billed; the Room Control Platform (the “RCP”), the Nurse Station, and mobile devices (each component referred to as a “unit”). The term “bed” refers to each healthcare facility bed as part of the overall potential volume that a healthcare facility represents. For example, if a healthcare facility has 200 beds, the aggregate of those beds is the overall potential volume of that healthcare facility. The term “bed” is often used interchangeably with “RCP” or “Room Control Platform” as this component of the CareView System consistently resides within each room where the “bed” is located. On average, there are six Nurse Stations for each 100 beds. The term “deployed” means that the units have been delivered to the healthcare facility but have not yet been installed at their respective locations within the facility. The term “installed” means that the units have been mounted and are operational. The term “billable” refers to the aggregate of all units on which we charge fees. Units become billable once they are installed and the required personnel have been trained in their use. Units are only deployed upon the execution of a P&S Agreement or P&S Pilot Agreement.
     Update on Significant Customer Agreements
     HealthTrust
     On December 14, 2016, the Company entered into a Group Purchasing Agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P.

The agreement was effective on January 1, 2017 and all CareView System components and modules are available for purchase by HealthTrust’s exclusive membership. HealthTrust members may order CareView’s products and services included in the agreement directly from CareView.
     On October 1, 2018, the Company added CareView Connect to the HealthTrust GPO Agreement.

     In February 2014, we entered into a Master Agreement with Tenet Healthsystem Medical, Inc. (“Tenet”). The terms of the Master Agreement provide for the execution of a facilities level agreement with each hospital. We are currently billing 418 units monthly.     Kaiser Permanente
     We currently are billing 508 units monthly in seven Kaiser Permanente (“Kaiser”) facilities. In April and May 2014, we executed P&S Pilot Agreements with Kaiser’s Baldwin Park and Panorama City facilities, respectively. This is in addition to our P&S Pilot Agreement with Kaiser Orange County covering its facilities in Anaheim and Irvine, California which was executed in October 2013. The P&S Pilot Agreements for these four facilities provide for a monthly renewal until termination or replacement by a Master Agreement or individual P&S Agreements. We finalized a P&S Agreement with the Irvine facility in October 2016 and we are now in the process of finalizing a conversion from a P&S Pilot Agreement to a P&S Agreement with the Anaheim facility. Both of these facilities are in the process of determining their needs as it relates to adding additional units.
     On November 2, 2015, we signed a P&S Agreement with Kaiser’s San Diego Medical Center. We currently have 28 installed units at this facility and anticipate adding additional beds once use and need has been determined.
     In early 2016 we commenced discussions with Kaiser Northwest Region for deployment of the CareView System in Kaiser’s hospitals in Oregon. On November 10, 2016, we signed a P&S Pilot Agreement with the Northwest Division of Kaiser Permanente. Execution of this agreement signals our expanded growth within the Kaiser system. The agreement calls for the installation of 81 units at the Westside Medical Center.
     After a successful pilot, in February 2016 we executed a P&S Agreement with Kaiser’s Los Angeles Medical Center for a total of 136 units. We are also in pilot discussions with other Kaiser facilities in the San Diego area. While we are continuing our sales efforts at the hospital and regional level, there are still discussions regarding a possible Master Agreement. Notwithstanding those discussions we will continue to sell into other Kaiser Regions and look to convert our P&S Pilot Agreements into P&S Agreements that can be replaced by a Master Agreement if and when one is finalized.

CareView is in discussions with two additional BHSF facilities.     Adventist Health
     In March 2017 we entered into a P&S Agreement with White Memorial Hospital for 78 units (“White Memorial”) following a successful pilot. White Memorial is part of the Adventist Health. There are a total of 16 facilities in the Adventist Health network. We are working on collecting data in anticipation of setting up a meeting to discuss a Master Agreement and system-wide roll-out. To that end, we began billing on a P&S Agreement with Glendale Adventist for 68 units on January 1, 2018 and on November 14, 2017 we began billing Adventist Health Bakersfield for 58 units.     Baylor Scott & White Health
     On June 30, 2017 we executed a Master Agreement with Baylor Scott & White Health (“BSW”) corporate. We have had meetings with the following BSW facilities as we move toward a corporate roll-out, which include: BSW Temple, BSW All-Saints, BSW Hillcrest, BSW Round Rock, BSW Waxahachie, and BSW White Rock. These facilities are gathering data so we can generate proposals. CareView is being used in three facilities where we are billing for a total of 309 units.     VA Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System
     The Company accomplished its first contract with a VA facility, specifically the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (“CAVHS”). Central Arkansas Memorial Veterans Hospital added 40 beds to the CareView contract in June 2018. The CareView System is now completely installed at John L. McClellan Memorial Veterans Hospital in Little Rock with 146 units installed and billable.
     The Eugene J. Towbin Healthcare Center awarded CareView a contract for 85 beds in June 2018. This is the first Community Living Center, a VA Nursing Home, to use CareView, and could lead to adoption by other VA Community Living Centers.
     These agreements are pursuant to the Company’s General Service Administration (“GSA”) Multiple Award Schedule contract (“MAS”). The MAS allows us to sell the CareView System at a negotiated rate to the approximate 169 VA facilities with over 39,000 licensed beds and the approximate 42 DOD hospitals with over 2,600 licensed beds. The MAS is one of the most widely accepted government contract vehicles available to agency procurement officers. GSA’s application process requires potential vendors to be recognized as highly credible and well established. We are hopeful that once installation and training is complete, the other VA hospitals will also want to participate. Our products and services represent an enormous opportunity to improve the health and safety of our Nation’s veterans.            9

     Our Business-CareView Connect
     Our mission is to be the leading provider of resident monitoring products and services for the long-term care industry. We took what we learned in our medical facility business and applied it to developing a product to serve the long-term care market. With CareView ConnectTM Quality of Life System (“CareView Connect”), CareView has again positioned itself as a technology leader with its innovative suite of products specifically designed for all aspects of the long-term care market, including: Nursing Care, Home Care, Assisted Living and Independent Living.
     With this mission in mind, in the second quarter of 2018, the Company introduced a new sensor product that will have application in both the assisted living center market and the home health market. CareView Connect leverages both passive and active sensors to track the activities of daily life. CareView Connect provides peace of mind by using data from the resident’s activity, existing conditions, and environment to notify a caregiver of potential emergencies and identify the need for dignified support. CareView Connect consists of a small emergency assist button, two motion sensors, one sleep sensor, and one event sensor. Resident activity levels, medication administration, sleep patterns, and requests for assistance can all be monitored depending on which options are selected.
       11
 
     The skilled nursing home market consists of approximately 2,000,000 beds, which is double the size of the current hospital/healthcare facility bed market. The assisted living center market is even larger at approximately 3,000,000 beds. Our products flow naturally into the nursing home space as it is substantially the same setting as hospital rooms. To service this intended expansion, we have hired sales staff to pursue new business in these markets and we anticipate that we will sign new contracts in these markets before the end of 2019.
     Our Products and Services
     CareView Connect is a platform consisting of several products and applications targeted at improving level of care and efficiency. CareView is building a cohesive and tightly integrated solution that solves several problems that long-term care facilities face. We offer an array of wearable and stationary buttons that allow a resident to summon help either for an emergency or assistance, which can be anything from toileting help to assistance putting on their shoes. We offer a mobile app capable of delivering an alert to the caregiver and allows them document information around that alert. This allows for workflows and reports around the alerts, i.e. how long before the alert was handled, what was the cause of the alert, and if not acknowledged in a timely manner then escalate the alert to another individual or group. This ensures that every alert is responded to timely and is verifiable. In addition, the caregiver usually is carrying out a litany of daily activities directed at each facility resident.     Alert Management and Monitoring System
     CareView Connect provides a suite of hardware and software that facilitate a data-driven solution for alert management and monitoring. CareView Connect’s solution provides additional context, including location of the resident, which improves response time by the staff. The alert system includes a documentation platform that allows the facility’s staff to classify reason for alerts and provides metrics around response time. CareView Connect’s solution involves several passive sensors that monitor the resident.     Caregiver Platform
     The caregiver platform includes a “Leave of Absence” component, which allows the facility to document when the resident is outside of their room for a duration of time. This information is incorporated with known data from the workflows and sensors to improve awareness. The Caregiver Connect mobile application provides a convenient and intuitive interface to the CareView Connect platform. The caregiver can use the mobile app to capture important information and interface with critical workflows, such as acknowledging and documenting alert presses by the resident. CareView Connect also provides a product focused on capturing and measuring the mental state and pain experienced by the resident. “How are you feeling today?” provides a convenient way to capture information about the mental state of the resident using emojis. Similarly, “What is your pain today?” allows the staff to categorize and document pain. Connect Resident is a tablet application intended for the resident’s direct use. This product currently supports video conferencing with a remote caregiver, becoming a communications conduit for tele-health. Connect Resident also supports “How are you feeling today?”, which allows the resident to submit this information directly.     Quality of Life Metrics
     CareView is developing its own algorithm for measuring quality of life based on “best of breed” research and leveraging the data collected by the platform. CareView Connect’s Quality of Life Metrics focuses on several categories, including Physical Activity, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Interaction, Mental Health, and Sleep Quality. Leveraging this data, the facility and their staff have improved visibility into the health and well-being of their residents. By applying machine learning and predictive analytics, subtle patterns and trends that may not otherwise be visible become actionable. The facility can use this information to present a more compassionate and capable level of care, differentiating the facility from their competition. The Quality of Life Metrics information can be made available to the family and loved ones, opening a new channel of remote awareness and care. Because the information is collected automatically, the family gains awareness on issues of which their loved ones may normally be unaware. The Connect Family mobile application allows family members to monitor their loved one and receive alerts and notifications based on their preferences.

     CareView is working to integrate additional sensors into the platform, including a ballistocardiogram (BCG) sensor, which allows for improved monitoring and metrics around sleep quality, such as heart and respiration rate. Additional sensors include medical devices, such as scales, pulse oximeters, blood glucose meters, and blood pressure monitors.
     Pricing Structure and Revenue Streams
     The CareView Connect suite of products and services offers multiple pricing models. We work with each facility on pricing to offer an affordable package based on the demographics of the residents of the facility. The pricing structure with each facility is negotiated separately. Typically, we offer the CareView Connect basic package at a price per monitored room with varying price structures based on number of sensors and number of residents in each facility.     Products in Development
    
1. | Additional Sensors. We are finalizing efforts around two new sensors, door sensor and improved stationary button. These sensors round out our existing family of sensors and improve accuracy of passive data collected about the resident. We expect both sensors to be available in the second quarter of 2019.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Next Generation Gateway. We are in the final steps of research and development for the next generation Gateway. This platform will provide integrated audio capabilities with an optional touch screen. We expect the Next Generation Gateway to be in production in the fourth quarter of 2019.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Improved Quality of Life Report. We are in the early steps of research and development on an improved Quality of Life Report. This report builds on top of best of breed research and incorporates additional data sources. We expect the improved Quality of Life report to available in the third quarter of 2019.

     Summary of Product and Service Usage
     The following table shows the number of healthcare facilities using our products and services including the number of deployed units, installed units and billable units as of January 31, 2019. The table also shows the number of pilot programs in place and hospital proposals pending approval, estimated bed count if the pilot programs and pending proposals result in executed contracts, and the estimated total number of licensed beds available under the pilot programs and hospital proposals. There are no assurances that the pilot programs will be extended or the pending proposals will be approved to ultimately result in the number of estimated beds. Further, there are no assurances that we will have access to the total number of licensed beds in each healthcare facility.
Installed Hospitals | Installed Units | Billable Units | Total Staffed Beds in Contracted/ Pilot Hospitals | Potential Units Available Under Current Contract/ Pilot Contracts(*) | Units in Negotiation Prior to Contract/ Pilot 
----------------------+-------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------
128 | 10,446 | 7,828 | 160,116 | 59,158 | 54,285 

 
 
 (*) This number represents management’s best estimate of the number of units available to us in hospitals that are currently under contract. We assume that in any given acute care facility, our products and services are appropriate for deployment in approximately 70% of the total staffed beds. If we have specific information from a current contracted or pilot hospital that the number of potential units in that hospital is either higher or lower than 70%, specific number has been used in the aggregate estimate.
     Availability of Suppliers
     We are not dependent on, nor do we expect to become dependent on, any one or a limited number of suppliers. We purchase parts and components to assemble our equipment and products. We do not manufacture or fabricate our own products or systems but rely on sub-suppliers and third-party vendors to procure and/or fabricate components based on our designs, engineering and specifications. Along with our employee installers, we enter into subcontracts for field installation of our products which we supervise. We manage all technical, physical and commercial aspects of the performance of our contracts with sub-suppliers and third-party vendors. To date, we have experienced no difficulties in obtaining fabricated components, materials and parts or in identifying qualified subcontractors for installation work.     Sales, Marketing and Customer Service
     We do not consider our business to be seasonal, however the availability of hospital staff is typically less available in December which impacts our ability to sell/install our CareView System. We generate sales leads through a variety of means including direct one-to-one marketing, email and web campaigns, customer and industry referrals, strategic partnerships, and trade shows and events. Our sales team consists of highly trained professionals with many years of experience in the healthcare market.
       14
 
     Our initial focus has been to pursue large for-profit hospital management companies that own multiple facilities and large not-for-profit integrated delivery networks in major metropolitan areas. Our sales staff approaches decision makers for hospitals, integrated delivery networks, and major owners and operators of hospitals to demonstrate the CareView product line. In 2013, we expanded our sales process to include an inside sales team and have expanded our capabilities of providing web-based demonstrations and presentations. In addition, we have begun to rely more heavily on arranging reference calls and site visits between our current customers and our prospects. These efforts have provided a higher volume of qualified sales leads and have resulted in more substantive conversations with a larger number of prospects.
     We ensure high levels of customer service through our account representatives and through our technical support processes. We attempt to position our account representatives geographically close to our customer hospitals to allow them to make regular visits to proactively train staff and address any issues. We offer 24/7 monitoring and phone support through our technical support team which allows us to quickly identify and resolve any technical issues. From time to time we are called upon to service the installed hardware at customer facilities. To facilitate expedient service, our account representatives typically maintain a small supply of RCPs should they need repair or replacement. Historically, our RCPs and Nursing Station units have required little, if any, servicing. We believe that we handle requests quickly and efficiently, and that overall, our customers are satisfied with our level of service.
     Intellectual Property
     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property portfolio is one of the means by which we attempt to protect our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect our products and to maintain our competitive position. We are constantly seeking ways to protect our intellectual property through registrations in relevant jurisdictions.
     We have received patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and have numerous patents pending. We intend to file additional patent applications when appropriate; however, we may not file any such applications or, if filed, the patents may not be issued. We also have numerous registered trademarks.
     We intend to aggressively prosecute, enforce and defend our patents, trademarks and proprietary technology. The loss, by expiration or otherwise, of any one patents may have a material effect on our business. Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that the patents issued to or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties.
     Joint Venture with Rockwell Holdings
     On November 16, 2009, we entered into a Master Investment Agreement (the “Rockwell Agreement”) with Rockwell Holdings I, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability (“Rockwell”). Under the terms of the Rockwell Agreement, we used funds from Rockwell to fully implement the CareView System™ in Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma (“Hillcrest”) and Saline Memorial Hospital in Benton, Arkansas (“Saline”) (the “Project Hospital(s)”). CareView-Hillcrest, LLC and CareView-Saline, LLC were created as the operating entities for the Project Hospitals under the Rockwell Agreement (the “Project LLC(s)”).
       15
 
     On January 31, 2017, under the terms of the Rockwell Agreement, wherein we have the option to purchase Rockwell’s interest in the Project LLCs, we exercised that right by entering into a Settlement and LLC Interest Purchase Agreement with Rockwell (the “Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we paid Rockwell the aggregate amount of $1,213,786 by the issuance of a promissory note to Rockwell for $1,113,786 (the “Rockwell Note”) and a cash payment of $100,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Rockwell Note, we will make quarterly principal payments of $100,000, with each payment being made on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning with the first payment date of March 31, 2017 and continuing on the last business day of each subsequent calendar quarter through September 30, 2019. We were not in default of any conditions under the Settlement Agreement as of December 31, 2018. The final payment due on December 31, 2019 was to be a balloon payment of $13,786 representing the remaining principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest. Effective February 2, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the modification agreement with PDL and PDL Modification Agreement, we entered into an amendment to the Rockwell Note wherein the quarterly payments under the Rockwell Note were reduced to $50,000 per quarter during the term of the PDL Modification Agreement, with the final payment due on December 31, 2019 a balloon payment of $263,786 representing the remaining principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest.
     As additional consideration to Rockwell for entering into the Rockwell Agreement, we granted Rockwell Warrants to purchase 1,151,206 shares of our Common Stock on the date of the Rockwell Agreement, and, using the Black-Scholes Model, valued the Warrants at $1,124,728 (the “Project Warrant”), which amount was fully amortized at December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the expiration date of the Project Warrant was extended from November 16, 2017 to November 16, 2022. All other provisions of the Project Warrant remained unchanged. At the time of the extension, the Project Warrant were revalued resulting in a $11,512 increase in fair value, which has been recorded as non-cash costs included in general and administration expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Effective February 2, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the PDL Modification Agreement, we entered into an amendment to the Project Warrant wherein the Project Warrant’s exercise price was changed from $0.52 to $0.05, resulting in a $13,814 increase in fair value, and this transaction was recorded as non-cash costs included in general and administration expense in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.
     Installation and Technical Support
     Along with our employee installers and technical support staff, we provide installation and technical support for our customers through third-party providers located across the United States that we contract on a per-job basis.     Competition
     We offer products in four distinct categories: clinical video monitoring and fall prevention, patient education and entertainment, patient flow, and mobile communications. We have competitors in each of these product areas; however, we believe that we offer the only integrated suite of products that combines all of these areas into one cost-effective platform. Some of our competitors may be larger, may have greater financial resources, and may have a longer history than us. We compete with them based on price, engineering and technological expertise, knowledge, and the quality of our products, systems and services. Additionally, we believe that the successful performance of our installed products and systems is a key factor in retaining current business and gaining new business as customers typically prefer to make significant purchases from a company with a solid performance history.
     Clinical Video Monitoring and Fall Prevention: Cisco Systems, Inc., Avasure (a division of AvaSure Holdings, Inc.), Royal Philips Electronics and Cerner Corporation all provide clinical video monitoring tools. Cisco offers Virtual Patient Observation, a video monitoring tool aimed at reducing sitter costs and preventing patient falls. AvaSure offers a similar application using cameras mounted on a rolling camera stand, aimed at preventing patient falls. Philips offers the eICU product, which primarily targets a high-definition monitoring of patients in intensive-care applications and also provides telephonic consults. Cerner offers the Cerner Patient Observer product, which uses depth sensors aimed at preventing patient falls.            16
 
     Alternative fall prevention mechanisms include physical sensors manufactured by Stanley and Posey, and beds which include fall alarms manufactured by Stryker and Hill-Rom. Customers may consider these physical fall prevention mechanisms to be alternatives to a video-based fall prevention system such as the one we offer.
     Patient Education and Entertainment: There are many vendors who offer patient entertainment products, and most of them also provide a portal for accessing patient educational content either authored by themselves or by third parties. Our major competitors include The GetWellNetwork (privately held by Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe), Skylight Healthcare Systems, and Sonifi Solutions, Inc., all of which offer interactive patient communications systems.
     Patient Flow: These systems may be called patient flow, census, bed tracking, patient tracking, or “bed board” applications. Our major competitors include companies that offer focused solutions such as TeleTracking Technologies, Inc., Aionex, Inc., and BedWatch, Inc. Additionally, some Electronic Medical Record vendors offer similar products which may compete with our patient flow product.
     Mobile Communications: Some competitors offer mobile communications on smart phones or voice-activated pendants which operate over the hospitals Wi-Fi system, including Vocera, Inc., and Voalte, Inc. Other competitors offer special-purpose phones that operate on the cellular network or other wireless technology and provide notifications to caregivers within the hospital.
     In addition to favorable economics and enhanced patient care, safety and satisfaction, we also compete on the basis of quality of services provided. Our management believes that our GuestView patient services suite will provide revenue protection for our contracted hospitals under the Value Based Purchasing initiative which is part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, prompting hospitals to focus on Patient Satisfaction and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems to (i) prompt each healthcare facility to promote patients’ use of NetView, and PatientView, and (ii) encourage the hospital to expand its use of pre-procedure and condition videos, welcome videos, and other ancillary services.
     We believe we also compete based on the success of our products and services which provide our customers with:
    
● | significant and tangible cost savings,
--+---------------------------------------


● | reductions in patient falls and pressure ulcers,
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | improved documentation, quality and timeliness of patient care,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | enhanced safety and security for patients and facilities,
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | support for new technologies,
--+------------------------------


● | business growth,
--+-----------------


● | return on investment, and
--+--------------------------


● | enhanced patient satisfaction.
--+-------------------------------

      We are currently unable to predict what competitive impact any regulatory development and advances in technology will have on our future business and results of operations. We believe our success depends upon our ability to maintain and enhance the performance, content and reliability of our products in response to the evolving demands of the industry and any competitive products that may emerge. We cannot give assurances that we will be able to do so successfully or that any enhancements or new products that we introduce will gain acceptance in the marketplace. If we are not successful or if our products are not accepted, we could lose potential customers to our competitors.

     Major Customers
     For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, 100 and 103 hospitals accounted for all of our revenue. During 2018, one customer comprised 25% of our revenue, while no other customer comprised more than 10%. During 2017, four customers comprised 57% of our revenue, while no other customer comprised more than 10%.     Backlog
     Our estimated backlog is driven by signed Master and P&S Agreements. Each Master and P&S Agreement establishes the rates that we will charge for the use of our products and services as well as an approximate number of billable units that will be installed. Our RCPs, Nursing Stations and mobile devices are billed on a per unit basis. Most Master and P&S Agreements are for five years but include options to cancel after a minimum of two or three years. Backlog, which covers the non-cancellable period, as of December 31, 2018 is approximately $8,300,000, of which approximately $4,500,000 is expected to be billed during 2019. Most of the current backlog will have future value as the Master and P&S Agreements continue beyond the minimum two or three years and the Master and P&S Agreements move toward expiration and potential renewal. The amount of the non-cancellable backlog to be billed beyond December 31, 2019 is approximately $3,800,000.     Governmental Approval
     Neither our Company nor our products are subject to government approval beyond required Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) certifications. Certain medical devices and applications may be subject to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, which regulates the ability of medical device manufacturers to market their devices. CareView has reviewed the requirements for registration, and at the current time, we do not believe that our suite of applications is subject to 510(k) regulation. Although the parameters of our CareView System products and services complies with HIPAA as far as use by health care providers, CareView itself, as the manufacturer and installer of the units, is not subject to HIPAA regulations. We do not know of any other privacy laws that affect our business as we are not in control of nor do we keep patient medical records in our possession. We are unaware of any probable government regulations that may affect our business in the future. We have received Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) and FCC approval on our products. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not pay or reimburse any party for use of our products and services.     Environmental Laws
     Our Company and our products are not affected by any federal, state, or local environmental laws; therefore, we have reserved no funds for compliance purposes.
     Employees
     As of March 6, 2019, we employed 51 persons on a full-time basis, two of whom are executive officers. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced a major work stoppage, strike or dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be outstanding.     Reports to Security Holders
     We are subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) under the Exchange Act which requires us to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and we are required to comply with all other obligations of the Exchange Act applicable to issuers filing registration statements pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.
