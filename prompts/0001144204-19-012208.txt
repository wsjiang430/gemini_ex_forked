Item 1. Business
General
 
NorthWest Indiana Bancorp, an Indiana corporation (the “Bancorp”), was incorporated on January 31, 1994, and is the holding company for Peoples Bank SB, an Indiana savings bank (the “Bank”). The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp. The Bancorp’s business activities include being a holding company for the Bank and the Bank's wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as a holding company for NWIN Risk Management, Inc., a captive insurance company.
 
The Bank is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and the origination of loans, mostly upon the security of single family residences and commercial real estate, as well as, construction loans and various types of consumer loans, commercial business loans and municipal loans, within its primary market areas of Lake and Porter Counties, in Northwest Indiana, and Cook County, Illinois. In addition, the Bancorp's Wealth Management Group provides estate and retirement planning, guardianships, land trusts, profit sharing and 401(k) retirement plans, IRA and Keogh accounts, investment agency accounts, and serves as the personal representative of estates and acts as trustee for revocable and irrevocable trusts.
 
The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), an agency of the federal government. As the holding company for the Bank, the Bancorp is subject to comprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), while the Bank is subject to comprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by both the FDIC and the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”). The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FRB governing reserves required to be maintained against certain deposits and other matters. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Indianapolis, which is one of the eleven regional banks comprising the system of Federal Home Loan Banks.
 
On July 26, 2018, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of First Personal Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (“First Personal”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 20, 2018 (the “First Personal Merger Agreement”), between the Bancorp and First Personal. Pursuant to the terms of the First Personal Merger Agreement, First Personal merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the “First Personal Merger”). Simultaneous with the First Personal Merger, First Personal Bank, an Illinois state chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of First Personal, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving institution. In connection with the First Personal Merger, each First Personal stockholder holding 100 or more shares of First Personal common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.1246 shares of Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $6.67 per share in cash for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of First Personal common stock received $12.12 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of First Personal common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that a First Personal stockholder would have otherwise received in the First Personal Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $42.95. The Bancorp issued a total of approximately 161,875 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former First Personal stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $8.7 million. Based upon the closing price of the Bancorp’s common stock on July 25, 2018, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $15.6 million. The acquisition represented the Bank’s first expansion into the South Suburban Chicagoland market, and expanded the Bank’s full-service retail banking network to 19 banking centers.
 
On January 24, 2019, the Bancorp completed its acquisition of AJS Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“AJSB”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 30, 2018 (the “AJSB Merger Agreement”), between the Bancorp and AJSB. Pursuant to the terms of the AJSB Merger Agreement, AJSB merged with and into the Bancorp, with the Bancorp as the surviving corporation (the “AJSB Merger”). Simultaneous with the AJSB Merger, A.J. Smith Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of AJSB, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving institution. In connection with the AJSB Merger, each AJSB stockholder holding 100 or more shares of AJSB common stock received fixed consideration of (i) 0.2030 shares of the Bancorp common stock, and (ii) $7.20 per share in cash for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Stockholders holding less than 100 shares of AJSB common stock received $16.00 in cash and no stock consideration for each outstanding share of AJSB common stock. Any fractional shares of Bancorp common stock that an AJSB stockholder would have otherwise received in the AJSB Merger were cashed out in the amount of such fraction multiplied by $43.01. The Bancorp issued 416,478 shares of Bancorp common stock to the former AJSB stockholders, and paid cash consideration of approximately $15.4 million. Based upon the closing price of the Bancorp’s common stock on January 23, 2019, the transaction had an implied valuation of approximately $34.2 million, which includes unallocated shares held by the AJSB Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), some of which were cancelled in connection with the closing to satisfy the ESOP’s outstanding loan balance. As a result of the acquisition, the Bank was able to further expand its retail banking network in the South Suburban Chicagoland market, bringing the total number of its full-service banking centers to 22.


The Bancorp maintains its corporate office at 9204 Columbia Avenue, Munster, Indiana, from which it oversees the operation of its twenty-two branch locations. For further information, see “Properties.”

Lending Activities
 
General. The Bancorp’s product offerings include residential mortgage loans, construction loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, commercial business loans and loans to municipalities. The Bancorp’s lending strategy stresses quality growth, product diversification, and competitive and profitable pricing. While lending efforts include both fixed and adjustable rate products, the focus has been on products with adjustable rates and/or shorter terms to maturity. It is management’s goal that all programs are marketed effectively to our primary market area.

The Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities are limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual maturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater. These loans are sold, on a case-by-case basis, in the secondary market as part of the Bancorp’s efforts to manage interest rate risk. All loan sales are made to Freddie Mac or to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. All loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market value.
 
Under Indiana Law, an Indiana stock savings bank generally may not make any loan to a borrower or its related entities if the total of all such loans by the savings bank exceeds 15% of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus (plus up to an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, in the case of loans fully collateralized by readily marketable collateral); provided, however, that certain specified types of loans are exempted from these limitations or subject to different limitations. The maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities at December 31, 2018, under the 15% of capital and surplus limitation was approximately $14,686,000. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had no loans that exceeded the regulatory limitations.
 
At December 31, 2018, there were no concentrations of loans in any type of industry that exceeded 10% of total loans that were not otherwise disclosed as a loan category.

Loan Maturity Schedule. The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2018 regarding the dollar amount of loans in the Bancorp’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of due-on-sale clauses, which give the Bancorp the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage. The amounts are stated in thousands (000’s).

Lending Area. The primary lending area of the Bancorp encompasses Lake County in northwest Indiana and Cook County in northeast Illinois, where collectively a majority of loan activity is concentrated. The Bancorp is also an active lender in Porter County, and to a lesser extent, LaPorte, Newton and Jasper counties in Indiana; and Lake and Will counties in Illinois.
Loan Origination Fees. All loan origination and commitment fees, as well as incremental direct loan origination costs, are deferred and amortized into income as yield adjustments over the contractual lives of the related loans.

------------

Loan Origination Procedure. The primary sources for loan originations are referrals from commercial customers, real estate brokers and builders, solicitations by the Bancorp’s lending and retail staff, and advertising of loan programs and rates. The Bancorp employs no staff appraisers. All appraisals are performed by fee appraisers that have been approved by the Board of Directors and who meet all federal guidelines and state licensing and certification requirements.
 
Designated officers have authorities, established by the Board of Directors, to approve loans. Loans up to $2,500,000 are approved by the loan officers’ loan committee. Loans from $2,500,000 to $4,000,000 are approved by the senior officers’ loan committee (SOLC). All loans in excess of $4,000,000, up to the legal lending limit of the Bank, must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors or its Executive Committee. (All members of the Bank’s Board of Directors and Executive Committee are also members of the Bancorp’s Board of Directors and Executive Committee, respectively.) Certain loan renewals and extensions may not require approval by the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee as long as there is no material change, credit downgrade, significant change in borrower or guarantor status, material release or change in collateral value or the eligible loan renewal or extension is not outside the current concentration limits set by the Board of Directors. The maximum in-house legal lending limit as set by the Board of Directors is the lower of 10% of the Bank’s risk based capital or $7,000,000. Requests that exceed this amount will be considered on a case-by-case basis, after taking into consideration the legal lending limit, by specific Board action. The Bank will not extend credit to any of its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders or to any related interest of that person, except in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act and in an amount that, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that person, exceeds $500,000 unless: (1) the extension of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the Bank, and (2) the interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting.
 
All loans secured by personal property must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan. All loans secured by real estate must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan or restore the property to its original state. First mortgage loans must be covered by a lender’s title insurance policy in the amount of the loan.
 
The Current Lending Programs
 
Residential Mortgage Loans. The primary lending activity of the Bancorp has been the granting of conventional mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase existing homes, refinance existing homes, or construct new homes. Conventional loans are made up to a maximum of 97% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less. For loans made in excess of 80% of value, private mortgage insurance is generally required in an amount sufficient to reduce the Bancorp’s exposure to 80% or less of the appraised value of the property. Loans insured by private mortgage insurance companies can be made for up to 97% of value. During 2018, 68% of mortgage loans closed were conventional loans with borrowers having 20% or more equity in the property. This type of loan does not require private mortgage insurance because of the borrower’s level of equity investment.
 
Fixed rate loans currently originated generally conform to Freddie Mac guidelines for loans purchased under the one-to-four family program. Loan interest rates are determined based on secondary market yield requirements and local market conditions. Fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual maturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater may be sold and/or classified as held for sale to control exposure to interest rate risk.
 
The 15 year mortgage loan program has gained wide acceptance in the Bancorp’s primary market area. As a result of the shortened maturity of these loans, this product has been priced below the comparable 20 and 30 year loan offerings. Mortgage applicants for 15 year loans tend to have a larger than normal down payment; this, coupled with the larger principal and interest payment amount, has caused the 15 year mortgage loan portfolio to consist, to a significant extent, of second time home buyers whose underwriting qualifications tend to be above average.

The Bancorp’s Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans (“ARMs”) include offerings that reprice annually or are “Mini-Fixed.” The “Mini-Fixed” mortgage reprices annually after a one, three, five, seven or ten year period. ARM originations totaled $16.2 million for 2018 and $11.1 million for 2017. During 2018, ARMs represented 17.7% of total mortgage loan originations. The ability of the Bancorp to successfully market ARM’s depends upon loan demand, prevailing interest rates, volatility of interest rates, public acceptance of such loans and terms offered by competitors.
 
Construction Loans. Construction loans on residential properties are made primarily to individuals and contractors who are under contract with individual purchasers. These loans are personally guaranteed by the borrower. The maximum loan-to-value ratio is 89% of either the current appraised value or the cost of construction, whichever is less. Residential construction loans are typically made for periods of six months to one year.
 
Loans are also made for the construction of commercial properties. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting standards. Generally if the loans are not owner occupied, these types of loans require proof of intent to lease and a confirmed end-loan takeout. In general, loans made do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial construction loans are typically made for periods not to exceed two years or date of occupancy, whichever is less.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans are typically made to a maximum of 80% of the appraised value. Such loans are generally made on an adjustable rate basis. These loans are typically made for terms of 15 to 20 years. Loans with an amortizing term exceeding 15 years normally have a balloon feature calling for a full repayment within seven to ten years from the date of the loan. The balloon feature affords the Bancorp the opportunity to restructure the loan if economic conditions so warrant. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by commercial rental units, apartments, condominium developments, small shopping centers, owner occupied commercial/industrial properties, hospitality units and other retail and commercial developments.
 
While commercial real estate lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and the effects of general economic conditions on real estate developers and managers, the Bancorp has endeavored to reduce this risk in several ways. In originating commercial real estate loans, the Bancorp considers the feasibility of the project, the financial strength of the borrowers and lessees, the managerial ability of the borrowers, the location of the project and the economic environment. Management evaluates the debt coverage ratio and analyzes the reliability of cash flows, as well as the quality of earnings. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting standards and are generally supported by personal guarantees, which represent a secondary source of repayment.
 
Loans for the construction of commercial properties are generally located within an area permitting physical inspection and regular review of business records. Projects financed outside of the Bancorp’s primary lending area generally involve borrowers and guarantors who are or were previous customers of the Bancorp or projects that are underwritten according to the Bank’s underwriting standards.
 
Consumer Loans. The Bancorp offers consumer loans to individuals for personal, household or family purposes. Consumer loans are either secured by adequate collateral, or unsecured. Unsecured loans are based on the strength of the applicant’s financial condition. All borrowers must meet current underwriting standards. The consumer loan program includes both fixed and variable rate products. On a limited basis, the Bancorp purchases indirect dealer paper from various well-established businesses in its immediate banking area.
Home Equity Line of Credit. The Bancorp offers a fixed and variable rate revolving line of credit secured by the equity in the borrower’s home. Both products offer an interest only option where the borrower pays interest only on the outstanding balance each month. Equity lines will typically require a second mortgage appraisal and a second mortgage lender’s title insurance policy. Loans are generally made up to a maximum of 89% of the appraised value of the property less any outstanding liens.
Home Improvement Loans and Equity Loans—Fixed Term. Home improvement and equity loans are made up to a maximum of 85% of the appraised value of the improved property, less any outstanding liens. These loans are offered on both a fixed and variable rate basis with a maximum term of 240 months. All home equity loans are made on a direct basis to borrowers.

Commercial Business Loans. Although the Bancorp’s priority in extending various types of commercial business loans changes from time to time, the basic considerations in determining the makeup of the commercial business loan portfolio are economic factors, regulatory requirements and money market conditions. The Bancorp seeks commercial loan relationships from the local business community and from its present customers. Conservative lending policies based upon sound credit analysis governs the extension of commercial credit. The following loans, although not inclusive, are considered preferable for the Bancorp’s commercial loan portfolio: loans collateralized by liquid assets; loans secured by general use machinery and equipment; secured short-term working capital loans to established businesses secured by business assets; short-term loans with established sources of repayment and secured by sufficient equity and real estate; and unsecured loans to customers whose character and capacity to repay are firmly established.
Government Loans. The Bancorp is permitted to purchase non-rated municipal securities, tax anticipation notes and warrants within the local market area.
 
Non-Performing Assets, Asset Classification and Provision for Loan Losses
 
Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are generally placed on a non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, serious doubt exists as to the collectability of a loan. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Consumer non-residential loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes over 120 days delinquent. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status is charged against interest income. Subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding principal balance, tax and insurance reserve or recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan.
 
The Bancorp’s mortgage loan collection procedures provide that, when a mortgage loan is 15 days or more delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Bancorp will recast the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his, her or its financial affairs. If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 120 days, the Bancorp will generally initiate foreclosure proceedings. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure or by voluntary transfer of property made to avoid foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of by the Bancorp. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. At foreclosure, any write-down of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized, whereas holding costs are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and a valuation allowance is established by a charge to operations if the carrying value of a property exceeds its estimated fair value less selling costs. Subsequent gains or losses on disposition, including expenses incurred in connection with the disposition, are charged to operations. Collection procedures for consumer loans provide that when a consumer loan becomes ten days delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a payment deferral. If a loan continues to be delinquent after 60 days and all collection efforts have been exhausted, the Bancorp will initiate legal proceedings. Collection procedures for commercial business loans provide that when a commercial loan becomes ten days delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower pursuant to the commercial loan collection policy. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a payment deferral or restructure the loan. Once it has been determined that collection efforts are unsuccessful, the Bancorp will initiate legal proceedings.

Federal regulations require savings banks to classify their own loans and to establish appropriate general and specific allowances, subject to regulatory review. These regulations are designed to encourage management to evaluate loans on a case-by-case basis and to discourage automatic classifications. Loans classified as substandard or doubtful must be evaluated by management to determine loan loss reserves. Loans classified as loss must either be written off or reserved for by a specific allowance. Amounts reported in the general loan loss reserve are included in the calculation of the Bancorp’s total risk-based capital requirement (to the extent that the amount does not exceed 1.25% of total risk-based assets), but are not included in Tier 1 leverage ratio calculations and Tier 1 risk-based capital requirements.
 
Substandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other conditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms. No loans were internally classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.

In addition to identifying and monitoring non-performing and other classified loans, management maintains a list of special mention loans. Special mention loans represent loans management is closely monitoring due to one or more factors that may cause the loan to become classified as substandard.
 
The Bancorp's special mention loans are summarized below:

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.
 
Purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. Purchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination are considered purchased credit impaired loans. Expected future cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable (“accretable yield”). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. In determining the acquisition date fair value of purchased credit impaired loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Bancorp aggregates these purchased loans into pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses.

At times, the Bancorp will modify the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reduce the interest rate on the loan to a rate materially less than market rates, or materially extend the maturity date of a loan as part of a troubled debt restructuring. The valuation basis for the Bancorp’s troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of expected future cash flows; unless consistent cash flows are not present, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.
 
The Bancorp's troubled debt restructured loans are summarized below:

The increase in the troubled debt restructured loans reflected in the table above for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was the result of a $1.1 million commercial relationship as well as eight residential or home equity loans totaling $301 thousand which were modified as part of a troubled debt restructure or renewed with cash flow difficulties. The $1.1 million relationship was classified as substandard and remains in accrual status.
 
The increase in the nonperforming, substandard, special mention, and impaired loans reflected in the tables above for the twelve months ending December 31, 2018, are the result of the completion of the acquisition of First Personal as well as two large commercial relationships, one commercial real estate customer and one First Federal residential customer which were not related to the acquisition. First Personal loans totaling $612 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in nonperforming loans. One $1.1 million commercial relationship, First Personal loans totaling $721 thousand, one $523 thousand First Federal residential loan and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in substandard loans. First Personal loans totaling $2.8 million and one $2.1 million commercial relationship contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in watch loans, which was offset by the payoff of one $2.3 million commercial real estate loan. First Personal purchased credit impaired loans totaling $2.3 million, one $1.1 million commercial relationship and one $464 thousand commercial real estate loan contributed to the December 31, 2018 increase in impaired loans.

Investment Activities
 
The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to provide for the liquidity needs of the Bancorp and to contribute to profitability by providing a stable flow of dependable earnings. Securities can be classified as either held-to-maturity (HTM) or available-for-sale (AFS) at the time of purchase. No securities are classified as trading or as held-to-maturity. AFS securities are those the Bancorp may decide to sell if needed for liquidity, asset-liability management or other reasons. During 2018, the Bancorp did not hold as investments any derivative instruments and was not involved in hedging activities as defined by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging. It has been the policy of the Bancorp to invest its excess cash in U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal securities. In addition, short-term funds are generally invested as interest bearing balances in financial institutions and federal funds. At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp’s investment portfolio totaled $241.8 million. In addition, the Bancorp had $763 thousand of federal funds sold, and $3.5 million in FHLB stock.
 
The table below shows the carrying values of the components of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, on the dates indicated. The amounts are stated in thousands (000’s).

The Bancorp currently holds three trust preferred securities and the securities’ quarterly interest payments have been placed in “payment in kind” status. Payment in kind status results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest payments, management placed these securities in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2018, the cost basis of the three trust preferred securities on non-accrual status totaled $3.5 million.
 
Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits are the major source of the Bancorp’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bancorp derives funds from maturing investment securities and certificates of deposit, dividend receipts from the investment portfolio, loan principal repayments, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLB) and other borrowings. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. The Bancorp uses repurchase agreements, as well as a line-of-credit and advances from the FHLB for borrowings. At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp had $11.6 million in repurchase agreements. Other borrowings totaled $43.0 million, all of which were FHLB advances.
Deposits. Retail and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within the Bancorp’s primary market area. The Bancorp offers a broad selection of deposit instruments including non-interest bearing demand accounts, interest bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, certificate accounts and retirement savings plans. Deposit accounts vary as to terms, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Certificate account offerings typically range in maturity from ten days to 42 months. The deregulation of federal controls on insured deposits has allowed the Bancorp to be more competitive in obtaining funds and to be flexible in meeting the threat of net deposit outflows. The Bancorp does not obtain funds through brokers.

Borrowings. Borrowed money is used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds and is generally accomplished through repurchase agreements, as well as, through a line of credit and advances from the FHLB. Repurchase agreements generally mature within one year and are generally secured by U.S. government securities or U.S. agency securities, under the Bancorp’s control. FHLB advances with maturities ranging from one year to five years are used to fund securities and loans of comparable duration, as well as to reduce the impact that movements in short-term interest rates have on the Bancorp’s overall cost of funds. Fixed rate advances are payable at maturity, with a prepayment penalty.

Analysis of Profitability and Key Operating Ratios
 
Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential.
 
The net earnings of the Bancorp depend primarily upon the “spread” (difference) between (a) the income it receives from its loan portfolio and other investments, and (b) its cost of money, consisting principally of the interest paid on deposit accounts and on other borrowings.
 
The following table presents the weighted average yields on loans and securities, the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rate spread for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Competition
 
The Bancorp’s primary market area for deposits, loans and financial services encompasses Lake and Porter Counties, in Northwest Indiana, and Cook County in northeast Illinois. All of the Bancorp’s banking centers and offices are located in its primary market area. Approximately ninety-two percent of the Bancorp’s business activities are within this area.
 
The Bancorp faces strong competition in its primary market area for the attraction and retention of deposits and in the origination of loans. The Bancorp’s most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings associations, and credit unions located in its primary market area. Particularly in times of high interest rates, the Bancorp has had significant competition from mutual funds and other firms offering financial services. The Bancorp’s competition for loans comes principally from savings associations, commercial banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders.
 
The Bancorp competes for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides borrowers and other third-party sources. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a wide variety of savings accounts, checking accounts, competitive interest rates, convenient banking center locations, drive-up facilities, automatic teller machines, tax deferred retirement programs, electronic banking, and other miscellaneous services.

The activities of the Bancorp and the Bank in the geographic market served involve competition with other banks as well as with other financial institutions and enterprises, many of which have substantially greater resources than those available to the Bancorp. In addition, non-bank financial services companies with which the Bancorp and Bank compete, while subject to regulation by the CFPB, are generally not subject to the same type of extensive regulation by the federal and state banking agencies applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank.
 
Personnel
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 203 full-time and 46 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes its employee relations are good. The Bancorp has seven executive officers and has no other employees. The Bancorp’s officers also are full-time employees of the Bank, and are compensated by the Bank.
Regulation and Supervision
 
Bank Holding Company Regulation. As a registered bank holding company for the Bank, the Bancorp is subject to the regulation and supervision of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). Bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with and are subject to periodic examination by the FRB.
 
Under the BHCA, without the prior approval of the FRB, the Bancorp may not acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, and may not merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. In addition, the Bancorp is generally prohibited by the BHCA from engaging in any nonbanking business unless such business is determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Under the BHCA, the FRB has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the FRB's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 
Under the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank(s). Pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank(s) during periods of financial stress or adversity. This support may be required by the FRB at times when the Bancorp may not have the resources to provide it or, for other reasons, would not be inclined to provide it. Additionally, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), a bank holding company is required to provide limited guarantee of the compliance by any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become "undercapitalized" (as defined in the statute) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency.
 
Savings Bank Regulation. As an Indiana stock savings bank, the Bank is subject to federal regulation and supervision by the FDIC and to state regulation and supervision by the DFI. The Bank's deposit accounts are insured by DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.
 
Both federal and Indiana law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Current federal law also requires savings banks, among other things, to make deposited funds available within specified time periods.
 
Under FDICIA, insured state chartered banks are prohibited from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks, unless: (i) the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund, and (ii) the bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.
 
Branches and Acquisitions. Branching by the Bank requires the approval of the Federal Reserve and the DFI. Under current law, Indiana chartered banks may establish branches throughout the state and in other states, subject to certain limitations. Congress authorized interstate branching, with certain limitations, beginning in 1997. Indiana law authorizes an Indiana bank to establish one or more branches in states other than Indiana through interstate merger transactions and to establish one or more interstate branches through de novo branching or the acquisition of a branch. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by a state bank chartered by that state. The consent of the state is no longer required.

Transactions with Affiliates. Under Indiana law, the Bank is subject to Sections 22(h), 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which restrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies, such as the Bancorp. The statute limits credit transactions between a bank and its executive officers and its affiliates, prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank's extension of credit to an affiliate.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions, including state chartered FRB member banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 
Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock, and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until the buffer requirement became fully effective on January 1, 2019.
 
The FRB has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements.
 

Page 22 of 91
-------------

 

Bank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements established by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries. However, under the FRB’s “Small Bank Holding Company” exemption from consolidated bank holding company capital requirements, bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Bancorp, are exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases.
 
Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The law requires that certain supervisory actions be taken against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization. The FRB has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation as to state member banks. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
 
Subject to a narrow exception, a receiver or conservator is required to be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specified time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FRB within 45 days of the date an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized.” Compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company up to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when it was deemed to be undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve compliance with applicable capital requirements. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The FRB could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.
 
The following table shows that, at December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Bancorp’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements. The dollar amounts are in millions.

In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as “Basel IV.” The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled approaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. The leadership of the FRB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and FDIC, who are tasked with implementing Basel IV, supported the revisions. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Bancorp. The impact of Basel IV on the Bancorp will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal banking regulators.
 
Banking regulators may change these capital requirements from time to time, depending on the economic outlook generally and the outlook for the banking industry. The Bancorp is unable to predict whether and when any such further capital requirements would be imposed and, if so, to what levels and on what schedule.
 
New Accounting Standards With Regulatory Effect. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the current “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. Under the CECL model, the Bancorp will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the day-one regulatory capital effects of the CECL model. The final rule also revises the agencies’ other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards. The final rule will take effect April 1, 2019. The new CECL standard will become effective for the Bancorp for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Bancorp’s management is currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on the Bancorp’s accounting. Additional detail around managements current efforts can be found in Note 1 to the financial statements, under ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.


Dividend Limitations. The Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The primary source of the Bancorp’s cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on the Bancorp’s Common Stock, is the payment of dividends to the Bancorp by the Bank. Under Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating expenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank’s Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the DFI for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, “retained net income” means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from DFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be subject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement.
 
The FDIC has the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. In addition, under FRB supervisory policy, a bank holding company generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common shares unless (i) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, assets, quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB expects bank holding companies to consult with it in advance of declaring dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns (i.e., such as when the dividend is not supported by earnings or involves a material increase in the dividend rate) and in advance of repurchasing shares of common or preferred stock.
 
Federal Deposit Insurance. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to a maximum amount, which is generally $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules. There is no unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts. Rather, deposits held in noninterest bearing transaction accounts are aggregated with interest bearing deposits the owner may hold in the same ownership category, and the combined insured up to at least $250,000. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC pursuant to its regulations establishing a risk-related deposit insurance assessment system, based on the institution’s capital levels and risk profile. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk-weighted categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels, and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution’s initial assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. There are also adjustments to a bank’s initial assessment rates based on levels of long-term unsecured debt, secured liabilities in excess of 25% of domestic deposits and, for certain institutions, brokered deposit levels. Pursuant to FDIC rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act (described below), initial assessments ranged from 5 to 35 basis points of the institution’s total assets minus its tangible equity. The Bank paid deposit insurance assessments of $387 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2018. For 2018, the deposit insurance assessment rate before applying one-time credits was approximately 0.051% of insured deposits. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.

The Bank is also subject to assessment for the Financing Corporation (FICO) to service the interest on the FICO’s bond obligations. The amount assessed on individual institutions, including the Bank, by FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the risk-related assessment rate schedule. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2019. During 2018, the FICO assessment rate was 0.14 basis points for each $100 of insured deposits. The Bank paid interest payment assessments of approximately $23 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2018. Future increases in deposit insurance premiums or changes in risk classification would increase the Bank’s deposit related costs.
 
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund at no less than 1.35%, and must achieve the 1.35% designated reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. The FDIC must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions of less than $10 billion, and may declare dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least 1.5%, although the FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted dividend declarations. The FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at 2% of estimated insured deposits, which the FDIC has established as a long-term goal. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.36 percent, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Tangible equity for this purpose means Tier 1 capital. The rate schedules set forth in the rule governing the assessment base are scaled to the increase in the assessment base, including schedules that go into effect as the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, 2%, and 2.5%.
 
The schedules reduce the initial base assessment rate in each of the four risk-based pricing categories.
 

· | For small Risk category I banks, the rates range from 5-9 basis points.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The rates for small institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV are 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | For large institutions and large, highly complex institutions, the rate schedule ranges from 5 to 35 basis points. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are also adjustments made to the initial assessment rates based on long-term unsecured debt, depository institution debt, and brokered deposits. The FDIC also provides for an assessment system for large depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets.
 
The FDIC has the authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is one of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of trustees of the Federal Home Loan Bank. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis in an amount equal to the greater of 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the beginning of each year or 5% of our outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp owned $3.5 million of stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (“FHLBI”) and had outstanding borrowings of $43.0 million from the FHLBI. The FHLBI stock entitles the Bancorp to dividends from the FHLBI. The Bancorp recognized dividend income of approximately $151 thousand in 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp’s excess borrowing capacity based on collateral from the FHLBI was $118.6 million. Generally, the loan terms from the FHLBI are better than the terms the Bancorp can receive from other sources making it cheaper to borrow money from the FHLBI.
 
Federal Reserve System. Under regulations of the FRB, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts) and non-personal money market deposit accounts. The effect of these reserve requirements is to increase the Bank’s cost of funds. The Bank is in compliance with its reserve requirements.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank’s CRA performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, the Bank was rated “satisfactory” with respect to its CRA compliance.
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("Gramm-Leach"), bank holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the FRB as a "financial holding company" by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is well capitalized, well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the CRA. The Bancorp has no current intention to elect to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach.
 
Gramm-Leach established a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking agencies regulate the banking activities of financial holding companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulates their securities activities and state insurance regulators regulate their insurance activities.
 
Under Gramm-Leach, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
 
The Bancorp does not disclose any nonpublic information about any current or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law and subject to contractual confidentiality provisions which restrict the release and use of such information.
 
Cybersecurity Guidelines. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms. These enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which would not currently include the Bancorp. However, similar standards and/or regulations may be adopted or implemented by federal and state banking agencies in the future which may be applicable to community banking organizations such as the Bancorp.
 
Recent cyberattacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the federal banking regulators to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity. Among other things, financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address the risks posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to authenticate customers accessing internet-based services. A financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for monitoring the security of third-party service providers that may have access to nonpublic data at the institution. During 2018, the Bancorp did not discover any material cybersecurity incidents.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the Federal Reserve, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach and certain other statutes. Many of the consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies are now performed by the CFPB. The CFPB has a large budget and staff, and has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against, and examine, financial institutions. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by the federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practice in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. Additionally, this bureau is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities.
 
Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the CFPB has published several final regulations impacting the mortgage industry, including rules related to ability-to-pay, mortgage servicing, and mortgage loan originator compensation. The ability-to-repay rule makes lenders liable if they fail to assess ability to repay under a prescribed test, but also creates a safe harbor for so-called “qualified mortgages.” Failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule may result in possible CFPB enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual, class action, and attorneys’ fees damages, all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Federal preemption of state consumer protection law requirements, traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter, also was modified by the Dodd-Frank Act and requires a case-by-case determination of preemption by the OCC and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank. Depending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard, the operations of the Bank could become subject to additional compliance burdens in the states in which it operates.
 
Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, includes a series of amendments to the Truth In Lending Act with respect to mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and pre-payments. With respect to mortgage loan originator compensation, except in limited circumstances, an originator is prohibited from receiving compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan (other than the principal amount). The amendments to the Truth In Lending Act also prohibit a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless it determines, based on verified and documented information of the consumer’s financial resources, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The amendments also prohibit certain pre-payment penalties and require creditors offering a consumer a mortgage loan with a pre-payment penalty to offer the consumer the option of a mortgage loan without such a penalty. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act expands the definition of a “high-cost mortgage” under the Truth In Lending Act, and imposes new requirements on high-cost mortgages and new disclosure, reporting and notice requirements for residential mortgage loans, as well as new requirements with respect to escrows and appraisal practices.
 
Interchange Fees for Debit Cards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, interchange fees for debit card transactions must be reasonable and proportional to the issuer’s incremental cost incurred with respect to the transaction plus certain fraud related costs. Although institutions with total assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from this requirement, competitive pressures have required smaller depository institutions to reduce fees with respect to these debit card transactions.
Federal Securities Law. The shares of Common Stock of the Bancorp have been registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act (the “1934 Act”). The Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules of the SEC there under. If the Bancorp has fewer than 1,200 record shareholders, it may deregister its shares under the 1934 Act and cease to be subject to the foregoing requirements.

Page 27 of 91
-------------

 

Shares of Common Stock held by persons who are affiliates of the Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If the Bancorp meets the current public information requirements under Rule 144, each affiliate of the Bancorp who complies with the other conditions of Rule 144 (including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of certain other persons) would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of (i) 1% of the outstanding shares of the Bancorp or (ii) the average weekly volume of trading in such shares during the preceding four calendar weeks.
 
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bancorp is required to provide its shareholders an opportunity to vote on the executive compensation payable to its named executive officers and on golden parachute payments in connection with mergers and acquisitions. These votes are non-binding and advisory. At least once every six years, the Bancorp must also permit shareholders to determine on an advisory basis whether such votes should be held every one, two, or three years.
 
Federal Reserve Monetary Policies. The Bancorp’s earnings and growth, as well as the earnings and growth of the banking industry in general, are affected by the monetary and credit policies of monetary authorities, including the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits, and changes in the Federal Reserve discount rate. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant impact on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to have effects in the future.
 
In view of continually changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets, as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the FRB, it is difficult to predict the impact of possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, and loan demand, or their effect on the Bancorp’s business and earnings or on the financial condition of the Bancorp’s various customers.


Other Future Legislation and Change in Regulations. Various other legislation, including proposals to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies, is from time to time introduced. This legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Bancorp and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Bancorp cannot accurately predict whether any of this potential legislation will ultimately be enacted, and, if enacted, the ultimate effect that it, or implementing regulations, would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Bancorp or the Bank.
Federal Taxation
 
For federal income tax purposes, the Bank reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting. The Bancorp and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return for each fiscal year ending December 31.
State Taxation
 
The Bank is subject to Indiana’s Financial Institutions Tax (“FIT”), which is imposed at a flat rate of 7.0% on “adjusted gross income”. This rate is scheduled to decrease over the succeeding years as follows: to 6.25% for 2019, to 6.0% for 2020, to 5.5% for 2021, to 5.0% for 2022, and to 4.9% for 2023 and thereafter. Additionally, the Bank is subject to Illinois state tax which is imposed at a flat rate of 9.5%. “Adjusted gross income,” for purposes of FIT, begins with taxable income as defined by Section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and, thus, incorporates federal tax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several Indiana and Illinois modifications. Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes.
Accounting for Income Taxes
 
At December 31, 2018, the Bancorp has consolidated total deferred tax assets of $5.2 million and consolidated total deferred tax liabilities of $1.3 million, resulting in a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $3.9 million, net of an $87 thousand valuation allowance. The valuation allowance of $87 thousand was provided for the state tax credit, as management does not believe these amounts will be fully utilized before statutory expiration.
 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”), which includes a number of provisions that impact the Bancorp, including the following:
 

· | Corporate Tax Rate. The TCJA replaced the graduated corporate tax rates applicable under prior law, which imposed a maximum tax rate of 35%, with a reduced 21% flat tax rate. Although the reduced tax rate generally should be favorable to the Bancorp by resulting in increased earnings and capital, it decreased the value of our then-existing deferred tax assets effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the tax rate is a nonrecurring event that generally is not expected to have a substantial adverse impact on the Bancorp’s core earnings or capital over the long term.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Employee Performance-Based Compensation. A “publicly held corporation” is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to certain employees. The TCJA eliminated certain exceptions to the $1 million limit applicable under prior law related to performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals. As a result, the Bancorp’s ability to deduct certain compensation paid to our most highly compensated employees is now limited.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Business Asset Expensing. The TCJA allows taxpayers to immediately expense the entire cost (instead of only 50%, as under prior law) of certain depreciable tangible property and real property improvements acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023 (with an additional year for certain property). This 100% “bonus” depreciation is phased out proportionately for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2023 and before January 1, 2027 (with an additional year for certain property).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interest Expense. The TCJA limits a taxpayer’s annual deduction of business interest expense to the sum of (i) business interest income, plus (ii) 30% of “adjusted taxable income,” defined as a business’ taxable income without taking into account business interest income or expense, net operating losses, and, for 2018 through 2021, depreciation, amortization and depletion. Because the Bancorp generates significant amounts of net interest income, we do not expect to be impacted by this limitation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The foregoing description of the impact of the TCJA on the Bancorp should be read in conjunction with Note 8 – Income Taxes of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
