 Item 1. Business.
Overview
Trulieve Cannabis Corp. is a reporting issuer in the United States and Canada. The Company’s Subordinate Voting Shares (as hereinafter defined) are listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the symbol “TRUL” and are also traded in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market (“OTCQX”) under the symbol “TCNNF”.
Trulieve is a vertically integrated cannabis company and multi-state operator which currently holds licenses to operate in ten states and has received notice of intent to award a license in an eleventh state. Headquartered in Quincy, Florida, we are the market leader for quality medical cannabis products and services in Florida and we have market leading retail operations in Arizona and Pennsylvania. By providing innovative, high-quality products across our brand portfolio, we aim to be the brand of choice for medical and adult-use customers in all of the major markets that we serve. We operate in highly regulated markets that require expertise in cultivation, manufacturing, retail and logistics. We have developed proficiencies in each of these functions and are committed to expanding access to high quality cannabis products and delivering exceptional customer experiences.
 All of the states in which we operate have adopted legislation to permit the use of cannabis products for medicinal purposes to treat specific conditions and diseases, which we refer to as medical cannabis. Recreational marijuana, or adult-use cannabis, is legal marijuana sold in licensed dispensaries to adults ages 21 and older. Thus far, of the states in which we operate, only Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Nevada have adopted legislation permitting the commercialization of adult-use cannabis products. Trulieve operates its business through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries that hold licenses and have entered into managed service agreements in the states in which they operate. As of March 16, 2022, we operated 162 dispensaries, with 113 dispensaries in Florida, 19 affiliated dispensaries in Pennsylvania, 17 dispensaries in Arizona, five dispensaries in California, three dispensaries in Maryland, two dispensaries in Massachusetts, two dispensaries in West Virginia and one dispensary in Connecticut, and we operated cultivation and processing facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 9,000 people and we are committed to providing patients and adult consumers, which we refer to herein as “customers,” a consistent and welcoming retail experience across Trulieve branded stores and affiliated retail locations.
Our business and operations center around the Trulieve brand philosophy of “Customers First” which permeates our culture beginning with high- quality and efficient cultivation and manufacturing practices, focus on the consumer experience at Trulieve branded and affiliated retail locations, at our in-house call center and where available at customer residences through a robust home delivery program. Our investments in vertically integrated operations in several of our markets afford us ownership of the entire supply chain which mitigates third-party risks and allows us to completely control product quality and brand experience. We believe that this is contributive to high customer retention and brand loyalty. We successfully operate our core business functions of cultivation, production and distribution at scale, and are skilled at rapidly increasing capacity without any interruption to existing operations.
 Trulieve has identified five regional geographic hubs in the U.S. and has established cannabis operations in three of the five hubs: Southeast, Northeast, and Southwest. In each of our three regional hubs we have market leading positions in cornerstone states and additional operations and assets in other state markets. Our hubs are managed by national and regional management teams supported by our corporate headquarters in Florida.
 Southeast Hub
 Our southeast hub operations are anchored by our cornerstone market of Florida. Trulieve was the first licensed operator in the medical market in Florida with initial sales in 2016. Publicly available reports filed with the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use show Trulieve has the most dispensing locations and the greatest dispensing volume across product categories out of all licensed medical marijuana businesses in the state as of December 31, 2021. Trulieve cultivates and produces all of its products in-house and distributes those products to customers in Trulieve branded stores (dispensaries) throughout Florida, as well as via home delivery.
 In accordance with Florida law, Trulieve grows all of its cannabis in secure enclosed indoor facilities and greenhouse structures. In furtherance of our customer-first focus, we have developed a suite of Trulieve branded products, including flower, edibles, vaporizer cartridges, concentrates, topicals, capsules, tinctures, dissolvable powders, and nasal sprays. This wide variety of products gives customers the ability to select the product that consistently delivers the desired effect and in their preferred method of delivery. These products are delivered to customers statewide in Trulieve-branded retail stores and by home delivery.
In Georgia, Trulieve received a Notice of Intent to award a Class 1 Production License from the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission in July 2021. The Notice of Intent to award is a notice of the Georgia Access to Medical Cannabis Commission’s expected contract award to Trulieve GA pending resolution of a protest process. If the contract is awarded, Trulieve GA will hold one

of two Class 1 Production Licenses in the state and will be permitted to cultivate cannabis for the manufacture of low tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC oil.
 Northeast Hub
 Our northeast hub operations are anchored by our cornerstone market of Pennsylvania.
We conduct cultivation, processing, and retail operations through its direct and indirect subsidiaries with permits for retail operations and grower/processor operations in Pennsylvania. These subsidiaries operate cultivation and processing facilities in McKeesport, Reading, and Carmichael, Pennsylvania to support our affiliated network of retail dispensaries and wholesale distribution network across the state.
We operate three medical dispensaries and conducts wholesale sales supported by cultivation and processing in Hancock, Maryland.
 We operate two retail dispensaries in Massachusetts, serving medical patients and adult use customers in Northampton and adult use customers in Worcester. Our retail operations are supported by cultivation and manufacturing operations in Holyoke. We commenced wholesale sales in September 2021. Trulieve was the first to offer sales of clones supporting home grow for residents in the Massachusetts market in August 2021.
 We operate a medical cannabis dispensary located in Bristol, Connecticut. Under Connecticut’s adult-use cannabis legislation, which was enacted July 1, 2021, Trulieve can seek regulatory approval to expand sales at this dispensary to include adult use sales.
 We operate two medical dispensaries in Morgantown and Weston, West Virginia, supported by cultivation and processing operations in Huntington, West Virginia. Trulieve has been awarded and has acquired permits to operate up to a total of nine dispensaries in West Virginia.
 Southwest Hub
 Our southwest hub operations are anchored by our cornerstone market of Arizona. In Arizona, Trulieve holds a market-leading position, offering medical and adult use customers a wide range of branded and third-party products, including brand partner products, as well as offering wholesale across the state. We also serve medical and adult use customers in California. Trulieve conducts wholesale operations in Nevada and Colorado, serving the medical and adult use markets in each state.
Cultivation and Processing Capacity
 Trulieve produces high quality cannabis flower for direct consumption and uses a variety of processes to transform this high-quality biomass into the extensive portfolio of products sold in our stores and in our wholesale channels. Our prominence in our cornerstone market of Florida demonstrates the quality and affordability of the product we produce at scale. With a focus on replicable, scalable operations, we have detailed design standards, standard operating procedures, and training protocols that are employed across cultivation sites to achieve a high level of consistency and quality.
 In our cornerstone market of Florida, Trulieve cultivates, processes, and manufactures all cannabis products sold in our Florida dispensaries. In other markets including Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, we have achieved varying percentages of vertical integration with cultivation and processing operations to support our retail and wholesale businesses. Trulieve invests in a large number of in-house quality personnel as well as testing laboratories, both of which allow us to control quality in all aspects of our business while operating at scale.
 We utilize various extraction techniques including super critical ethanol extraction, carbon dioxide extraction, hydrocarbon extraction, and mechanical separation. We have invested in light hydrocarbon extraction processes, allowing for concentrates that preserve the natural ratios of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other target compounds to better replicate the flower experience. Light hydrocarbon extraction also offers the benefit of greater extraction yields in many cases. In addition, we own CO2 extraction, distillation, purification and manufacturing technology used to produce a line of cannabis topicals and vapes featuring cannabinoids and a hemp-derived product line sold in Colorado.
 Marketing and Community Outreach
 Trulieve’s marketing strategies are developed to maximize the unique opportunities of the markets in which we operate. In medical markets, our marketing efforts are centered around education and outreach for physicians and medical patients. Our educational materials are designed to help physicians understand cannabinoid science, the high standards pursuant to which our plants are cultivated, the processes required for regulatory compliance, and how our products provide relief for their patients. Our dedicated physician

education team delivers in-person outreach to hundreds of physicians each month as well as immediate phone support through a dedicated physician education team member in our call center. Patients primarily learn about us through their physicians, patient-centric community events, and digital marketing. We participate in dozens of outreach and community events on a monthly basis. An engaged audience is captured through our digital content marketing and via multiple popular social media platforms.
In adult use markets, our marketing efforts drive awareness of the Trulieve brand as well as our branded product portfolio directly to the end customer. Our marketing towards customers who are more familiar with cannabis products requires different strategies that inspire, tap into relevant cultural moments in their lives, build community as well as educate on our products’ uniqueness versus our competitors.
 A core element of our strategy centers around the distribution of branded products through our retail locations and wholesale channels. We strive to set a high standard for excellence and deliver excellent customer experiences in our retail locations. We have developed and acquired a portfolio of our own branded retail products that we cultivate, manufacture and distribute in our regional hubs. Trulieve brands include premium tier brands Avenue, Cultivar Collection, and Muse; mid-tier brands Modern Flower, Alchemy, Momenta, and Sweet Talk, and value tier brands Co2lors, Loveli, and Roll One. We have a dedicated research and development team focused on product development and technological innovation. Our R&D team evaluates new technologies and performs rigorous testing prior to recommending new products for introduction into production. The team monitors developments in the fast-paced cannabis industry and adjacent industries to help us remain competitive.
 We have also developed relationships with brand partners that allow for the sale of partner branded products in select markets and retail locations. Brand partnerships include arrangements with Bellamy Brothers, Bhang, Binske, Black Tuna, Blue River, Connected, El Blunto, Love’s Oven, Moxie, SLANG, and Sunshine Cannabis.
 It is our goal to generate brand loyalty by providing customers with industry-leading branded products and superior service in an appealing, approachable setting. We accomplish this goal through several key strategies: training; branded store experiences; brand awareness; multiple channels of distribution; our loyalty program and 360 brand activation that builds community across platforms.
 Customer experience is an area of significant focus for Trulieve. We employ and continuously improve numerous training programs and methods to provide our front-line workers with the resources and information they need to provide customers with an excellent experience across all Trulieve locations. We offer specialized management training so there is daily reinforcement of customer experience best practices.
As part of our customer centric approach, in select markets we offer various purchase options, including phone ordering, online ordering, home delivery, and in store.
 Our Truliever loyalty program provides customers the ability to earn points for dollars spent and receive discounts when their points exceed specified thresholds. Trulievers are also the first to be informed about special discounts or limited product releases and they are invited to exclusive promotions and events. We understand each consumer has unique communication preferences and capabilities. As such, we engage with customers and physicians through a variety of methods including email, text, social media and online chat. In all markets, we engage with various communities who may benefit, such as veterans, seniors, organizations that serve qualifying populations, and various health and wellness groups. Search engine optimization of our website also captures potential customers researching the benefits of medical marijuana, which offers another pathway to informative materials about therapeutic uses of cannabis, our products and how to legally access them.
 
Recent Developments
 
Harvest Acquisition
 
On May 10, 2021, the Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Harvest Health & Recreation Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“Harvest”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Harvest (the “Arrangement”). On October 1, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of Harvest pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement. On the Closing Date, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares, multiple voting shares and super voting shares (collectively the “Harvest Shares”) of Harvest. Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, holders of Harvest Shares received 0.1170 of a Subordinate Voting Share of the Company for each Harvest Share held. In total, the Company issued an aggregate of 50,921,236 Trulieve Shares, representing total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion based on the closing price of Trulieve’s Subordinate Voting Shares on September 30, 2021.
 Prior to the acquisition, Harvest was one of the largest multi-state vertically integrated operators in the cannabis industry in the United States operating from “seed to sale.” Harvest is one of the largest operators in the state of Arizona, which is one of the largest medical and recreational cannabis markets in the country and one of the oldest regulated cannabis markets in the world. Harvest operates

facilities or provides services to cannabis dispensaries in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada and Pennsylvania. In addition, Harvest owns CO2 extraction, distillation, purification and manufacturing technology used to produce a line of cannabis topicals, vapes and gems featuring cannabinoids and a hemp-derived product line sold in Colorado. We expect the Harvest acquisition will have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2021 and in future periods as we integrate Harvest’s business with our existing operations.

 Competitive Conditions and Position
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive markets with relatively high barriers to entry given the licensed nature of the cannabis industry. See “—Regulatory Overview” below for additional information regarding the impact of regulation on our business. Trulieve competes directly with cannabis producers and retailers within single-state operating markets, as well as those that operate across several U.S. markets.
The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in our markets consist of localized or regional businesses with operations in a single state market. Other multi-state cannabis operators compete directly in several of our operating markets. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter those markets through acquisitions are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as we execute on our regional hub strategy and expand across the U.S., operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We face additional competition from new entrants. If the number of consumers of medical and adult use cannabis in our markets increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. We expect to continue to invest in several areas, including product development and innovation, marketing and branding, sales and distribution and customer service and retention. Trulieve may not have sufficient resources to maintain investments on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 See Item 1A—“Risk Factors” with respect to competition.
 Key Business Objectives
Trulieve will continue to focus on achieving our vision and mission to be a leading customer-focused cannabis brand in the U.S., with depth in select markets with favorable attributes relative to our strategic vision. We aim to provide the highest level of cannabis products and customer experience through authentic and reciprocal relationships.
 Our strategic priorities include the following:
  Developing exceptional customer experiences and building brand loyalty through:
▪Providing superb service, expedient transactions, frictionless returns; and
 ▪Innovating across product and consumer categories
  Continuing to execute on our hub strategy by:
 ▪Building additional scale and depth in our cornerstone markets of Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania;
 ▪Expanding operations as appropriate in new and existing markets; and
 ▪Pursuing organic license awards and strategic acquisition opportunities
  Distributing branded products through branded retail locations and wholesale network by:
 ▪Expanding distribution of branded products through branded retail locations;
 ▪Converting acquired, affiliated, and/or operated retail locations to Trulieve branded retail; and
 ▪Developing and expanding wholesale channels with initial emphasis on Arizona, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Pennsylvania markets
  Focusing on profitable growth and prudent capital allocation.


Trulieve Leases
 We own or lease our facility locations including cultivation, processing, retail and corporate office locations. We do not have any one lease representing over 10% of our consolidated leasing costs and, as a result, do not consider any of our leases to be material. In Florida, we have 111 operational dispensaries, of which 109 are leased, and we have fourteen cultivation, manufacturing and distribution facilities, of which six are leased. In Arizona, we have seventeen operational dispensaries, of which thirteen are leased. In California, we have five operational dispensaries, of which three are leased. We have a single operational manufacturing facility in Colorado that is leased. We have one operational dispensary in Connecticut that is leased. In Georgia, we own land that is in the process of being developed into a cultivation facility. In Massachusetts, we operate two operational dispensaries, both of which are leased, and operate two separate cultivation properties, one of which is leased. We have three operational dispensaries in Maryland, of which two are leased, and we also operate a cultivation, manufacturing and distribution facility on adjacent leased properties. In Nevada, we lease a single cultivation, distribution and manufacturing facility. In Pennsylvania, there are eighteen operational affiliated dispensaries, seventeen of which are leased, and there are three affiliated cultivation and manufacturing facilities, of which a portion of one is leased. In West Virginia, we have two dispensaries and a cultivation facility that are leased and we own real property where additional cultivation operations are being be developed.
Specialized Skills
 We recruit talented individuals to join the Trulieve team. Our employees have a wide range of skill sets, including employees with PhD and master’s degrees. Many of our employees are college graduates and have specific skills related to their job function. We intend to continue to build out our research and development team with scientists and other technical specialists. We use a variety of recruiting techniques, including online resources as well as recruiting professionals, to assist with filling specialized roles.
 Supply Chain
We have varying degrees of vertical operations in the markets in which we operate. In the Florida market, our operations are fully vertically integrated as required by state regulations. In other markets we may operate within one or more segment of the cannabis value chain. In the normal course of our business we purchase input materials and components that we utilize in the cultivation, processing, manufacture and distribution of our products. No individual suppliers represent a significant portion of our purchases or represent a material risk to our operations.
Brand Recognition and Intellectual Property
 We have built brand recognition throughout our markets. One of our key business objectives is to build brand equity in the Trulieve brand name through our branded retail stores and interactions with our customers. We intend to rebrand acquired and affiliated locations over time as part of our plan to expand our branded retail reach. Trulieve maintains a consistent approach to the design of its retail stores and endeavors to create a uniform experience for its customers.
 We regularly seek to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with our operating names and our brand names. The U.S. trademark statute, The Lanham Act, allows for the protection of trademarks and service marks on products and services used, or intended for use, lawfully. Because cannabis-related products and services remain illegal at the federal level under the Controlled Substances Act, we are not able to fully protect our intellectual property at the federal level; therefore, we currently seek trademark protections at the state level where commercially feasible. Nonetheless, our success depends upon other areas of our business such as product development and design, production and marketing and not exclusively upon trademarks and trade secrets.
 We have developed proprietary cultivation techniques. We have also developed certain proprietary intellectual property for production best practices, procedures and methods. This requires specialized skills in cultivation, extraction and refining.
 We rely on non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Where commercially feasible, we will proactively seek intellectual property protection for newly developed brands as well as for expansion of existing brands across current markets and into new markets. We own several website domains numerous, social media accounts across all major platforms and various phone and web application platforms.
 Year-Round Business
 Our business operates year-round. Operations and sales trends in select markets where we operate do follow seasonal trends with various times of the year providing an opportunity for outdoor cultivation, seasonal impacts on sales in summer and winter months in markets in the Southwest and Northeast and promotional activity increases around specific industry and holiday events.


Diversity, Inclusion & Equity (DE&I)
 We are committed to contributing positively to the legal cannabis industry. As a business that produces and distributes a product that many people– especially people of color – were arrested and incarcerated for in the past, we recognize the supreme importance of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the cannabis industry. As such, we have hired a Director of DE&I and continue to support a DE&I Committee comprised of executives, senior management, and employees throughout the Company. The DE&I Committee is charged with implementing and recording the efficacy of our efforts to recruit and develop diverse talent, implement company-wide diversity and cultural competency training, increase supplier diversity, engage in social justice initiatives and more.
 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
 As a purpose-driven company, ESG is integral to our growth and corporate achievements. Our commitment to ESG makes us better planners, cultivators, and retailers, supports transparency and strong governance, contributes to improved safety and environmental performance, and strengthens our connection with local communities. We have established governance policies and management systems, such as our SAP system implemented last year, to codify our responsibilities and help manage risk across the company. We also implemented other measures including environmental safeguards at our cultivation facilities, recycling initiatives, and safety training for security personnel at our dispensaries.
 Regulatory Overview
 Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently directly involved, through our subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry.
Federal Regulation of Cannabis in the United States
 The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act or CSA. Marijuana, which refers to certain parts and derivatives of the cannabis plant, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, customers, and others. Moreover, as of December 31, 2021, and despite the conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 36 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have legalized marijuana for medical use. Eighteen of those states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have legalized the adult use of cannabis for recreational purposes. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalize marijuana for medical use, although South Dakota’s adult-use measure has been declared unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court. In 2021, the states of Connecticut, New Mexico, New York, and Virginia enacted laws legalizing the adult use of cannabis.
 Marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana conflict with the CSA, making marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in those states where we maintain such licenses, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us.
 In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of DOJ memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum.
 The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations, and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard with which marijuana-related businesses would comply. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:
 
1. Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
 2. Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;


3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;\
 4. Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
 6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
 7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
 8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.
 On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and other Department of Justice memorandums providing prosecutorial guidance on state and tribally authorized medical and adult-use cannabis activities and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well- established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.
 On January 21, 2021, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the United States. President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice, under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. During his Senate confirmation, Merrick Garland told Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), “It does not seem to me useful the use of limited resources that we have to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” Such statements are not official declarations or policies of the DOJ and are not binding on the DOJ, any United States Attorney, or the United States federal courts. Substantial uncertainty regarding United States federal enforcement remains. To date, there have been no new federal cannabis memorandums issued by the Biden Administration or any published change in federal enforcement policy.
 Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned or that local government authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments, there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole Memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
 As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we abide by the following standard operating policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
 
1. Continuously monitor our operations for compliance with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
 
2. Ensure that our cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements);
 
3. Implement policies and procedures to prevent the distribution of our cannabis products to minors;
 
4. Implement policies and procedures in place to avoid the distribution of the proceeds from our operations to criminal enterprises, gangs, or cartels;
 
5. Implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to reliably track inventory and prevent the diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law or across any state lines in general;
 
6. Monitor the operations at our facilities so that our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs or engaging in any other illegal activity; and
 

7. Implement quality controls so that our products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to avoid adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and discourage impaired driving.
 
In addition, we frequently conduct background checks to confirm that the principals and management of our operating subsidiaries are of good character and have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or the use of firearms in the cultivation, manufacturing, or distribution of cannabis. We also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of our cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures related to the possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises.
 Moreover, in recent years, certain temporary federal legislative enactments that protect the medical marijuana and hemp industries have also been in effect. For instance, certain marijuana businesses receive a measure of protection from federal prosecution by operation of temporary appropriations measures that have been enacted into law as amendments (or “riders”) to federal spending bills passed by Congress and signed by Presidents Obama, Trump, and, most recently, President Biden. For instance, in the Appropriations Act of 2015, Congress included a budget “rider” that prohibits DOJ from expending any funds to enforce any law that interferes with a state’s implementation of its own medical marijuana laws. The rider originally known as the “Rohrbacher-Farr” Amendment after its original lead sponsors is now known as the “Joyce” Amendment after its current sponsor. Originally, a Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate passed the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment. The bill was “a bipartisan appropriations measure that looks to prohibit the DEA from spending funds to arrest state-licensed medical marijuana patients and providers.” Subsequently, the rider t has been included in multiple budgets passed by successive Congresses controlled by both major political parties. Most recently, on February 18, 2022, the Amendment was renewed through the signing of an additional stopgap spending bill, H.R.6617 - Further Additional Extending Government Funding Act, effective through March 11, 2022. While the Amendment has been included in successive appropriations legislation or resolutions since 2015, its inclusion or non-inclusion is subject to political change.
 Notably, Joyce Amendment has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. If the Amendment is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana laws would increase.
 United States Border Entry
 The United States Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, enforces the laws of the United States as they pertain to lawful travel and trade into and out of the U.S. Crossing the border while in violation of the CSA and other related United States federal laws may result in denied admission, seizures, fines, and apprehension. CBP officers administer determine the admissibility of travelers who are non-U.S. citizens into the United States pursuant to the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. An investment in our Subordinate Voting Shares, if it became known to CBP, could have an impact on a non-U.S. citizen’s admissibility into the United States and could lead to a lifetime ban on admission.
 Because marijuana remains illegal under United States federal law, those investing in Canadian companies with operations in the United States cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry, or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with United States marijuana businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of CBP officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a non-US citizen or foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers that previous use of marijuana, or any substance prohibited by United States federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the marijuana industry in the United States could also be reason enough for CBP to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada’s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances and because marijuana continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal may affect admissibility to the United States. As a result, CBP has affirmed that employees, directors, officers, managers, and investors of companies involved in business activities related to marijuana in the United States (such as Trulieve), who are not United States citizens, face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States.
 Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Access to Banking
 The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve anti-money laundering, financial recordkeeping, and the proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (referred to herein as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States.
 Additionally, under United States federal law, it may potentially be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of any Schedule I controlled substance. For example, banks and other financial

institutions could potentially be prosecuted and convicted of aiding and abetting money laundering under the Bank Secrecy Act for providing services to cannabis businesses. Therefore, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other financial service could be charged with money laundering or conspiracy.
 While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to accommodate businesses in the large and increasing number of U.S. states that have legalized medical or adult-use marijuana, The U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network “FinCEN” issued guidance in 2014 and was not rescinded by the Sessions Memo. The FinCEN Guidance provided guidance to financial institutions on how to engage with state and tribally authorized cannabis entities in accordance with federal law. An additional Department of Justice memorandum, issued in parallel with the FinCEN Guidance and since rescinded as part of the Sessions Memo, provided guidance to prosecutors regarding money laundering and other financial crimes as it pertained to cannabis entities and financial institutions operating in accordance with the FinCEN Guidance. The FinCEN Guidance and now rescinded accompanying Department of Justice memorandum is often publicly viewed as enabling a way for financial institutions to work with cannabis entities in compliance with federal law so long as that cannabis-related business activities are legal in their state or territory and none of the federal enforcement priorities referenced in the Cole Memorandum are being violated (such as keeping marijuana out of the hands of organized crime). Importantly, the FinCEN Guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide financial services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including enhanced customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk. The customer due diligence steps typically include:
 
1. Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered;
 
2. Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business;
 
3. Requesting available information about the business and related parties from state licensing and enforcement authorities;
 
4. Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus adult-use customers);
 
5. Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties;
 
6. Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in the FinCEN Guidance; and
 
7. Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk.
 With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.
 While the FinCEN Guidance decreased some risk for banks and financial institutions considering servicing the cannabis industry, in practice, challenges remain with financial institutions’ willingness to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. This is because current U.S. federal law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution. It also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence (i.e., enhanced due diligence) on each marijuana-related business they accept as a customer.
 Those commercial banks and/or credit unions that have agreed to work with marijuana businesses are typically limiting those accounts to small percentages of their total deposits to avoid creating liquidity and concentration risk. Since, theoretically, the federal government could change the banking laws as it relates to marijuana-related businesses at any time and without notice, these banks and credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from marijuana-related businesses in a single day, while also keeping sufficient liquid capital on hand to service their other customers. Because many banks and credit unions that are providing banking services to marijuana-related businesses are smaller institutions, applicable concentration limits may also impose limits on the aggregate amounts of loans that might be provided to the industry. Those commercial banks and credit unions that do have customers in the marijuana industry can charge marijuana businesses high fees to cover the added cost of ensuring compliance with the FinCEN Guidance.
 As mentioned previously, unlike the Cole Memorandum, the FinCEN Guidance has not been rescinded. FinCEN has stated that it views the FinCEN Guidance to include compliance with the requirements of the rescinded Cole Memorandum. Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, has not made any public statements with regards to how the Treasury Department plans to treat marijuana-related businesses.


As an industry best practice and consistent with its standard operating procedures, Trulieve adheres to all customer due diligence steps in the FinCEN Guidance and any additional requirements imposed by those financial institutions it utilizes. However, in the event that any of our operations, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such operations in the United States were found to be in violation of anti-money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions could be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize our ability to declare or pay dividends or affect other distributions.
 In the United States, the “SAFE Banking Act” was adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives, which would grant banks and other financial institutions immunity from federal criminal prosecution for servicing marijuana-related businesses if the underlying marijuana business follows state law. It is unclear whether the U.S. Senate will take up the SAFE Banking Act for a vote. Most recently, the SAFE Banking Act was included as an amendment to the House of Representatives’ versions of the National Defense Authorization Act, “NDAA,” and the America COMPETES Act. During the conference committee, the committee declined to include the SAFE Banking Act amendment in the version of the NDAA signed into law. The America COMPETES Act is still being considered by Congress. While there is strong support in the public and within Congress for the SAFE Banking Act and similar legislation, there can be no assurance that it will be passed as presently proposed or at all. In both Canada and the United States, transactions involving banks and other financial institutions are both difficult and unpredictable under the current legal and regulatory landscape. Legislative changes could help to reduce or eliminate these challenges for companies in the cannabis space and would improve the efficiency of both significant and minor financial transactions.
 Ability to Access Public and Private Capital
 Given the current laws regarding cannabis at the federal level in the United States, traditional bank financing is typically not available to United States marijuana companies (although there has been a recent increase in the availability of traditional loans from alternative lending providers). Specifically, since financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under anti-money laundering statutes, the unlicensed money transmitter statute, and the Bank Secrecy Act, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Banks that do accept deposits from cannabis-related businesses in the United States must do so in compliance with the FinCEN Guidance. We have banking relationships in the states where we operate with state-chartered banks for deposits and payroll; however, we have limited access to traditional bank financing.
Tax Concerns
 An additional challenge for marijuana-related businesses is that the provisions of IRC Section 280E are being applied by the IRS to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use marijuana industry. IRC Section 280E prohibits marijuana businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a marijuana business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be. Furthermore, although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of the cost of goods sold, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted.
The 2018 Farm Bill
 CBD is a nonintoxicating chemical found in cannabis and is often derived from hemp, which contains, at most, only trace amounts of THC. On December 20, 2018, Former President Trump signed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (popularly known as the 2018 Farm Bill) into law. Until the 2018 Farm Bill became law, hemp fell within the definition of “marijuana” under the CSA, and the DEA classified hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance because hemp is part of the cannabis plant.
 The 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of the plant with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% by dry weight and removes hemp from the CSA. The 2018 Farm Bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, to, among other things: (1) evaluate and approve regulatory plans approved by individual states for the cultivation and production of industrial hemp, and (2) promulgate regulations and guidelines to establish and administer a program for the cultivation and production of hemp in the U.S. On October 29, 2019, the USDA published its interim rules for the regulation of hemp, and on January 15, 2021, published its final rule for hemp production (referred to herein as the “USDA Rule”). The USDA Rule became effective on March 22, 2021. The USDA Rule, among other things, sets minimum standards for the cultivation and production of hemp, as well as requirements for laboratory testing of hemp. The hemp production regulations promulgated by the USDA are in lieu of those states not adopting state-specific hemp regulations; however, state programs must meet certain requirements contained in the USDA Rule. Hemp and products derived from it, such as CBD, may be sold into commerce and transported across state lines provided that the hemp from which any product is derived was cultivated under a license issued by an authorized state program approved by the USDA or USDA hemp production license, meets the definition of hemp, and the products are compliant with other applicable federal laws including the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserved the authority of the FDA to regulate

hemp-derived products under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA has not yet promulgated its own rules for the regulation of hemp-derived products.
 Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States
 We are classified as having “direct” involvement in the United States cannabis industry, and we believe that we are in compliance with applicable state laws, as well as related licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted in the states we operate in. We are not subject to any citations or notices of violation with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks which may have an impact on our licenses, business activities, or operations. We use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that our business remains compliant with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted by Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia through the advice of our Director of Compliance, who monitors and reviews our business practices and changes to applicable state laws and regulations, as well as United States Federal enforcement priorities. Our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel work with external legal advisors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Nevada, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to ensure that we are in ongoing compliance with applicable state laws.
 In the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Although each state in which we operate (and anticipate operating) authorizes, as applicable, medical and/or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, and numerous other states have legalized marijuana in some form, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia remains illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under U.S. federal law. Although we believe that our business activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws of the United States, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to marijuana may neither absolve us of liability under U.S. federal law nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against us. Any such proceedings brought against us may result in a material adverse effect on our business.
 Regulation of the Medical and Adult-Use Cannabis Markets in Arizona
 In December 2010, Arizona voters passed the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (the “AMMA”), A.R.S. Section 36- 2801 et seq. The AMMA went into effect on April 14, 2011, making Arizona the fifteenth state to adopt a medical marijuana law. The AMMA designates the Arizona Department of Health Services (the “ADHS”) as the licensing and issuing authority for the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program. The ADHS has adopted rules and regulations for developing and implementing the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program. These rules and regulations are set forth in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9, Chapter 17.
 The first medical marijuana licenses in Arizona were issued in 2012 and as of March 1, 2022, Arizona has 127 open dispensaries.
 Arizona Proposition 207, also known as the Smart and Safe Arizona Act, was a voter initiative to legalize the adult recreational use of marijuana that was approved by voters on November 3, 2020. The Smart and Safe Arizona Act directed the Arizona State Department of Health Services to establish rules for retail marijuana sales by June 1, 2021, allow marijuana to be subject to state and local sales taxes like other retail items, and would impose an additional 16% excise tax on marijuana products. Following the passage of Proposition 207, existing medical operators were permitted to apply for licensure to permit sales to adult use consumers. Recreational sales commenced in Arizona on January 22, 2021.

Arizona Licenses and Regulations
 Arizona state licenses are renewed once every two years. Around the time of renewal, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by the ADHS. While renewals are annual, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner (at least 30 days in advance of the expiration date of the license), and there are no material violations noted against the applicable licenses, we would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. While our compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that our licenses will be renewed in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede our ongoing or planned operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
 Arizona is a vertically integrated system so that each license permits the holder to acquire, cultivate, process, distribute and/or dispense, deliver, manufacture, transfer, and supply medical and/or adult-use marijuana in compliance with the AMMA and ADHS rules and regulations.
 

Dispensing Requirements
 In order to dispense medical marijuana to a qualifying customer or designated caregiver, a licensed dispensary is required to (1) verify the qualifying customer’s or designated caregiver’s identity, (2) offer appropriate customer education or support materials, (3) make available testing results related to the product sought, if requested by the qualifying customer or designated caregiver, (4) enter the qualifying customer’s or designated caregiver’s registry identification number on the identification card presented into the medical marijuana electronic verification system, (5) verify the validity of the identification card presented, (6) verify that the amount of marijuana product to be dispensed would not cause the qualifying customer to exceed the regulatory limit, and (7) enter information into the medical marijuana electronic verification system regarding the amount of medical marijuana dispensed, whether it was dispensed directly to the qualifying customer or to a caregiver, the date and time of dispensing, the registry identification number of the dispensary agent, and the dispensary’s registry identification number.
Requirements Relating to Recordkeeping and Inventory Control
 Licensed dispensaries are required by regulation to utilize an inventory control system that documents (1) daily updated inventory amounts of marijuana products, (2) acquisitions of medical marijuana from qualifying customers or designated caregivers, (3) acquisitions of medical marijuana from other dispensaries, (4) information related to batches of marijuana cultivated by the licensee, (5) information regarding provision of medical marijuana to other dispensaries, (6) information relating to required testing of marijuana products, and (7) the disposition of marijuana products determined not to be dispensed to a customer or to be included in manufacturing a marijuana product. Licensed dispensaries are additionally required to keep records regarding qualifying customers that: (1) include dated entries from registered dispensary agents regarding dispensing, (2) are safeguarded against unauthorized access and tampering, (3) include documentation of requests by qualifying customers and caregivers regarding marijuana products and educational materials.
Requirements Relating to Security and Transportation
 Licensed dispensaries are permitted to transport marijuana and marijuana products between dispensaries and cultivation sites, qualifying customers, other dispensaries, and licensed analytical laboratories. Dispensaries are required to complete a comprehensive trip plan prior to transport that describes the products being transported, the time of the trip, and the anticipated route. During transportation, dispensary agents are required to use unmarked vehicles, hide marijuana and marijuana products from view, and communicate with the licensed dispensary. Licensed dispensaries are required to keep records of trip plans.
 Licensed dispensaries are also required to implement a variety of security measures to protect dispensary and cultivation sites from unauthorized access: (1) intrusion detection devices, (2) exterior lighting, (3) video cameras covering the entrances and exits of limited access areas and facilities, as well as point of sale locations and grow rooms, (4) failure notification systems, (5) battery backup for cameras and other equipment, and (6) panic buttons on the interior of facilities. Licensed dispensaries are also required to implement policies and procedures that restrict access to the areas of the dispensary that contain marijuana, that provide for identification of authorized individuals, that prevent loitering, for the conduct of electronic monitoring, and the use of panic buttons.
 
Arizona Reporting Requirements
 The State of Arizona uses the ADHS Medical Marijuana Verification System (“ADHS MMV”) to validate card holders, verify allotment amounts and track all retail transactions for Arizona qualified customers. The ADHS MMV system is also used annually by license holders to renew the dispensary registration certificate.
 We use Leaf Logix software as our computerized, seed-to-sale tracking and inventory system. Individual licensees whether directly or through third- party integration systems are required to capture and retain all information pertaining to the acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacturing, delivery, transfer, transportation, supplying, selling, distributing, or dispensing of medical marijuana, to meet all reporting requirements for the State of Arizona.
 
ADHS Inspections
 In December 2010, Arizona voters passed the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (the “AMMA”), A.R.S. Section 36- 2801 et seq. The AMMA went into effect on April 14, 2011, making Arizona the fifteenth state to adopt a medical marijuana law. The AMMA designates the Arizona Department of Health Services (the “ADHS”) as the licensing and issuing authority for the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program. The ADHS has adopted rules and regulations for developing and implementing the Arizona Medical Marijuana Program. These rules and regulations are set forth in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9, Chapter 17. Arizona Proposition 207, also known as the Smart and Safe Arizona Act, was a voter initiative to legalize the adult recreational use of marijuana that was approved by voters on November 3, 2020. Following the passage of Proposition 207, existing medical operators were permitted to apply for licensure to permit sales to adult use consumers. Recreational sales commenced in Arizona on January 22, 2021. In accordance with Proposition 207, the ADHS will issue up to 26 additional licenses for social equity applicants in the future.

The ADHS oversees licensing for medical marijuana and adult-use cannabis. The Arizona market is divided into two classes of licenses: medical and adult use. Each license grants the licensee the ability to have one dispensary, one processing site, and one cultivation site. License holders are not required to establish for vertically integrated operations and processing and cultivation sites can be used by third party companies. Arizona does not recognize third party operators and the license holder is responsible for compliance. As of December 31, 2021, there were 127 operating dispensaries. Dispensaries can hold dual licensure to serve both medical and adult use consumers.
For medical card holders, qualifying conditions include Alzheimer’s disease, cachexia, cancer, chronic pain, Crohn’s disease, glaucoma, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (“AIDS”), muscle spasms, nausea, post-traumatic stress disorder “(PTSD”), sclerosis, and seizures. All product categories are allowed to be sold as either adult use or medical, except edibles for adult use consumers, which cannot be more than 10mg per serving or 100mg per package.
 Regulation of the Marijuana Market in California
 In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This provided an affirmative defense for defendants charged with the use, possession, and cultivation of medical marijuana by customers with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law, decriminalizing the use, possession, and collective cultivation of medical marijuana and establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana customers.
 In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (“MMRSA”). The MMRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created testing laboratories and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturer licenses based on either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing-specific extraction methodology also became mandatory. Multiple agencies oversaw different aspects of the program, and businesses were required to obtain both a state license and local approval in order to operate.
 However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”), creating an adult-use marijuana program for consumers 21 years of age or older. In June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which amalgamated MMRSA and AUMA into a set of regulations governing both medical and adult-use cannabis licensing in California. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018.
 The three licensing agencies that used to regulate marijuana at the state level included the Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”), California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CDFA”), and the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”). However, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 141 (“AB 141”) on July 12, 2021. Effectively, AB 141 consolidated the three former state cannabis authorities into a single, new department now known as the Department of Cannabis Control (the “Department”). On or about September 15, 2021, the Department filed emergency regulations to consolidate, clarify, and make consistent cannabis regulations to the California Office of Administrative Law. After a limited comment period, these consolidated emergency regulations were approved and became effective on or about September 27, 2021. These regulations created consistent standards for cannabis licensees across all license types by aligning application requirements, unifying terminology, and clarifying ownership and financial interest requirements.
 One of the central features of MAUCRSA is known as “local control.” In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use marijuana business in California, an operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license-holders to operate in cities or counties with marijuana licensing programs. Cities and counties in California are also allowed to limit the number of licenses issued locally or even ban all cannabis licenses completely.
 Once an operator obtains local approval, the operator must obtain state licenses before conducting any commercial marijuana activity. There are multiple license categories that cover all commercial activity. Categories include: (1) cultivation/nurseries/processors, (2) testing laboratories, (3) distributors/transporters, (4) retailers (including delivery), (5) microbusinesses, (6) event organizers, and (7) manufacturers. Categories of licenses are further broken down into subtypes. For example, there are multiple types of cultivation licenses available depending upon the size of the cultivation operation and whether the operation is indoors/outdoors or uses mixed lighting. Different manufacturing licenses are available depending upon whether volatile or nonvolatile solvents are used. Retail licenses are available depending upon whether the retailer operates from a storefront or a non-storefront.
 
The Department Regulating the Commercial Cannabis Industry
 The Department oversees and regulates all commercial cannabis activities. Operators must apply to the Department for their licenses.


The Marijuana Supply Chain in California
 In California, local law may determine whether plants must be cultivated outdoors, using mixed-light methods, or fully indoors. Cultivators must also obtain seeds, clones, teens, or other immature plants from licensed nurseries through the traceability system.
 The cultivation, processing, and movement of marijuana within the state are tracked by the California Cannabis Track and Trace System’s METRC software. All licensees are required to input their track and trace data (either manually or using another software that automatically uploads to METRC). Immature plants must be assigned a Unique Identifier number (“UID”) which then remains associated with that specific plant’s flowers and biomass as it moves through the supply chain to the consumer. Each licensee in the supply chain is required to meticulously log any processing, packaging, and sales associated with that UID.
 When marijuana plants mature and complete their life cycle, they are harvested, cured, and trimmed in preparation for being sold to processors, distributors, or manufacturers. Cultivators have two main products: flowers, or “buds,” and the biomass, or “trim,” which is typically removed from the mature flowers. Trim is commonly sold to manufacturers for further processing into cannabis extracts. Buds may also be sold to manufacturers or distributors for sale to retailers. The cultivator may package and label its marijuana flowers directly or sell flowers in bulk, allowing distributors to package and label the flower.
 Manufactured marijuana goods sold or transferred to a distributor for final retail sale by a manufacturer must be in final packaging. Distributors may not repackage manufactured marijuana goods. Certain tax rates apply to the marijuana flower and biomass, which are assessed per ounce of product sold. The California State cultivation tax is paid by the cultivator to the distributor, or, alternatively, from the cultivator to the manufacturer, after which the distributor bringing the marijuana goods to market bears responsibility for tendering the cultivation tax receipts to the California Department of Tax Fee Administration (“CDTFA”).
 California restricts the transportation of cannabis to licensed distributors. Some cultivators and manufacturers maintain their own distribution licenses in order to handle transportation directly, while others contract with third-party licensed distributors for transportation services. Distributors may or may not take possession of the marijuana and marijuana products, and like alcohol distribution, some retailers limit sales to a particular distributor’s brand portfolio. Brands may market products to retailers directly or only to distributors.
 Distributors are the point in the supply chain where final quality assurance testing is performed on products before they go to a retailer. Retailers may not accept or sell products without an accompanying and compliant Certificate of Analysis (“COA”). Distributors must clearly segregate the product awaiting testing from the product that has already passed testing at their licensed premises until an employee of a licensed testing laboratory comes to their premises and obtains samples from any and all goods proposed to be sold at retail. Marijuana and marijuana products are issued either a “pass” or “fail” by the testing laboratory. Under some circumstances, the Department’s regulations allow for failing product to be “remediated” or to be re-labeled to more accurately reflect the COA results.
 
Retail Compliance in California
 California requires specific warnings, images, and information regarding package contents to be printed on all marijuana packaging. The Department’s regulations also require packaging to be both tamper-evident and child-resistant. Distributors and retailers are independently responsible for confirming that products are properly labeled and packaged prior to the consumer sale.
 Consumers aged 21 and up may purchase marijuana in California from a dispensary with an “adult-use” license. Some localities still only allow medicinal dispensaries. Consumers aged 18 and up with a valid physician’s recommendation may purchase marijuana from a medicinal-only dispensary or an adult-use dispensary. Consumers without valid physician’s recommendations may not purchase marijuana from a medicinal-only dispensary. All marijuana businesses are prohibited from hiring employees under the age of 21.

Inspections
 All licensees are subject to random inspections of their premises by the Department. If an inspection identifies any noncompliance of a licensee, the Department may issue notices to correct, or notices of violation, fines, or take other disciplinary action that may include cancellation of a license.
Retail Taxes in California
 Retailers generally pay excise tax amounts to final distributors upon making wholesale purchases. These distributors then remit receipts directly to the CDTFA. The tax liability is calculated based on the average market price of the cannabis goods sold at retail sale. The average market price is determined by the type of transaction that occurs between the seller (cultivator, manufacturer, or distributor) and the retailer. The CDTFA determines tax rates based upon estimated average ratios, including retail and wholesale prices during the tax period, and is commonly known as a “markup.” CDTFA’s current markup estimate (as of January 1, 2020) is 80%. Due to the 15% statutory tax rate and the 80% markup estimate, the current effective tax rate on wholesale gross receipts is 27%.
 In addition to the State taxes, cities and counties throughout California with licensed cannabis businesses apply their own approaches to taxing cannabis. These approaches fall into three broad categories. First, many local governments impose the same tax rate on all cannabis businesses regardless of type. Second, many local governments impose higher tax rates on retailers than other types of cannabis businesses. Third, a few local governments do not levy specific cannabis taxes. The California Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates that the average cumulative local tax rate over the whole supply chain is roughly equivalent to a 15% tax on retail sales.
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in California.
Regulation of Cannabis Market in Colorado
 In 2000, Colorado voters passed Amendment 20, an amendment to the state constitution decriminalizing certain amounts of marijuana for medicinal purposes. The amendment created a regulatory system for granting patient registry cards authorizing individuals with debilitating medical conditions to have and use up to two ounces of a usable form of marijuana and no more than six marijuana plants. The amendment also created a regulatory system for granting patient registry cards authorizing individuals with debilitating medical conditions to have and use limited quantities of marijuana, and an affirmative defense under Colorado criminal law for any cardholder or their primary caregiver to charges of violating state drugs laws. In 2010, the Colorado legislature passed H.B. 10-1284, which enacted the Colorado Medical Marijuana Code, a framework regulating the growth, sale, and distribution of marijuana by licensed dispensaries, administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
 In 2012, Colorado voted passed Amendment 64, legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in Colorado. Among other provisions, the amendment legalized the cultivation, manufacturing, processing, and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. Amendment 64 also directed the Colorado Department of Revenue (“DOR”) to establish a comprehensive framework of regulation and enforcement governing licensed marijuana businesses in the state. The Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division (“MED”) is the licensing and regulatory agency overseeing all recreational and medical marijuana businesses in Colorado. In 2019, legislators passed

statutes updating, among other things, the state’s marijuana laws to allow for new sources of investment in the Colorado marijuana industry, including by publicly traded companies and created accompanying disclosure requirements.
 In Colorado, cannabis businesses must comply with local licensing requirements in addition to state licensing requirements in order to operate. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities or retail dispensary facilities.
 There are multiple license categories that cover all commercial activity. Categories include: (1) medical/retail cultivation, (2) medical/retail stores, (3) medical/retail manufacturers, (4) medical/retail transporters, (5) retail hospitality and sales, (6) medical/retail marijuana business operator and (6) medical/retail testing facilities. Categories of licenses are further broken down into subtypes. For example, there are multiple types of cultivation licenses available depending upon the size of the cultivation operation. Licensees may also apply for permits that allow for the conduct of additional business functions such as centralized distribution, delivery, and off-premises storage.
 Each facility is authorized to engage only in the type of activity for which it is licensed. Licenses are valid for one year from the date of issuance. Before expiration, licensees are required to submit a renewal application.
 To acquire a license, the individuals and entities who own or control the licensee must be vetted by the State to determine whether they are suitable under Colorado law to operate a license. Generally, any natural person or entity that holds a 10% interest or greater (directly or indirectly) in the licensee must be disclosed and vetted for suitability. All board members and corporate officers of the licensee must be disclosed and vetted, including board members and corporate officers of the entity-owners with 10% or greater interest. Additionally, those who exercise an inordinate amount of control over a licensee—whether through financing, IP agreements, management agreements, or some combination thereof, can also be considered “controlling beneficial owners” by the MED and subsequently be required to undergo vetting for suitability. Colorado licensing requirements largely do not respect anonymity in ownership regularly pierce corporate veils to determine the natural people who ultimately control a given license.
Local authorities also grant licenses to conduct marijuana businesses within their jurisdiction, and DOR licensing for a marijuana business is conditioned on approval from the local authorities. An applicant is prohibited from operating a marijuana business prior to obtaining all necessary licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals from both the State licensing authority and local licensing authorities.
 
Security Requirements
 Colorado law requires that all licensees have a security alarm system and must ensure that their premises are continuously monitored. Licenses must also use commercial-grade non-residential door locks at all points of ingress and egress. All licensed marijuana businesses are required to utilize video surveillance and camera recording systems, which at a minimum, must consist of digital or network video recorders, video monitors, digital archiving devices, and a color printer capable of delivering still photos. Such equipment must be stored in a secure area that is only accessible to the licensee’s management staff. In addition to other requirements, all video surveillance equipment must be equipped with a failure notification system that provides prompt notification to the licensee of any prolonged surveillance interruption and/or complete failure of the surveillance system.
Inspections
The MED and local licensing authorities may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Licensees may also be subject to inspection of the licensed premises by the local fire department, building inspector, or code enforcement officer to confirm that no health or safety concerns are present.
Colorado Reporting Requirements
 Colorado uses METRC as the MED’s marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. This tracking is conducted by using electronic tags on plants and shipments between licensees and facilities.
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in Colorado.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Connecticut
 The State of Connecticut has authorized cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Connecticut marijuana businesses. The Medical Marijuana Program, or MMP, registers qualifying patients, primary caregivers,

Dispensary Facilities, or DFs, and Dispensary Facility Employees, or DFEs. The MMP was established by Connecticut General Statutes §§ 21a-408–21a429. DFs and production facilities are separately licensed.
 The MMP is administered by the Department of Consumer Protection, or DCP. Patients with qualifying debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including patients with such conditions include but are not limited to cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Parkinson’s disease, or multiple sclerosis (MS). A physician or advanced practice registered nurse must issue a written certification for an MMP patient, and the qualifying patient or caregiver must choose one designated DF where the patient’s marijuana will be obtained.
In Connecticut, marijuana may not be produced or dispensed without the appropriate license. The DCP determines how many facility licenses to issue based on the size and location of the DFs in operation, the number of qualifying patients registered with the DCP, and the convenience and economic benefits to qualifying patients.
 When the DCP determines that additional licenses for DFs should be granted, it publishes a notice of open applications for DF licenses. This notice must include the maximum number of licenses to be granted, the deadline for receipt of applications, and the criteria that will be considered when awarding the licenses. Such criteria must include character and fitness of any person who may have control or influence over the operation of the proposed DF; the location for the proposed DF; the applicant’s ability to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, or loss of marijuana; the applicant’s ability to maintain the knowledge, understanding, judgment, procedures, security controls, and ethics to ensure optimal safety and accuracy in the dispensing and sale of marijuana; and the extent to which the applicant or any of the applicant’s DF backers have a financial interest in another licensee, registrant, or applicant.
 Applicants for DF licenses must identify, among other things, the proposed DF location, financial statements, criminal background check applications for the applicant and applicant’s backers, a plan to prevent theft and diversion, and a blueprint of the proposed DF. An application for a DF license also requires the payment of a $5,000 fee. If approved, the licensee must pay an additional $5,000 before receiving its license. The decision of the DCP’s Commissioner, or Commissioner, not to award a DF license to an applicant is final.
 
Connecticut Dispensary Facility Requirements
 A DF may not dispense marijuana from, obtain marijuana from, or transfer marijuana to a location outside of the state of Connecticut. DFs are limited to the following modes of obtaining, delivering, transferring, transporting, and selling marijuana:
 •A DF may acquire marijuana from a producer;
 •A DF may dispense and sell marijuana to a qualifying patient or primary caregiver registered to their facility and who is registered with the DCP;
 •A DF may dispense or sell to a research program subject pursuant to the protocols of a research program approved by the Commissioner;
 •A DF may transfer, distribute, deliver, transport, or sell to a research program employee pursuant to the protocols of a research program approved by the Commissioner;
 •A DF may transfer, distribute, deliver or transport to a hospice or other inpatient care facility licensed by the Department of Public Health that has a protocol for handling and distributing marijuana that has been approved by the DCP; and
 •A DF may transfer, distribute, deliver or transport marijuana to an approved laboratory.
 Only a pharmacist licensed as a dispensary may dispense marijuana, and only a dispensary or dispensary technician may sell marijuana to qualifying customers, primary caregivers, or research program subjects who are registered with the DCP. A DF may not engage in marijuana compounding, except that a dispensary may dilute a medical marijuana product with a USP grade substance with no active ingredient for the purposes of dose titration, tapering, for the addition of a flavoring agent, or creating a maintenance dose that is not available from any producer at the time of purchase. No person associated with a DF may enter into any agreement with a certifying health care provider or health care facility concerning the provision of services or equipment that may adversely affect any person’s freedom to choose the DF at which the qualifying customer or primary caregiver will purchase marijuana, except in the case of an approved research program. All DFEs must, at all times while at the DF, have their current dispensary license, dispensary technician registration, or DFE registration available for inspection by the Commissioner or the DCP. The DF shall establish, implement and adhere to a written alcohol-free, drug-free, and smoke-free workplace policy, which must be available to the DCP upon request. Marijuana may not be applied, ingested, or consumed inside a DF.
 Each DF must make publicly available the price of all its marijuana products to prospective qualifying patients and primary caregivers. As of February 18, 2022, the DCP increased the monthly allotments for qualifying patients from 3.0 ounces to 3.5 ounces. All marijuana must be sold in child-resistant, sealed containers except upon a written request from the qualifying patient or primary

caregiver. No marijuana may be sold without the producer label. All products sold to the qualifying patient or primary caregiver must be placed in an opaque package that shall not indicate the contents of the package, the originating facility, or in any other way cause another person to believe that the package may contain marijuana. Each DF must also provide information to qualifying patients and primary caregivers regarding the possession and use of marijuana. The DF manager must submit all informational material to the Commissioner for approval prior to such information being provided to qualifying patients and primary caregivers.
 
Connecticut Security and Storage Requirements
 All facilities must have an adequate security system to prevent and detect the loss of marijuana. These systems must use commercial grade equipment, including perimeter alarms, motion detectors, video cameras with 24-hour recordings (which must be retained for at least 30 days), silent alarms, panic alarms, a failure notification system, and the ability to remain operational during a power outage. Each facility must also have a backup alarm system approved by the Commissioner. The outside perimeter of every facility must be well-lit. All equipment must be kept in good working order and tested at least twice per year.
 A DF must:
•Not maintain marijuana in excess of the quantity required for normal, efficient operation;
 •Store all marijuana in an approved safe or approved vault and in such a manner as to prevent diversion, theft or loss;
 •Maintain all marijuana in a secure area or location accessible only to specifically authorized employees, which shall include only the minimum number of employees essential for efficient operation;
 •Keep all approved safes and approved vaults securely locked and protected from entry, except for the actual time required to remove or replace marijuana;
 •Keep all locks and security equipment in good working order;
 •Keep the dispensary department securely locked and protected from entry by unauthorized employees; and
 •Post a sign at all entry ways into any area of the DF containing marijuana stating, “Do Not Enter—Limited Access Area—Access Limited to Authorized Employees Only.” All deliveries must be carried out under the direct supervision of a pharmacist licensed as a dispensary, who must be present to accept the delivery. Upon delivery, the marijuana must immediately be placed in an approved safe or approved vault within the dispensary.
 No person may enter the area where marijuana is dispensed and sold unless such person is licensed or registered by the DCP; such person’s responsibilities necessitate access to the dispensary department and then for only as long as necessary to perform the person’s job duties; or such person has a patient or caregiver registration certificate, in which case such person must not be permitted behind the service counter or in other areas where marijuana is stored.
 
Connecticut Transportation Requirements
 Prior to transporting any marijuana or marijuana product, a DF must complete a shipping manifest using a form prescribed by the Commissioner and securely transmit a copy of the manifest to the laboratory, research program location, hospice, or other inpatient care facility that will receive the products and to the DCP at least 24 hours prior to transport. These manifests must be maintained and made available to the DCP. Marijuana may only be transported in a locked, secure storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana. This compartment may not be visible from outside the vehicle. Routes must be randomized.
 All transport vehicles must be staffed with a minimum of two employees. At least one delivery team member is required to remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains marijuana. A delivery team member must have access to a secure form of communication with employees at the originating facility at all times that the vehicle contains marijuana. A delivery team member must physically possess a department-issued identification card at all times when transporting or delivering marijuana and must produce it to the Commissioner or law enforcement official upon request.
 No marijuana may be sold, dispensed, or distributed via a delivery service or any other manner outside of a DF without the approval of DCP, except that a primary caregiver may deliver marijuana to the caregiver’s qualified patient and a DFE may deliver to a hospice or other inpatient care facility licensed by the Department of Public Health that has a protocol for handling and distributing marijuana that has been approved by the DCP. As of September 27, 2012, a DF may register with DCP to provide delivery of cannabis products and paraphernalia to qualifying patients and caregivers.


Inspections by the Commissioner
 All documents required to be kept by a facility must be maintained in an auditable format for no less than three years. These records must be provided to the Commissioner or an authorized delegate immediately upon request. Additionally, the Commissioner and authorized delegates may enter any place, including a vehicle, where marijuana is held, produced, or otherwise handled, and inspect in a reasonable manner such place and all pertinent items and documents within it.
 
Passage of Adult Legislation in Connecticut
 On June 22, 2021, Governor Ned Lamont signed into law Senate Bill 1201, which authorizes the legal possession of certain quantities of cannabis for adults over the age of 21 effective July 1, 2021, and creates a process for the regulation of adult-use cannabis cultivation, production, distribution, and sale to consumers over the age of 21 within the state. The Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) has issued operational policies and procedures and implemented the licensing framework for the cultivators, micro-cultivators, product manufacturers, food and beverage manufacturers, product packagers, retailers, hybrid retailers, transporters, and delivery services. The number of retail licenses permitted per town may not exceed one per 25,000 residents until June 30, 2024. Half of the licenses are to be granted to social equity applicants—defined as people who have lived in geographic areas disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs and who make no more than three times the state’s median income.
 The state’s existing medical marijuana dispensaries can convert to “hybrid retailers” serving both medical and adult-use consumers. In order to convert, applicants must have a Social Equity Council-approved workforce development plan and pay a fee of $1 million, or $500,000 if the dispensary has committed to creating at least one equity joint venture. Hybrid retailers must maintain a licensed pharmacist on premises at all times when the hybrid retail location is open to the public or to qualifying patients and caregivers. The hybrid retailer must also accommodate an expedited method of entry that allows for priority entrance into the premises for qualifying patients and caregivers. A dispensary facility may apply to the DCP to convert its license to a hybrid retail location at any time after February 3, 2022, without applying through the lottery process. The license conversion will require a DF to submit to, and obtain approval from the DCP for, a detailed medical marijuana preservation plan for how it will prioritize sales and access to medical marijuana products for qualifying patients, including, but not limited to, managing customer traffic flow, preventing supply shortages, providing delivery services and ensuring appropriate staffing safeguards. The DCP estimates that retail sales will likely not be available until at least the end of 2022.
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in Connecticut.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Florida
 In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act, or CUA, which was a low-THC (CBD) law, allowing cannabis containing not more than 0. 8% THC to be sold to patients diagnosed with severe seizures or muscle spasms and cancer. The CUA created a competitive licensing structure and initially allowed for one vertically integrated license to be awarded in each of five regions. The CUA set forth the criteria for applicants as well as the minimum qualifying criteria, which included the requirement to hold a nursery certificate evidencing the capacity to cultivate a minimum of 400,000 plants, to be operated by a nurseryman, and to be a registered nursery for at least 30 continuous years. The CUA also created a state registry to track dispensations. In 2016, the Florida Legislature passed the Right to Try Act, or RTA, which expanded the State’s medical cannabis program to allow for full potency THC products to be sold as “medical marijuana” to qualified patients.
 In November of 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization ballot initiative (referred to herein as the “Initiative”) to expand the medical cannabis program under the RTA was approved by 71.3% of voters, thereby amending the Florida constitution. The Initiative is now codified as Article X, Section 29 of the Florida Constitution. The Initiative expanded the list of qualifying medical conditions to include cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV and AIDS, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, PTSD, multiple sclerosis, and other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class or comparable to those other qualifying conditions and for which a physician believes the benefits outweigh the risks to the patient. The Initiative also provided for the implementation of State-issued medical cannabis identification cards. In 2017, the Florida Legislature passed legislation implementing the constitutional amendment and further codifying the changes outlined in the constitution into law. The 2017 law provides for the issuance of 10 licenses to specific entities and another four licenses to be issued for every 100,000 active qualified patients added to the registry. The 2017 law also initially limited license holders to a maximum of 25 dispensary locations with the ability to purchase additional dispensary locations from one another and for an additional five locations to be allowed by the State for every 100,000 active qualified patients added to the registry. The 2017 legislation’s cap on dispensing facilities expired in April 2020.
 Under Florida law, a licensee is required to cultivate, process, and dispense medical cannabis. Licenses are issued by the Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use, or OMMU, and may be renewed biennially. Trulieve US received its most recent license renewal on July 24, 2020, and is classified as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, or MMTC, under Florida law.


There is no state-imposed limitation on the permitted size of cultivation or processing facilities in Florida, nor is there a limit on the number of plants that may be grown. The is expected to issue anywhere from 18-22 new MMTC licenses, depending on the number of registered patients at the start of the application process, beginning in 2022 with the issuance of a single license to a recognized class member of Pigford v. Glickman, 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999) or In re Black Farmers Litigation, 856 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2011).
Under our license, we are permitted to sell cannabis to those customers who are entered into Florida’s electronic medical marijuana use registry by a qualified physician and possess a state-issued medical marijuana identification card and a valid certification from the qualified physician. The physician determines customer eligibility as well as the routes of administration (e.g., topical, oral, inhalation sublingual, suppository, edible, and smoking marijuana) and the number of milligrams per day a customer is able to obtain under the program. The physician may order a certification for up to three 70-day supply limits of marijuana, following which the certification expires, and a physician must issue a new certification. The number of milligrams dispensed, the category of cannabis (either low-THC or medical marijuana), and whether a delivery device, such as a vaporizer, has been dispensed is all recorded in the registry for each customer transaction. In addition, smokable flower was approved by the legislature and signed into law in March 2019. Customer must obtain a specific recommendation from their physician to purchase smokable flower. The maximum amount a customer may obtain is 2.5 ounces (measured by weight) of smokable flower per 35-day supply.
 We are authorized to sell a broad selection of products across various product categories. OMMU implemented rules regulating the production and sale of edible products in August of 2020, and the Company’s Florida licensee shortly thereafter became the first MMTC to dispense edibles in Florida. OMMU implemented rules regulating the use of hydrocarbon solvents (e.g., N-butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and heptane) for the extraction of derivative products in August 2021. Trulieve announced the first sale in Florida of hydrocarbon extraction-derived concentrate products in September 2021.
 Dispensaries may be located in any location zoned as appropriate for a pharmacy throughout the State of Florida as long as the local government has not expressly prohibited MMTC dispensaries in their respective municipality. Additionally, dispensaries must be located more than 500 feet from a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school. Following the adoption of the cap on total dispensaries by each MMTC, as discussed above, our Florida licensee filed a claim in the Court for the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County challenging the dispensary cap and asking the Court to disregard the dispensary locations we had open and/or applied for prior to the limitation becoming effective. On February 4, 2019, we announced that we won our lawsuit in the trial court, with the court ruling that we may open an additional 14 dispensary locations based on these locations having previously vested. Moreover, the Court ruled that in the alternative, the statutory caps placed on the number of dispensaries allowed across the State were not only unconstitutionally added after Amendment 2 had been approved by voters but were also adversely impacting customer access. We have since settled our challenge with the Florida Department of Health. Our 14 dispensaries that were established before the statewide cap was enacted are now excluded from the statutory cap. The statutory cap expired in April 2020; thus, neither Trulieve US nor its competitors in Florida are subject to restrictions on the number of dispensaries that may be opened. As of March 16, 2022, we had 113 approved dispensaries in the State of Florida. In addition, our license allows us to deliver products directly to customers.
 Florida Reporting Requirements
 Florida law called for the OMMU to establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the OMMU to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of certain events, including when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed, and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Each medical marijuana treatment center shall use the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU or integrate its own seed-to-sale tracking system with the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU. At this time, the OMMU has not implemented a statewide seed-to-sale tracking system; thus, we use our own seed-to-sale system. Additionally, the OMMU maintains a patient and physician registry, and licensees must comply with all requirements and regulations regarding the provision of required data or proof of key events to said system to retain their license. Florida requires all MMTCs to abide by representations made in their original application to the State of Florida or any subsequent variances to the same. The OMMU must approve any changes or expansions of previous representations and disclosures to the OMMU via an amendment or variance process.
Florida Licensing Requirements
Licenses issued by the OMMU may be renewed biennially so long as the licensee continues to meet the requirements of the Florida Statute 381.986 and pays a renewal fee. Individuals or entities who directly or indirectly own, control, or hold with power to vote five percent or more of the voting shares of a MMTC may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares or other form of ownership of any other MMTC. Applicants must demonstrate (and licensed MMTC’s must maintain) that: (i) they have been registered to do business in the State of Florida for the previous five years, (ii) they possess a valid certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, (iii) they have the technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce cannabis, including, but not limited to, low-THC cannabis, (iv) they have the ability to secure the premises, resources, and personnel necessary to operate as an MMTC, (v) they have the ability to maintain accountability of all raw materials, finished products,

and any by-products to prevent diversion or unlawful access to or possession of these substances, (vi) they have an infrastructure reasonably located to dispense cannabis to registered qualified patients statewide or regionally as determined by the OMMU, (vii) they have the financial ability to maintain operations for the duration of the two-year approval cycle, including the provision of certified financial statements to the OMMU, (viii) all owners, officers, board members and managers have passed a Level II background screening, inclusive of fingerprinting, (ix) they ensure that a medical director is employed to supervise the activities of the MMTC, and (x) they have a diversity plan and veterans plan accompanied by a contractual process for establishing business relationships with veterans and minority contractors and/or employees. Upon approval of the application by the OMMU, the applicant must post a performance bond of up to US $5 million, which may be reduced to US $2 million once the licensee has served 1,000 patients (which Trulieve has accomplished).
 There was a lawsuit that challenged essential aspects of the 2017 Legislation and OMMU regulations. In December 2017, Florigrown, LLC and other plaintiffs challenged aspects of the 2017 Legislation and OMMU regulations as unconstitutional due to: (1) requiring MMTCs to be vertically integrated (e.g., cultivate and process the cannabis to be sold at the MMTC’s own licensed dispensaries); (2) the cap of total number of MMTC licenses in the State; and (3) the authorization of the OMMU to issue MMTC licenses to certain applicants that met criteria defined by the 2017 legislation. On October 18, 2019, a trial judge in the Circuit Court for Leon County ruled that Florigrown, LLC had a substantial likelihood of succeeding on its claims, holding that the vertical integration and licensing cap conflicted with the language in Article X, Section 29 and that the provisions in 2017 defining the criteria for eligibility for MMTC licensure constituted an impermissible “special law” under Article III, Section 11(a)(12) of the Florida Constitution. On July 10, 2019, an intermediate appellate court affirmed aspects of the Circuit Court for Leon County’s ruling. On May 27, 2021, the Florida Supreme Court issued a 6-1 decision finding that Florigrown, LLC and the other plaintiffs did not demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of any of its constitutional claims. In effect, the Florida Supreme Court’s 6-1 decision upholds Florida’s regulatory scheme.
 
Security and Storage Requirements for Cultivation, Processing and Dispensing Facilities in Florida
 Adequate outdoor lighting is required from dusk to dawn for all MMTC facilities. 24-hour per day video surveillance is required, and all MMTCs must maintain at least a rolling 45-day period that is made available to law enforcement and the OMMU upon demand. Alarm systems must be active at all items for all entry points and windows. Interior spaces must also have motion detectors, and all cameras must have an unobstructed view of key areas. Panic alarms must also be available for employees to be able to signal authorities when needed.
 In dispensaries, the MMTC must provide a waiting area with a sufficient seating area. There must also be a minimum of one private consultation/education room for the privacy of the patient(s) and their caregiver (if applicable). The MMTC may only dispense products between 7:00 am and 9:00 pm. All active products must be kept in a secure location within the dispensary, and only empty packaging may be kept in the dispensary’s general area, which is readily accessible to customers and visitors. No product or delivery devices may be on display in the waiting area.
 An MMTC must at all times provide secure and logged access for all cannabis materials. This includes approved vaults or locked rooms. There must be at least two employees of the MMTC, or an approved security provider on-site at all times. All employees must wear proper identification badges, and visitors must be logged in and wear a visitor badge while on the premises. The MMTC must report to local law enforcement any loss, diversion, or theft of cannabis materials within 24 hours of becoming aware of such an occurrence.
 
Florida Transportation Requirements
 When transporting cannabis to dispensaries or customers for delivery, a manifest must be prepared, and transportation must be done using an approved vehicle. The cannabis must be stored in a separate, locked area of the vehicle, and at all times while in transit, there must be two people in a delivery vehicle. During deliveries, one person must remain with the vehicle. The delivery employees must at all times have identification badges. The manifest must include the following information: (i) departure date and time; (ii) name, address, and license number of the originating MMTC; (iii) name and address of the receiving entity; (iv) the quantity and form of cannabis and delivery device; (v) arrival date and time; (vi) the make, model and license plate of the delivery vehicle; and (vii) the name and signatures of the MMTC delivery employees. The MMTC must keep these manifests for inspection for up to three years. During the delivery, a copy of the manifest is also provided to the recipient.
 
OMMU Inspections in Florida
 The OMMU may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of MMTCs to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OMMU is to inspect an MMTC upon receiving a complaint or notice that the MMTC has dispensed cannabis containing mold, bacteria, or other contaminants that may cause an adverse effect to humans or the environment. The OMMU is to

conduct at least a biennial inspection of each MMTC to evaluate the MMTC’s records, personnel, equipment, security, sanitation practices, and quality assurance practices.

 Regulation of Cannabis in Georgia
 On April 17, 2019, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed into law the Hope Act, which creates a regulatory scheme to permit the production of low-THC oil, that is, oil with a THC content of no greater than 5%, for provision to patients for medical purposes. In specific, the Hope Act created a seven-member Georgia Access to Cannabis Commission (the “GA Commission”), charged with drafting regulations to implement the low-THC oil program. Under the Hope Act, the GA Commission is permitted to issue up to six production licenses – two Class 1 licenses allowing up to 100,000 square feet of cultivation canopy each and four Class 2 licenses allowing up to 50,000 square feet of cultivation canopy each – and is also required to issue licenses to the University of Georgia and Fort Valley State University, in the event that either University chooses to participate, for cultivation and research regarding low-THC oil. The Hope Act envisions that the Georgia Board of Pharmacy would develop and oversee licensing criteria by which pharmacies would be permitted to dispense low-THC oil; the GA Commission is also expected to issue rules to license free-standing dispensaries. On July 24, 2021, the GA Commission announced its intention to award the two Class 1 and four Class 2 production licenses, including the award of one Class 1 license to Trulieve GA Inc. The regulations for the licensure of dispensaries have not currently been promulgated, and so there are no currently licensed dispensaries in Georgia.
 Georgia law requires eligible patients to obtain physician approval to be added to the Low THC Oil Registry, which is administered by the Georgia Department of Public Health. Qualifying conditions include: (1) end-stage cancer-producing wasting illness or recalcitrant nausea and vomiting,(2) severe or end-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (3) seizure disorders, (4) multiple sclerosis, (5) Crohn’s disease, (6) mitochondrial disease, (7) severe or end-stage Parkinson’s disease, (8) severe or end-stage sickle cell disease, (9) severe Tourette’s syndrome, (10) autism spectrum disorder, (11) epidermolysis bullosa, (12) severe or end-stage Alzheimer’s diseases, (13) severe or end-stage AIDS, (14) severe or end-stage peripheral neuropathy, (15) inpatient or outpatient hospice treatment, (16) intractable pain, and (17) post-traumatic stress disorder. At present, Georgia law prohibits registered patients from ingesting low-THC oil through any manner that employs a heating element or similar means to produce vapors, including combustible products as well as vaporizers.
 The GA Commission is authorized to issue regulations for the oversight of the low-THC oil program. At present, the GA Commission has not promulgated such regulations. The Hope Act contemplates that the GA Commission will issue regulations in the following categories:
•to establish requirements related to quality control, security, and oversight of production. In particular, licensees will be required to establish security plans that include 24/7 monitoring and intrusion detection, recording and video storage systems, and licensed security personnel.
 •to establish requirements related to secured transportation of low-THC oil products and tracking of deliveries.
 •to prohibit pesticides in production, except for pesticides certified as organic by the Organic Materials Review Institute or a similar standards organization.
 •to establish requirements related to testing for purity and dosage levels, and to ensure that product labels accurately reflect product content.
 •to establish requirements for a track and trace system. In specific, the track and trace system will be operated by a GA Commission-approved vendor that licensees will be required to use. The system will need to be capable of tracking plants, products, and registered patient purchase totals, as well as waste, transfers, conversions, sales, and returns. It will also need to be able to track plants, low-THC oil, and products throughout the entire chain of custody, as well as monitor inventory and prevent theft, loss, and diversion. The track and trace system will provide real-time data to the GA Commission related to total low-THC oil daily sales, the total number of marijuana plants currently in production, and the number of plants destroyed or disposed of.
 •to require licensees to collect and report data.
 •to regulate marketing and signage related to low-THC oil, including prohibiting the direct advertisement of low-THC oil to registered patients or the public.
 •to prohibit cultivation, processing, and dispensing facilities within 3,000 feet of schools, early care and education programs, and places of worship.


The GA Commission is also authorized to enforce the various regulatory requirements noted above, such as through inspections and collaboration with law enforcement.
 Regulation of the Cannabis Market in Maryland
 
Maryland Regulatory Landscape
In 2012, a state law was enacted in Maryland to establish a state-regulated medical marijuana program. Legislation was signed in May 2013, and the program became operational on December 1, 2017. The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (the “MMCC”) regulates the state program and awarded operational licenses in a highly competitive application process. One hundred two dispensary licenses were awarded out of a pool of over 800 applicants, while an original 15 cultivation licenses were awarded out of a pool of nearly 150 applicants. In April 2018, Maryland lawmakers agreed to expand the state’s medical marijuana industry by authorizing an additional 20 licenses, seven for cultivation and 13 for processing. The state program allows access to medical marijuana for patients with chronic or debilitating diseases or medical conditions, including but not limited to: chronic pain, nausea, seizures, glaucoma, PTSD, and other conditions which are severe and for which other treatments have been ineffective.
 There are three principal medical cannabis license categories in Maryland: (1) grower, (2) processor, and (3) dispensary. We have control and/or ownership over one grower license, one processor license, and three dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Maryland. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Maryland.
 All grower, processor, and dispensary establishments must register with the MMCC under the provisions of the Maryland Medical Cannabis Law, Md. Code, Health-Gen § 13-3301 et seq., known as the Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a medical marijuana license.
 Licenses are valid for a period of six years of initial licensure, and annual license fees must be paid to maintain licensure. After the expiration of the initial six-year licensure period, the licensee is required to renew the license every four years thereafter. Licensees are required to submit a renewal application per the guidelines published by the MMCC. Ninety days prior to the expiration of a license, the MMCC notifies the licensee of the date on which the license expires and provides the instructions and fee required to renew the license along with the consequences of failure to renew. At least 30 calendar days before a license expires, the licensee must submit the renewal application as provided by the MMCC. The annual licensing fee for a grower is $125,000, $40,000 for a processor, and $40,000 for a dispensary.
 The medical grower license permits us to cultivate, manufacture, package, and distribute medical cannabis to licensed processors, licensed dispensaries, or registered independent testing laboratories. The medical processor license permits us to transform the medical cannabis into another product or extract and package and label medical cannabis. The dispensary licenses permit us to acquire, possess, repackage, process, transfer, transport, sell, distribute, or dispense products containing medical cannabis, related supplies, related products including tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments, or educational materials for use by a qualifying patient or caregiver.
 
Dispensing Requirements
 In order to dispense medical cannabis, a licensed dispensary is required to comply with various dispensing requirements: (1) require presentment of a written certification from a qualifying patient or caregiver, (2) query the MMCC’s data network to verify that the patient is currently registered and has a certification from a provider, as well as the amount of medical cannabis that has already been dispensed pursuant to the written certification,(3) dispense no more than a 30-day supply, and (4) decline to dispense medical cannabis if the patient or caregiver appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Registered patients and caregivers are required to provide attestations relating to their knowledge of the status of medical cannabis under Maryland and Federal law, as well as limitations on the use of medical cannabis, such as keeping away from children and refraining from transfer to any other person.
Requirements Relating to Recordkeeping and Inventory Control
 Licensed growers are required to use a perpetual inventory system that identifies and tracks each lot of medical cannabis from the time of propagation to the time it is delivered to a licensed dispensary and dispensed to a qualified patient. The perpetual inventory system is required to be capable of tracking cannabis back to its original source and to promptly identify discrepancies. Each plant within the perpetual inventory system is required to be assigned a unique identifier that is traceable through the entire production and dispensing lifecycle. Licensees are required to investigate discrepancies identified by the perpetual inventory system and to report such discrepancies to the MMCC and Maryland State Police where the licensee finds evidence of theft or diversion.
 Licensed growers, processors, and dispensaries are required to retain, independent of the required inventory control system, a searchable, secure, tamper-evident record of distribution regarding the names and addresses of recipients, the quantity provided, and the

name, strength, batch number and lot number of the product provided. Such records must be available to certifying providers upon request. Licensees are also required to retain records of production and distribution of each batch and lot and of daily checklists to maintain uniformity from batch to batch, as well as a log of all visitors to licensed premises. Records must be kept in duplicate at a secure off-site location.
 Requirements Relating to Security
 Licensees are required to take measures to ensure the safety and security of licensed premises such as: (1) constructing the premises so as to prevent unauthorized entry, (2) constructing secure rooms for the storage of cannabis that are not along the exterior wall of a facility and that have access-controlled entry, (3) utilizing exterior lighting fixtures to ensure proper surveillance, (4) installing security alarms covering perimeter entry points, which shall be continuously monitored, (5) installing separate alarm systems to protect on-site and off-site record storage areas, as well as areas used for cannabis storage, and (6) utilizing motion-activated video surveillance that covers entrances and exits to a facility, as well as any area that cannabis is packaged, tested, processed, stored, or dispensed.
Maryland Reporting Requirements
 The State of Maryland uses METRC as the state’s computerized seed-to-sale tracking system. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use a third-party application for our computerized seed to sale software, which integrates with the state’s METRC program and captures the required data points for growing, processing and, dispensing as required in the Maryland Medical Cannabis law.
 MMCC Inspections
Licensees are required to submit to announced and unannounced inspections by the MMCC, including but not limited to inspections based upon an allegation of noncompliance.
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in Maryland.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Massachusetts
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has authorized the cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Massachusetts marijuana businesses. The Medical Use of Marijuana Program, or MUMP, registers qualifying patients, personal caregivers, Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, or MTCs, and MTC agents. MTCs were formerly known as Registered Marijuana Dispensaries or RMDs. The MUMP was established by Chapter 369 of the Acts of 2012, “An Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana,” following the passage of the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Initiative, Ballot Question 3, in the 2012 general election. Additional statutory requirements governing the MUMP were enacted by the Legislature in 2017 and codified at G.L. c. 94I, et. seq. (referred to herein as the “Massachusetts Medical Act”). MTC Licenses are vertically integrated licenses in that each MTC license holder must cultivate, process, and dispense medical marijuana. Under a single MTC License, a licensee may not operate more than two locations in Massachusetts at which medical marijuana is cultivated, marijuana-infused products are manufactured, and marijuana is dispensed. No Person or Entity Having Direct or Indirect Control shall be granted, or hold more than three MTC Licenses.
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, or CCC, regulations, 935 CMR 501.000 et seq. (referred to herein as the “Massachusetts Medical Regulations”), provide a regulatory framework that requires MTCs to cultivate, process, transport, and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. Patients with debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), hepatitis C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) when such diseases are debilitating, and other debilitating conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patient’s healthcare provider.
 The CCC assumed control of the MUMP from the Department of Public Health on December 23, 2018. The CCC approved revised regulations for the MUMP on November 30, 2020, and the revised regulations became effective on January 8, 2021.
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Medical)
 The Massachusetts Medical Regulations delineate the licensing requirements for MTCs in Massachusetts. Licensed entities must demonstrate the following: (i) they are licensed and in good standing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; (ii) no person or entity has “Direct or Indirect Control” over more than three MTC licenses; (iii) under a single MTC License, a licensee may not operate more than two locations in Massachusetts at which medical marijuana is cultivated, marijuana infused products are manufactured, and marijuana is dispensed; (iv) MTC agents must be registered with the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission; (v) an MTC must have a program to provide reduced cost or free marijuana to patients with documented verifiable financial hardships;

(vi) one executive of an MTC must register with the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice Information Services on behalf of the entity as an organization user of the Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) system; (vii) the MTC applicant has initial capital resources of at least $500,000 in its control as evidenced by bank statements, lines of credit or equivalent; and (viii) payment of the required application fee.
 In an MTC application, an applicant must also demonstrate or include: (i) disclosure of each Person or Entity Having Direct or Indirect Control over the MTC’s operations; (ii) a plan to obtain liability insurance coverage; (iii) detailed summary of the business plan and proposed timeline for the MTC; (iv) an operational plan for the cultivation of marijuana and manufacturing of marijuana products, including a detailed summary of policies and procedures; and (v) a detailed summary of the operating policies and procedures for the MTC including security, prevention of diversion, storage of marijuana, transportation of marijuana, inventory procedures, procedures for quality control and testing of the product for potential contaminants, personnel policies, dispensing procedures, record-keeping procedures, plans for agent qualifications and training, and any plans for patient or personal caregiver home delivery. An MTC applicant must also: (i) disclose marijuana business interests in Massachusetts and other jurisdictions; (ii) provide documentation of a property interest in the proposed address; (iii) provide documentation that the applicant has held a community outreach meeting and entered in a Host Community Agreement with the host municipality; (iv) describe compliance with local codes, ordinances, and bylaws; (v) provide a diversity plan and a plan to positively impact “Areas of Disproportionate Impact”; and (vi) disclosure of relevant criminal, civil and administrative background matters. Finally, an MTC applicant must specify a cultivation tier for their license, which establishes the minimum and maximum square footage of canopy for their cultivation operation.
 After receipt of a Provisional MTC license, the CCC shall review architectural plans for the building of the MTC’s facilities, and once approved, the MTC provisional license holder shall construct its facilities in conformance with the requirements of the Massachusetts Regulations. Once the CCC completes its inspections of the facilities, the CCC shall issue a Final MTC License to the MTC applicant. A licensee may not begin cultivating marijuana until it has been issued a Final MTC License by the CCC.
 MTC Licenses in Massachusetts are renewed annually. Licensees are required to submit a renewal application at least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the license. While renewals are granted annually, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, we would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
 Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Medical)
 An MTC shall follow its written and approved operating procedures in the operation of its dispensary locations. Operating procedures shall include (i) security measures in compliance with the Massachusetts Medical Regulations; (ii) employee security policies including personal safety and crime prevention techniques; (iii) hours of operation and after-hours contact information; (iv) a price list for marijuana products; (v) storage and waste disposal protocols in compliance with state law; (vi) a description of the various strains of marijuana that will be cultivated and dispensed, and the forms that will be dispensed; (vii) procedures to ensure accurate recordkeeping including inventory protocols; (viii) plans for quality control; (ix) a staffing plan and staffing records; (x) diversion identification and reporting protocols; (xi) policies and procedures for the handling of cash on MTC premises including storage, collection frequency and transport to financial institutions; (xii) emergency procedures and procedures to promote workplace safety; (xiii) alcohol, smoke and drug free workplace policies; (xiv) plan for maintaining confidential information and records; (xv) procedures for determining prices and provision of free or reduced costs marijuana and marijuana products to patients with verified financial hardships; (xvi) policies and procedures for energy efficiency and conversation; and (xvii) procedures for patient education activities. The siting of dispensary locations is expressly subject to local/municipal approvals pursuant to state law, and municipalities may impose local permitting and licensing requirements that an MTC must comply with. More specifically, an MTC must comply with all local requirements regarding siting. The Massachusetts Medical Regulations require an MTC’s entrance to be no closer than 500 feet from the nearest school entrance, but this buffer zone distance may be reduced by a local municipality’s ordinance or bylaw. The Massachusetts Medical Regulations require that MTCs limit their inventory of seeds, plants, and usable marijuana to reflect the projected needs of registered qualifying patients. An MTC may only dispense to a registered qualifying patient or caregiver who has a currently valid certification.
Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Medical)
 An MTC must implement sufficient security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana at the MTC. These measures must include: (i) allowing only registered qualifying patients, caregivers, dispensary agents, authorized persons, or approved outside contractors access to the MTC facility; (ii) preventing individuals from remaining on the premises of an MTC if they are not engaging in activities that are permitted; (iii) disposing of marijuana or by-products in compliance with the law; (iv) establishing limited access areas accessible only to authorized personnel; (v) storing finished marijuana in a secure locked safe or vault; (vi) keeping equipment, safes, vaults or secured areas securely locked; (vii) ensuring that the outside perimeter of the MTC is sufficiently lit to facilitate surveillance; and (viii) ensuring that landscaping or foliage outside of the MTC does not allow a person to conceal themselves. An MTC shall also utilize a security/alarm system that: (i) monitors entry and exit points and

perimeter windows, (ii) includes a panic, duress, or holdup alarm, (iii) includes system failure notifications, (iv) includes 24-hour video surveillance of safes, vaults, sales areas, areas where marijuana is cultivated, processed or dispensed, and (v) includes date and time stamping of all recordings and the ability to produce a clear, color still photo. The security system shall have the capacity to remain operational during a power outage. The MTC must also maintain a backup alarm system with the capabilities of the primary system, and both systems are to be maintained in good working order and are to be inspected and tested at regular intervals.
 Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Medical)
 Marijuana and marijuana-infused products, or MIPs, may be transported between licensed MTCs by MTC agents or agents of a licensed Marijuana Transporter on behalf of an MTC. MTCs or licensed Marijuana Couriers may, with CCC approval, transport marijuana or MIPS directly to registered qualifying customers and Caregivers as part of a home delivery program. An MTC shall staff transport vehicles with a minimum of two MTC agents. At least one agent shall remain with the vehicle when the vehicle contains marijuana or MIPs. Prior to leaving the origination location, an MTC must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, the marijuana to be transported.
 Marijuana products must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper-proof or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. In the case of an emergency stop, a log must be maintained describing the reason for the stop, the duration, the location, and any activities of personnel exiting the vehicle. An MTC shall ensure that transportation times and routes are randomized. Each MTC agent shall carry his or her CCC-issued Agent Registration Card when transporting marijuana or MIPs and shall produce it to CCC representatives or law enforcement officials upon request. Where videotaping is required when weighing, inventorying, and accounting of marijuana before transportation or after receipt, the video must show each product being weighed, the weight, and the manifest. An MTC must document and report any unusual discrepancy in weight or inventory to the CCC and local law enforcement within 24 hours.
 An MTC shall report to the CCC and local law enforcement any vehicle accidents, diversions, losses, or other reportable incidents that occur during transport within 24 hours. An MTC shall retain transportation manifests for no less than one year and make them available to the CCC upon request. Vehicles used in transportation must be owned or leased, be properly registered, and contain a GPS system that is monitored during transport of marijuana and said vehicle must be inspected and approved by the CCC prior to use.
 During transit, an MTC must ensure that: (i) marijuana or MIPs are transported in a secure, locked storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana or MIPs; (ii) the storage compartment cannot be easily removed (for example, bolts, fittings, straps or other types of fasteners may not be easily accessible and not capable of being manipulated with commonly available tools); (iii) marijuana or MIPs are not visible from outside the vehicle; (iv) product is transported in a vehicle that bears no markings indicating that the vehicle is being used to transport marijuana or MIPs. Each MTC agent transporting marijuana or MIPs shall have access to a secure form of communication with personnel at the origination location when the vehicle contains marijuana or MIPs.
 CCC Inspections (Medical)
 The CCC or its agents may inspect an MTC and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice. An MTC shall immediately, upon request, make available to the CCC information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, and the CCC may direct an MTC to test marijuana for contaminants. Any violations found may be noted in a deficiency statement that will be provided to the MTC, and the MTC shall thereafter submit a Plan of Correction to the CCC outlining with particularity each deficiency and the timetable and steps to remediate the same. The CCC shall have the authority to suspend or revoke an MTC License in accordance with the applicable regulations.
 Regulation of the Adult-Use Cannabis Market in Massachusetts
 Adult-use (recreational) marijuana has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The CCC licenses various types of adult-use marijuana businesses, including cultivators, product manufacturers, and retailers (referred to herein collectively as “Marijuana Establishments”) pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use marijuana facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018. The CCC approved revised regulations for the adult-use program effective November 1, 2019, and January 8, 2021.
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use)
 Many of the same application requirements exist for an adult-use Marijuana Establishment license application as to those for a medical MTC application, and each person having “Direct or Indirect Control” must undergo background checks and fingerprinting with the CCC. Applicants must submit the location and identification of each site and must establish a property interest in the same, and the applicant and the local municipality must have entered into a host community agreement authorizing the location of the adult-use Marijuana Establishment within the municipality and a host community agreement certification form must be included in the application. Applicants must include disclosure of any regulatory actions against it by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the civil, criminal, and administrative history of the applicant and all persons and entities having “Direct or Indirect Control.” The application

must include, amongst other information, the proposed timeline for achieving operations, liability insurance, business plan, and a detailed summary describing the Marijuana Establishment’s proposed operating policies, including security, prevention of diversion, storage, transportation, inventory procedures, quality control, dispensing procedures, personnel policies, record keeping, maintenance of financial records, diversity plans, and employee training protocols.
 Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Adult-Use)
 Marijuana retailers are subject to certain operational requirements in addition to those imposed on Marijuana Establishments generally. Dispensaries must immediately inspect consumers’ identification to ensure that everyone who enters is at least 21 years of age. Dispensaries may not sell more than one ounce of marijuana or five grams of marijuana concentrate per transaction. Point-of-sale systems must be approved by the CCC, and retailers must record sales data. Records must be retained and available for auditing by the CCC and Department of Revenue. Retailers are required to conduct monthly analyses of equipment and sales data to determine that such systems have not been altered or interfered with to manipulate sales data, and to report any such discrepancies to the CCC.
 Dispensaries must also make educational materials available to consumers in commonly spoken languages designated by the CCC, with analogous materials for visually- and hearing-impaired persons. Such materials must include:
 •A warning that marijuana has not been analyzed or approved by the FDA, that there is limited information on side effects, that there may be health risks associated with using marijuana, and that it should be kept away from children;
 •A warning that when under the influence of marijuana, driving is prohibited, and machinery should not be operated;
 •Information to assist in the selection of marijuana, describing the potential differing effects of various strains of marijuana, as well as various forms and routes of administration;
 •Materials offered to consumers to enable them to track the strains used and their associated effects;
 •Information describing proper dosage and titration for different routes of administration, with an emphasis on using the smallest amount possible to achieve the desired effect and the impact of potency;
 •A discussion of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal;
 •Facts regarding substance use disorder signs and symptoms, as well as referral information for substance use disorder treatment programs;
 •A statement that consumers may not sell marijuana to any other individual;
 •Information regarding penalties for possession or distribution of marijuana in violation of Massachusetts law; and
 •Any other information required by the CCC.
 
Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Adult-Use)
 Each Marijuana Establishment must implement sufficient security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana at the establishment. Security measures taken by the establishments to protect the premises, employees, consumers, and the general public shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
 •Positively identifying and limiting access to individuals 21 years of age or older who are seeking access to the Marijuana
 •Establishment or to whom marijuana products are being transported;
 •Adopting procedures to prevent loitering and ensure that only individuals engaging in activity expressly or by necessary implication permitted by state law are allowed to remain on the premises;
 •Proper disposal of marijuana in accordance with applicable regulations;
 •Securing all entrances to the Marijuana Establishment to prevent unauthorized access;
 •Establishing limited access areas which shall be accessible only to specifically authorized personnel limited to include only the minimum number of employees essential for efficient operation;
 •Storing all finished marijuana products in a secure, locked safe or vault in such a manner as to prevent diversion, theft, or loss;
 •Keeping all safes, vaults, and any other equipment or areas used for the production, cultivation, harvesting, processing or storage, including prior to disposal, of marijuana or marijuana products securely locked and protected from entry, except for the actual time required to remove or replace marijuana;


•Keeping all locks and security equipment in good working order;
 •Prohibiting keys, if any, from being left in the locks or stored or placed in a location accessible to persons other than specifically authorized personnel;
 •Prohibiting accessibility of security measures, such as combination numbers, passwords, or electronic or biometric security systems, to persons other than specifically authorized personnel;
 •Ensuring that the outside perimeter of the marijuana establishment is sufficiently lit to facilitate surveillance, where applicable;
 •Ensuring that all marijuana products are kept out of plain sight and are not visible from a public place, outside of the marijuana establishment, without the use of binoculars, optical aids, or aircraft;
 •Developing emergency policies and procedures for securing all product following any instance of diversion, theft, or loss of marijuana, and conduct an assessment to determine whether additional safeguards are necessary;
 •Establishing procedures for safe cash handling and cash transportation to financial institutions to prevent theft, loss, and associated risks to the safety of employees, customers, and the general public;
 •Sharing the Marijuana Establishment’s floor plan or layout of the facility with law enforcement authorities, and in a manner and scope as required by the municipality and identifying when the use of flammable or combustible solvents, chemicals, or other materials are in use at the Marijuana Establishment; 
 •Sharing the Marijuana Establishment’s security plan and procedures with law enforcement authorities, including police and fire services departments, in the municipality where the Marijuana Establishment is located and periodically updating law enforcement authorities, police and fire services departments, if the plans or procedures are modified in a material way; and
 •Marijuana must be stored in special limited access areas, and alarm systems must meet certain technical requirements, including the ability to record footage to be retained for at least 90 days.
 
Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Adult-Use)
Marijuana products may only be transported between licensed Marijuana Establishments by registered Marijuana Establishment agents. A licensed marijuana transporter may contract with a Marijuana Establishment to transport that licensee’s marijuana products to other licensed establishments. All transported marijuana products are linked to the seed-to-sale tracking program. Any marijuana product that is undeliverable or is refused by the destination Marijuana Establishment shall be transported back to the originating establishment. All vehicles transporting marijuana products shall be staffed with a minimum of two Marijuana Establishment agents. At least one agent shall remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains marijuana or marijuana products. Prior to the products leaving a Marijuana Establishment, the originating Marijuana Establishment must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products to be transported. Within eight hours after arrival at the receiving Marijuana Establishment, the receiving establishment must re-weigh, re-inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana products transported. Marijuana products must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. In the case of an emergency stop during the transportation of marijuana products, a log must be maintained describing the reason for the stop, the duration, the location, and any activities of personnel exiting the vehicle. A Marijuana Establishment or a marijuana transporter transporting marijuana products is required to ensure that all transportation times and routes are randomized and remain within Massachusetts.
 Vehicles must additionally be equipped with a video system that includes one or more cameras in the storage area of the vehicle and one or more cameras in the driver area of the vehicle. The video cameras must remain operational at all times during the transportation process and have the ability to produce a clear color still photo, whether live or recorded, with a date and time stamp embedded, and that does not significantly obscure the picture.
 Vehicles used for transport must be owned or leased by the Marijuana Establishment or transporter, and they must be properly registered, inspected, and insured in Massachusetts. Marijuana may not be visible from outside the vehicle, and it must be transported in a secure, locked storage compartment. Each vehicle must have a global positioning system, and any agent transporting marijuana must have access to a secure form of communication with the originating location.
 CCC Inspections
 The CCC or its agents may inspect a Marijuana Establishment and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice in order to determine compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All areas of a Marijuana Establishment, all Marijuana Establishment agents and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. During an inspection, the CCC may direct a marijuana establishment to test marijuana for contaminants as specified by the CCC, including but not limited to mold, mildew, heavy metals, plant-growth

regulators, and the presence of pesticides not approved for use on marijuana by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources. Moreover, the CCC is authorized to conduct a secret shopper program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
 Regulatory Changes for Medical and Adult Use Marijuana in Massachusetts
 The CCC voted to adopt significant amendments of both the medical and adult-use cannabis regulations at its meeting on November 30, 2020. The new regulations became effective on January 8, 2021. Significant changes included:
 •permitting Marijuana “Courier” Licensees to deliver directly to consumers from the premises of licensed marijuana retailer establishments and Marijuana Delivery Operators to purchase wholesale marijuana products directly from marijuana cultivation and product manufacturer establishments and deliver the products directly to consumers from the Delivery Operator’s warehouse location. Both Marijuana Courier and Marijuana Delivery Operator Licensees are reserved for at least 36 months from the date the first Delivery Operator Licensee receives a notice to commence operations from the CCC for companies majority-owned and controlled by certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants or Social Equity Program Participant Applicants, for which Trulieve does not qualify;
 • permitting Personal Caregivers to be registered to care for more than one – and up to five – Registered Qualifying Patients at one time; and
 • permitting non-Massachusetts residents receiving end-of-life or palliative care or cancer treatment in Massachusetts to become Registered Qualifying Patients.
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in Massachusetts.
 
Regulation of the Cannabis Market in Nevada
 Nevada became a medical marijuana state in 2001. In 2013, the Nevada legislature passed SB374, providing for state licensing of medical marijuana establishments. On November 8, 2016, Nevada voters passed the Nevada Marijuana Legalization Initiative, also known as Question 2, allowing for the sale of marijuana for adult use starting on July 1, 2017. In 2018, the Nevada Department of Taxation (the “DOT”) opened up applications for additional adult-use marijuana dispensary licenses. In December 2018, 61 additional marijuana dispensary licenses were issued by the DOT. Effective July 1, 2020, the Cannabis Compliance Board obtained regulatory oversight authority from the DOT.
 Nevada Licenses and Regulations
 There are four principal license categories in Nevada: (1) cultivation, (2) processing, (3) testing laboratory, and (4) sales facility. GreenMart is licensed to operate a medical and adult-use cultivation facility. These licenses are active within the State of Nevada. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at GreenMart’s facility in Nevada.
 Under applicable laws, the licenses permit GreenMart to cultivate, process, package, and sell marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Cannabis Compliance Board under the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes Title 56. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a medical and/or adult-use cannabis establishment license. In a local governmental jurisdiction that issues business licenses, the issuance by the Cannabis Compliance Board of a medical or adult-use cannabis establishment license is considered provisional until the local government has issued a business license for operation and an establishment is in compliance with all applicable local governmental ordinances. Licenses are valid for a period of one year, and the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board shall issue a renewal license within ten days after the receipt of a renewal application and applicable fee if the license is not then under suspension or has not been revoked.
 The cultivation license permits GreenMart to cultivate, process, test, package, and sell marijuana to retail marijuana stores, marijuana product manufacturing facilities, and other cultivation facilities.
 The processing license permits GreenMart to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply or sell edible marijuana products or marijuana-infused products to other marijuana production facilities or marijuana sales facilities. A distributor licensee must transport adult-use marijuana to sales facilities.
 In connection with our management of GreenMart, we were issued a Temporary Marijuana Support Business License by the Department of Business License in Clark County, Nevada, on August 4, 2020.
Security Requirements
 Licensees are required to ensure that licensed premises are enclosed and locked and that access is limited to officers, board members, and authorized agents. All other visitors must be escorted by an authorized agent. Cultivation facilities may not be visible

from a public place by normal, unaided vision. Licensees are required to maintain security equipment to detect and deter unauthorized intrusion: (1) intrusion detection devices covering the entirety of the cultivation area and the perimeter and exterior of the facility, (2) exterior lighting sufficient to permit surveillance, (3) video cameras covering the entirety of the cultivation area and the perimeter and exterior of the facility, (4) immediate automatic notification to local law enforcement in the event of a breach of security. All malfunctions of security equipment must be logged and reported to local law enforcement and regulators.
 Recordkeeping and Inventory Requirements
 Licensees are required to maintain an inventory control system that tracks cannabis plants from seed to sale. The system must track key inventory figures on an ongoing basis: (1) each day’s beginning inventory, acquisitions, harvests, sales, disbursements, and disposal, (2) acquisitions from other cannabis establishments, (3) batches of cannabis cultivated, and (4) manufactured cannabis products and materials throughout the manufacturing process. The inventory control system must adequately document plant materials from seed to sale and reconcile raw materials and finished products on a per-job basis. The system must also provide for quarterly physical inventory counts.
Nevada Reporting Requirements
 The State of Nevada uses METRC (Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Reporting & Compliance) as the State’s computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale. Effective November 1, 2017, all medical and adult-use marijuana establishments in Nevada must report their establishment data to the state of Nevada via METRC. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the State to meet all reporting requirements. Upon completion of its acquisition of GreenMart, we plan to use an in-house computerized seed-to-sale software that will integrate with METRC via API (GreenBits), which captures the required data points for cultivation and manufacturing as required in Nevada Revised Statutes section 678B. Nevada also requires licensees to submit quarterly physical inventory counts and monthly reports every quarter.
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in Nevada.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in Pennsylvania
 The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016, under Act 16, otherwise known as the Medical Marijuana Act, and provided access to state residents with one or more qualifying conditions. Pennsylvania has promulgated regulations to implement Act 16, which are primarily found in Chapters1131 through 1210 of Title 28 of the Pennsylvania Code.
 Under Act 16, medical marijuana refers to marijuana obtained for certified medical use by a Pennsylvania resident with at least 1 of 23 qualifying medical conditions as set by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (“DOH”). Act 16 initially authorized 17 qualifying conditions; However, through regulatory approval, that list has expanded and now also includes any terminal illness, dyskinetic and spastic movement disorders, and opioid use disorder.
 Under Act 16 and the DOH’s implementing regulations, patients who are residents of Pennsylvania and have a qualifying serious medical condition as certified by a physician are able to obtain medical marijuana at approved dispensaries within the Pennsylvania. A registered caregiver of an approved patient may also obtain medical marijuana from an approved dispensary. As of March 30, 2022, Pennsylvania does not permit home delivery of medical marijuana other than through a registered caregiver.
 On June 30, 2021, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law H.B. 1024 (also known as Act 44), which made revisions to Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program, including codification of certain practices permitted under emergency orders issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes permit a wider range of individuals to serve as caregivers, including employees of long-term care and nursing facilities. The changes also permit dispensaries some additional operational flexibilities, including providing limited, on-site outdoor order pickups, providing remote patient consultations, and providing medical dosages up to a 90 days' supply as opposed to a 30 days' supply.
 
Pennsylvania Permits and Regulations
 Act 16 authorized two principal categories of permits for medical marijuana organizations (“MMO”): (1) a grower/ processor permit and (2) a dispensary permit. Act 16 authorized the DOH to issue up to 25 grower/processor permits and up to 50 dispensary permits. A dispensary permit holder may have up to three dispensary locations within the primary region in which the primary facility is located. Pennsylvania is divided into six regions, with permits being awarded based on the patient population.
Pennsylvania also allows for a clinical registrant permit, which allows clinical registrant permit holders to operate both a grower/processor operation and multiple dispensary locations. Additionally, clinical registrants must partner with an approved medical research institution within Pennsylvania to conduct marijuana-based clinical research programs. All permit holders are required to use

the DOH-approved seed-to-sale tracking software for all inventory management and tracking. Pennsylvania currently utilizes the MJFreeway platform.
 All grower/processor and dispensary facilities must register with the DOH. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to continuing reporting and annual renewal requirements. A grower/processor permit allows a permit holder to acquire wholesale from another grower/processor, possess, cultivate, and manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply, or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. A grower/processor may transport products itself or may contract with an approved transporter. A grower/processor is not limited to distributing in the region in which it is located and may distribute medical marijuana products to any approved dispensary facility within the Commonwealth.
 Approved dispensaries may only purchase approved medical marijuana products from a permitted grower/processor and may only dispense to certified patients or caregivers who present valid identification cards. Prior to dispensing medical marijuana products to a patient or caregiver, the dispensary shall: (1) verify the validity of the patient or caregiver identification card using the electronic tracking system; and (2) review the information on the patient’s most recent certification by using the electronic tracking system to access the DOH’s database. The following requirements apply: (i) if a practitioner sets forth recommendations, requirements or limitations as to the form and/or dosage of a medical marijuana product on the patient certification, the medical marijuana product dispensed to a patient or caregiver by a dispensary must conform to those recommendations, requirements or limitations; (ii) if a practitioner does not set forth recommendations, requirements or limitations as to the form or dosage of a medical marijuana product on the patient certification, the physician, pharmacist, physician assistant or certified registered nurse practitioner employed by the dispensary and working at the facility shall consult with the patient or the caregiver regarding the appropriate form and dosage of the medical marijuana product to be dispensed; and (iii) the dispensary shall update the patient certification in the electronic tracking system by entering any recommendation as to the form or dosage of medical marijuana product that is dispensed to the patient.
 On March 5, 2021, the DOH proposed permanent regulations relating to medical marijuana, replacing the temporary regulations that have governed the program throughout its history. These proposed regulations are in substantially the same form as the temporary regulations, with only a few distinctions, including: (1) an MMO’s change in ownership without the DOH’s knowledge and written approval of all individuals affiliated with the MMO would be a violation of the act and proposed rules; (2) dispensaries and grower/processors must supplement ongoing reports to the DOH with information related to the average price per unit of medical marijuana products sold, as opposed to the per-dose price; (3) the list of reasons for which the DOH may suspend or revoke an MMO’s permit is augmented by adding falsification of information on any applications submitted to the DOH; and (4) principals, as well as employees, who have direct contact with patients or caregivers or who physically handle medical marijuana plants, seeds and products must also complete training. It is anticipated that the regulations will be finalized in 2022.
 Pennsylvania Permit Categories/Types
 Trulieve has various interests in entities with permits for retail operations and grower/processor operations in Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania Department of Health Inspections
 The Pennsylvania Department of Health may conduct announced or unannounced inspections or investigations to determine the MMO’s compliance with its permit. An investigation or inspection may include an inspection of an MMO’s site, facility, vehicles, books, records, papers, documents, data, and other physical or electronic information.
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses associated with our operations in Pennsylvania.
 Regulation of the Medical Cannabis Market in West Virginia
On April 19, 2017, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice signed into law Senate Bill 386, which created a medical cannabis program for West Virginia residents with serious medical conditions, and permits medical cannabis to be cultivated, processed, and dispensed to registered patients in essentially non-combustible forms. The program is administered by the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Office of Medical Cannabis. The Office has authority to (1) issue and oversee permits that authorize businesses to grow, process, or dispense medical cannabis in compliance with state law and regulations, (2) register medical practitioners who certify patients as having qualifying serious medical conditions, and (3) register and oversee patients with qualifying conditions.
 The statute establishes a list of qualifying conditions, including (1) cancer, (2) positive status for HIV/AIDS, (3) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (4) Parkinson’s disease, (5) multiple sclerosis, (6) spinal cord injury, (7) epilepsy, (8) neuropathy, (9) Huntington’s disease, (10) Crohn’s disease, (11) post-traumatic stress disorder, (12) intractable seizures, (13) sickle cell anemia, (14) severe chronic pain, and (15) illness with a prognosis of less than one year of life expectancy.


Medical cannabis products initially allowed were pills, oils, gels, creams, ointments, tinctures, liquid, and non-whole plant forms for administration through vaporization. In 2020, the legislature passed SB 339, adding “dry leaf or plant form.” Dispensaries cannot sell edibles, but medical cannabis products could be mixed into food or drinks by patients themselves. Vaporization (or oils) is allowed, but smoking is prohibited.
 In addition to Senate Bill 386, codified in Chapter 16A of the West Virginia Code, the Office of Medical Cannabis has also promulgated regulations governing the activities of growers, processors, laboratories, dispensaries, and general provisions of West Virginia’s medical marijuana program.
 The West Virginia statute creates three categories of licenses that a cannabis business may obtain: (1) grower, (2) processor, and (3) dispensary, corresponding to the growing of medical cannabis, the processing of cannabis plants into the products permitted under West Virginia law, and sales to registered patients, respectively. The statute provides that the Office may issue up to ten grower permits, ten processor permits, and one hundred dispensary permits and that it may not (1) issue more than one grower permit to one person, (2) issue more than one processor permit to one person, and (3) issue more than ten dispensary permits to one person.
 The Office of Medical Cannabis awarded ten grower permits on October 3, 2020. It awarded ten processor permits on November 13, 2020. It awarded one hundred dispensary permits on January 29, 2021, and announced that beginning February 3, 2021, West Virginia residents with qualifying medical conditions would be able to begin to submit applications to become registered patients.
Permits issued by the Office of Medical Cannabis are effective for one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed by applicants in good standing with the terms of a currently effective permit. Permits may be suspended or revoked on the basis of failure to prevent diversion of medical cannabis or violation of laws and rules applicable to medical cannabis businesses.
 All permittees are required to make use of a state-mandated electronic tracking system that is accessible to the Office of Medical Cannabis. Permittees are also subject to requirements related to security and surveillance, recordkeeping and record retention, the acquisition, growth, and processing of medical cannabis, delivery and transportation, and controls on dispensing, including amounts and prices permitted. Growers and processors are required to contract with independent laboratories to test their products according to Office of Medical Cannabis rules.
 Dispensaries are prohibited from dispensing cannabis products to anyone other than a registered patient or caregiver who presents a valid identification card from the Office of Medical Cannabis. Dispensing amounts are limited to those indicated in a registered patient’s certification by his/her medical practitioner, and in any event, a dispensary may not dispense more than a 30-day supply at a given time.
 The Office of Medical Cannabis is permitted to conduct announced or unannounced inspections of permittees to determine their compliance with West Virginia law and regulations, and may inspect a permittee’s site, records, and other data, and may interview employees, principals, operators, and financial backers of the permittee. The Office of Medical Cannabis will have free access to review and, if necessary, make copies of books, records, papers, documents, data, or other physical or electronic information that relates to the business of the dispensary, including financial data, sales data, shipping data, pricing data, and employee data. The Office of Medical Cannabis will have free access to any area within a site or facility that is being used to store medical cannabis for testing purposes and are permitted to collect test samples for testing at an approved laboratory.
 Permittees must have security and surveillance systems utilizing commercial-grade equipment to prevent unauthorized entry and to prevent and detect an adverse loss. The security systems must incorporate a professionally monitored security alarm system that is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and records all activity in images capable of clearly revealing facial detail; have the ability to clearly and accurately display the date and time; record all images captured by each surveillance camera for a minimum of two years in a format that may be easily accessed for investigative purposes; and utilize a security alarm system separate from the facility’s primary security system covering the limited access area or other room where the recordings are stored. Permittees must install commercial-grade, nonresidential doors and door locks on each external door of the facility, with keys or key codes for all doors remaining in possession of designated authorized individuals. During all nonworking hours, all entrances to and exits from the site and facility must be securely locked. Permittees must install lighting to ensure proper surveillance both inside and outside of the facility. Access to rooms containing security and surveillance monitoring equipment must be limited to persons who are essential to maintaining security and surveillance operations; federal, state, and local law enforcement; security and surveillance system service employees; the bureau or its authorized agents; and other persons with the prior written approval of the Office of Medical Cannabis.
 A permittee is permitted to transport and deliver medical cannabis to a medical cannabis organization or an approved laboratory. A grower/processor may contract with a third-party contractor for delivery so long as the contractor complies with the Office of Medical Cannabis’ rules and regulations. A grower/processor must use a global positioning system to ensure safe, efficient delivery of the medical cannabis to a medical cannabis organization or an approved laboratory. Vehicles permitted to transport medical cannabis must be equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area, have no markings that would either identify or indicate that the vehicle is being

used to transport medical cannabis, be capable of being temperature-controlled for perishable medical cannabis, as appropriate, display current state inspection stickers and maintain a current state vehicle registration, and be insured in an amount that is commercially reasonable and appropriate. Medical cannabis stored inside the transport vehicle may not be visible from the outside of the transport vehicle. A transport vehicle is subject to inspection by the bureau or its authorized agents, law enforcement, or other federal or state officials if necessary to perform the government officials’ functions and duties.
