 Packaging Products
 Our containerboard mills produce linerboard and semi-chemical corrugating medium, which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products.
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Packaging segment produced 4.1 million tons of containerboard at our mills. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold 58.9 billion square feet (BSF) of corrugated products. Our net sales to third parties totaled $5.9 billion in 2018.

Facilities
 We currently manufacture containerboard, which includes a variety of performance and specialty grades, at six containerboard mills. Total annual containerboard capacity was approximately 4.4 million tons as of December 31, 2018. We also produce corrugated and protective packaging products at 95 manufacturing locations. The following provides more details of our operations:
 Counce. Our Counce, Tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard on two paper machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb. 
 DeRidder. Our DeRidder, Louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard and semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper machines. The mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb. to 69 lb. and medium in basis weights of 23 lb. to 33 lb. 
 Valdosta. Our Valdosta, Georgia mill produces kraft linerboard on one paper machine. The mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb. 
 Tomahawk. Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill produces semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb.
 Filer City. Our Filer City, Michigan mill produces semi-chemical corrugating medium on three paper machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 20 lb. to 47 lb.
 Wallula. Our Wallula, Washington mill produces semi-chemical corrugating medium on its No. 2 machine and kraft linerboard on its No. 3 machine. The mill can produce medium in basis weights from 23 lb. to 33 lb. and linerboard in basis weights from 31 lb. to 52 lb. As described above, the No. 3 machine was converted from white paper to linerboard in May of 2018.
 We operate 95 corrugated manufacturing and protective packaging operations, a technical and development center, 10 regional design centers, a rotogravure printing operation, and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers. Of the 95 manufacturing facilities, 61 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products, 33 are sheet plants, which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products, and one is a corrugated sheet-only manufacturer.
 Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. Each of our plants serve a market radius of approximately 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items.
 Major Raw Materials Used
 Fiber supply. Fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard. We consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills. Our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood, and recycled sources. All of our mills can utilize virgin wood fiber and all of our mills, other than the Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is consumed by our mills. In 2018, our usage of recycled fiber, net of internal generation, represents 18% of our containerboard production.
 We procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights, long-term supply agreements, and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply for the foreseeable future. 
 We participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification™ (PEFC), as well as the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC), and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics.

Energy supply. Energy at our packaging mills is obtained through self-generated or purchased fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include by-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), natural gas, purchased wood waste, and other purchased fuels. Each of our mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity.
 In 2018, our packaging mills consumed about 70 million MMBTU’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 70 million MMBTU’s consumed, about 64% was from mill generated by-products and 36% was from purchased fuels. Of the purchased fuels, 65% was from natural gas, 31% was from purchased wood waste and 4% was from other purchased fuels.
 Chemical supply. We consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard, including caustic soda, sulfuric acid, soda ash, and lime. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically.
 Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 Our corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization, independent brokers, and distribution partners. We have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence. Additionally, our design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and marketing personnel, we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers. General marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters.
 Our containerboard sales group is responsible for linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and sales to our corrugated plants, to outside domestic customers, and to export customers. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers.
 Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150-mile radius. We sometimes use third-party warehouses for short-term storage of corrugated products.
 Customers
 We sell containerboard and corrugated products to approximately 18,000 customers in over 36,000 locations. About three-quarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining one-quarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of PCA plants. No single customer exceeds 10% of segment sales.
 The primary end-use markets in the United States for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2017 Fibre Box Association annual report:
 
 
Food, beverages, and agricultural products | 44 | %
-------------------------------------------+----+--
Retail and wholesale trade | 22 | %
Paper and other products | 14 | %
Miscellaneous manufacturing | 10 | %
Chemical, plastic, and rubber products | 10 | %

Competition
 As of December 31, 2018, we were the third largest producer of containerboard products in North America, according to industry sources and our own estimates. According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced by about 460 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,200 plants. The primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality, service, price, product design, and innovation. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region. Competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional, although we also face competition from competitors with significant national account presence.

On a national level, our primary competitors are International Paper Company, WestRock Company, Georgia-Pacific LLC, and Pratt Industries. However, with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts, we also compete with the smaller, independent producers.
 Paper
 We are the third largest manufacturer of uncoated freesheet in North America, according to industry sources and our own estimates. We manufacture and sell white papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. White papers consist of communication papers, including cut-size office papers and printing and converting papers. 
Facilities
 We currently have two white paper mills located in the United States. Total annual white paper capacity is 949,000 tons. The following paragraphs describe our white paper mills:
 Jackson. Our Jackson, Alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines. 
 International Falls. Our International Falls, Minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines.
 Wallula. Our Wallula, Washington mill produced pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades on its No. 3 machine, prior to its conversion to kraft linerboard during the second quarter of 2018. 
Major Raw Materials Used
 Fiber supply. Fiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment. We consume wood fiber, recycled fiber, and purchased pulp. Our Jackson mill purchases recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers. We purchase wood fiber through contracts and open-market purchase, and we purchase recycled fiber and pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements. 
 We participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification™ (PEFC), as well as the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC), and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics.
 Energy supply. We obtain energy through self-generated or purchased fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include by-products of the manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), natural gas, electricity, and purchased wood waste. Each of the paper mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity.
 In 2018, our white paper mills consumed about 24 million MMBTU’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 24 million MMBTU’s consumed, about 62% was from mill generated by-products and 38% was from purchased fuels. Of the purchased fuels, 85% was from natural gas and 15% from purchased wood waste. 
 Chemical supply. We consume various chemicals in the production of white papers, including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, caustic soda, and sodium chlorate. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically.
 Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 Our white papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization. We ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck. This allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements.

Customers
 We have over 150 customers in approximately 450 locations. These customers include office products distributors and retailers, paper merchants, and envelope and other converters. We have established long-term relationships with many of our customers. Office Depot, Inc. is our largest customer in the Paper segment. We have an agreement with Office Depot in which we will supply at least 50% of Office Depot's requirements for commodity office papers through December 2019. The agreement will renew automatically through December 2020; however, there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate in 2019. If this were to occur, Office Depot's purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years. In 2018, our sales revenue to Office Depot represented 47% of our Paper segment sales revenue.
Competition
 The markets in which our Paper segment competes are large and highly competitive. Commodity grades of white paper are globally traded, with numerous worldwide manufacturers, and as a result, these products compete primarily on the basis of price. All of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, and although we compete primarily in the domestic market, we do face competition from foreign producers. In 2016, as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before United States international trade authorities, antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, and Portugal. These duties remain in effect. Other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Our largest competitors include Domtar Corporation, International Paper Company, and Georgia-Pacific LLC. We also face competition from foreign producers. Although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades, quality and service are also important competitive determinants. Our white papers compete with electronic data transmission, e-readers, electronic document storage alternatives, and paper grades we do not produce. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers.
 Corporate and Other
 Our Corporate and Other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities. This segment also includes transportation assets, such as rail cars and trucks, which we use to transport some of our products to and from our manufacturing sites, and assets related to a 50% owned variable interest entity, Louisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP).
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 15,000 employees, including 4,500 salaried and 10,500 hourly employees. Approximately 63% of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The majority of our unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW). We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future. During 2018, we experienced no work stoppages, and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees.
