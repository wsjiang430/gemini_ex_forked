Our Company
Fitness for everyone
We are one of the largest and fastest-growing franchisors and operators of fitness centers in the United States by number of members and locations, with a highly recognized national brand. Our mission is to enhance people’s lives by providing a high-quality fitness experience in a welcoming, non-intimidating environment, which we call the Judgement Free Zone, where anyone—and we mean anyone—can feel they belong. Our bright, clean stores are typically 20,000 square feet, with a large selection of high-quality, purple and yellow Planet Fitness-branded cardio, circuit- and weight-training equipment and friendly staff trainers who offer unlimited free fitness instruction to all our members in small groups through our PE@PF program. We offer this differentiated fitness experience at only $10 per month for our standard membership. This attractive value proposition is designed to appeal to a broad population, including occasional gym users and the approximately 80% of the U.S. and Canadian populations over age 14 who are not gym members, particularly those who find the traditional fitness club setting intimidating and expensive. We and our franchisees fiercely protect Planet Fitness’ community atmosphere—a place where you do not need to be fit before joining and where progress toward achieving your fitness goals (big or small) is supported and applauded by our staff and fellow members.
Our judgement-free approach to fitness and attractive value proposition have enabled us to grow our revenues to $572.9 million in 2018 and to become an industry leader with $2.8 billion in system-wide sales during 2018 (which we define as monthly dues and annual fees billed by us and our franchisees), and approximately 12.5 million members and 1,742 stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Mexico as of December 31, 2018. System-wide sales for 2018 include $2.6 billion attributable to franchisee-owned stores, from which we generate royalty revenue, and $137.9 million attributable to our corporate-owned stores. Of our 1,742 stores, 1,666 are franchised and 76 are corporate-owned. Our stores are successful in a wide range of geographies and demographics. According to internal and third-party analysis, we believe we have the opportunity to grow our store count to over 4,000 stores in the U.S. alone. Under signed area development agreements (“ADAs”) as of December 31, 2018, our franchisees have committed to open more than 1,000 additional stores.
In 2018, our corporate-owned stores had segment EBITDA margin of 40.9% and had average unit volumes (“AUVs”) of approximately $2.0 million with four-wall EBITDA margins (an assessment of store-level profitability which includes local and national advertising expense) of approximately 46%, or approximately 39% after applying the current 7% royalty rate, which includes 1.59% royalty as a result of the elimination of certain rebates and commissions that were previously paid by all stores and deducted as an expense in arriving at four wall EBITDA. We believe this to be comparable to a franchise store under our current franchise agreement. Based on a historical survey of franchisees, we believe that, on average, our franchise stores achieve four-wall EBITDA margins in line with these corporate-owned store EBITDA margins. Our strong member value proposition has also driven growth throughout a variety of economic cycles and conditions. For a reconciliation of segment EBITDA margin to four-wall EBITDA margin for corporate-owned stores, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”
Our significant growth is reflected in:


• | 1,742 stores as of December 31, 2018, compared to 918 as of December 31, 2014, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17.4%;


• | 12.5 million members as of December 31, 2018, compared to 6.1 million as of December 31, 2014, reflecting a CAGR of 19.9%;


• | 2018 system-wide sales of $2.8 billion, reflecting a CAGR of 23.4%, or increase of $1.6 billion, since 2014


• | 2018 total revenue of $572.9 million, reflecting a CAGR of 19.6%, or increase of $293.1 million, since 2014, of which 0.4% is attributable to revenues from corporate-owned stores acquired from franchisees since January 1, 2014;


• | 48 consecutive quarters of system-wide same store sales growth (which we define as year-over-year growth solely of monthly dues from stores that have been open and for which membership dues have been billed for longer than 12 months);


• | 2018 net income of $103.2 million, reflecting a CAGR of 29.0%, or increase of $65.9 million, since 2014. Our historical results, prior to our initial public offering, benefit from insignificant income taxes due to our status as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we anticipate future results will not be comparable to periods prior to our IPO as our income attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc. is now subject to U.S. federal and state taxes;


• | 2018 Adjusted EBITDA of $223.2 million, reflecting a CAGR of 22.1%, or increase of $122.7 million, since 2014; and


• | 2018 Adjusted net income of $119.5 million compared to $82.3 million in 2017, an increase of 45.3%.

Planet Fitness – Home of the Judgement Free Zone
We bring fitness to a large, previously underserved segment of the population. Our differentiated member experience is driven by three key elements:


• | Welcoming, non-intimidating environment: We believe every member should feel accepted and respected when they walk into a Planet Fitness. Our stores provide a Judgement Free Zone where members of all fitness levels can enjoy a non-intimidating environment. Our “come as you are” approach has fostered a strong sense of community among our members, allowing them not only to feel comfortable as they work toward their fitness goals but also to encourage others to do the same. By outfitting our gyms with more cardiovascular and light strength equipment, and not offering heavy free weights, we reinforce our Judgement Free Zone philosophy by discouraging what we call “Lunk” behavior, such as dropping weights and grunting, that can be intimidating to new and occasional gym users. In addition, to help maintain our welcoming, judgement-free environment, each store is required to have a purple and yellow branded “Lunk” alarm on the wall that staff occasionally rings as a light-hearted reminder of our policies.


• | Distinct store experience: Our bright, clean, large-format stores offer our members a selection of high-quality, purple and yellow Planet Fitness-branded cardio, circuit- and weight-training equipment that is commonly used by first-time and occasional gym users. Because our stores are typically 20,000 square feet and we do not offer non-essential amenities such as group exercise classes, pools, day care centers and juice bars, we have more space for the equipment our members do use. We believe our tailored use of space is, at least in part, why we have not needed to impose time limits on our cardio machines.


• | Exceptional value for members: Both our standard and PF Black Card memberships are priced significantly below the industry median of $61 per month and still provide our members with a high-quality fitness experience. In the U.S., for only $10 per month, our standard membership includes unlimited access to one Planet Fitness location and unlimited free

5

fitness instruction to all members in small groups through our PE@PF program. And, for approximately $21.99 per month, our PF Black Card members have access to all of our stores system-wide and can bring a guest on each visit, which provides an additional opportunity to attract new members. Our PF Black Card members also have access to exclusive areas in our stores that provide amenities such as water massage beds, massage chairs, tanning equipment and more.
Our differentiated approach to fitness has allowed us to create an attractive franchise model that is both profitable and scalable. We recognize that our success depends on a shared passion with our franchisees for providing a distinctive store experience based on a judgement-free environment and an exceptional value for our members. We seek to enhance the attractiveness of our streamlined, easy-to-operate franchise model by providing franchisees with extensive operational support relating to site selection and development, marketing and training. We also take a highly collaborative, teamwork approach to our relationship with franchisees, as captured by our motto “One Team, One Planet.” We believe the strength of our brand and the attractiveness of our franchise model are evidenced by the fact that over 90% of our new stores in 2018 were opened by our existing franchisee base.
Our competitive strengths
We attribute our success to the following strengths:

• | Market leader with differentiated member experience, nationally recognized brand and scale advantage. We believe we are the largest operator of fitness centers in the U.S. by number of members, with approximately 12.5 million members as of December 31, 2018. Our franchisee-owned and corporate-owned stores generated $2.8 billion in system-wide sales during 2018. Through our differentiated member experience, nationally recognized brand and scale advantage, we will continue to deliver a compelling value proposition to our members and our franchisees and, we believe, grow our store and total membership base.


• | Differentiated member experience. We seek to provide our members with a high-quality fitness experience in a non-intimidating, judgement-free environment at an exceptional value. We have a dedicated Brand Excellence team that seeks to ensure that all our franchise stores uphold our brand standards and deliver a consistent Planet Fitness member experience in every store.


• | Nationally recognized brand. We have developed a highly relatable and recognizable brand that emphasizes our focus on providing our members with a judgement-free environment. We do so through fun and memorable marketing campaigns and in-store signage that highlights the judgement people face in their everyday lives and how at Planet Fitness, they can be free to be themselves. As a result, we have among the highest aided and unaided brand awareness scores in the U.S. fitness industry, according to our Brand Health research, a third-party consumer study that we have executed bi-annually. Our brand strength also helps our franchisees attract members, with new stores in 2018 signing up an average of more than 1,300 members even before opening their doors.


• | Scale advantage. Our scale provides several competitive advantages, including enhanced purchasing power with our fitness equipment and other suppliers and the ability to attract high-quality franchisee partners. In addition, we estimate that our large U.S. national advertising fund, funded by franchisees and us, together with our requirement that franchisees generally spend 7% of their monthly membership dues on local advertising, have enabled us and our franchisees to spend over $650 million since 2011 on marketing to drive consumer brand awareness and preference.


• | Exceptional value proposition that appeals to a broad member demographic. We offer a high-quality and consistent fitness experience throughout our entire store base at low monthly membership dues. Combined with our non-intimidating and welcoming environment, we are able to attract a broad member demographic based on age, household income, gender and ethnicity. Our member base is over 50% female and our members come from both high- and low-income households. Our broad appeal and ability to attract occasional and first-time gym users enable us to continue to target a large segment of the population in a variety of markets and geographies across North America, including Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Mexico.


• | Strong store-level economics. Our store model is designed to generate attractive four-wall EBITDA margins, strong free cash flow and high returns on invested capital for both our corporate-owned and franchise stores. Average four-wall EBITDA margins for our corporate-owned stores have increased significantly since 2014, driven by higher average members per store as well as a higher percentage of PF Black Card members, which leverage our relatively fixed costs. In 2018, our corporate-owned stores had segment EBITDA margin of 40.9% and had AUVs of approximately $2.0 million with four-wall EBITDA margins of approximately 46%, or approximately 39% after applying the current 7% royalty rate, which includes 1.59% royalty as a result of the elimination of certain rebates and commissions that were previously paid by all stores and deducted as an expense in arriving at four-wall EBITDA. We believe this to be comparable to a franchise store under our current franchise agreement. Based on a historical survey of franchisees, we believe that our franchise

6

stores achieve four-wall EBITDA margins in line with these corporate-owned store EBITDA margins. We believe that our strong store-level economics are important to our ability to attract and retain successful franchisees and grow our store base.

• | Highly attractive franchise system built for growth. Our easy-to-operate model, strong store-level economics and brand strength have enabled us to attract a team of professional, successful franchisees from a variety of industries. We believe that our franchise model enables us to scale more rapidly than a company-owned model. Our streamlined model features relatively fixed labor costs, minimal inventory, automatic billing and limited cash transactions. Our franchisees enjoy recurring monthly member dues, regardless of member use, weather or other factors. Based on historical survey data and management estimates, we believe our franchisees can earn, in their second year of operations, on average, a cash-on-cash return on initial investment greater than 25% after royalties and advertising, which is in line with our corporate-owned stores. The attractiveness of our franchise model is further evidenced by the fact that our franchisees re-invest their capital with us, with over 90% of our new stores in 2018 opened by our existing franchisee base, as well as 48 consecutive quarters of same store sales growth, including system-wide same store sales growth of 10.2% in 2018. We view our franchisees as strategic partners in expanding the Planet Fitness store base and brand.


• | Predictable and recurring revenue streams with high cash flow conversion. Our business model provides us with predictable and recurring revenue streams. In 2018, approximately 90% of both our corporate-owned store and franchise revenues consisted of recurring revenue streams, which include royalties, vendor commissions, monthly dues and annual fees. In addition, our franchisees are obligated to purchase fitness equipment from us or our required vendor for their new stores and to replace this equipment every five to seven years. As a result, these “equip” and “re-equip” requirements create a predictable and growing revenue stream as our franchisees open new stores under their ADAs. By re-investing in stores, we and our franchisees strive to maintain and enhance our member experience. Our predictable and recurring revenue streams, combined with our attractive margins and minimal capital requirements, result in high cash flow conversion and increased capacity to invest in future growth initiatives.


• | Proven, experienced management team driving a strong culture. Our strategic vision and unique culture have been developed and fostered by our senior management team under the stewardship of Chief Executive Officer, Chris Rondeau. Mr. Rondeau has been with Planet Fitness for over 25 years and helped develop the Planet Fitness business model and brand elements that give us our distinct personality and spirited culture. Dorvin Lively, our President and Chief Financial Officer, brings valuable expertise from over 35 years of corporate finance experience with companies such as RadioShack and Ace Hardware, and from the initial public offering of Maidenform Brands. We have assembled a management team that shares our passion for “fitness for everyone” and has extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines, including retail, franchising, finance, consumer marketing, digital strategies, brand development and information technology. We believe our senior management team is a key driver of our success and has positioned us well to execute our long-term growth strategy.

Our growth strategies
We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our brand awareness, increase our revenues and profitability and deliver shareholder value by executing on the following strategies:


• | Continue to grow our store base across a broad range of markets. We have grown our store count over the last five years, expanding from 918 stores as of December 31, 2014 to 1,742 stores as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our franchisees have signed ADAs to open more than 1,000 additional stores, including more than 500 over the next three years. Because our stores are successful across a wide range of geographies and demographics with varying population densities, we believe that our high level of brand awareness and low per capita penetration in certain markets create a significant opportunity to open new Planet Fitness stores. Based on our internal and third-party analysis, we believe we have the potential to grow our store base to over 4,000 stores in the U.S. alone. 


• | Drive revenue growth and system-wide same store sales. Because we provide a high-quality, affordable, non-intimidating fitness experience that is designed for first-time and occasional gym users, we have achieved positive system-wide same store sales growth in each of the past 48 quarters. We expect to continue to grow system-wide same store sales primarily by: 


• | Attracting new members to existing Planet Fitness stores. As the population in the markets where we operate continue to focus on health and wellness, we believe we are well-positioned to capture a disproportionate share of these populations given our appeal to first-time and occasional gym users. In addition, because our stores offer a large, focused selection of equipment geared toward first-time and occasional gym users, we are able to service higher member volumes without sacrificing the member experience. We have also continued to evolve our offerings to appeal to our target member base,

7

including the introduction of TRX® and other functional training modalities (e.g., medicine balls, stability balls, kettlebells, etc.) within designated areas, as well as dedicated fitness programming to accompany this new equipment. We have also continued to enhance the PE@PF Program, our proprietary small group training program.

• | Increasing mix of PF Black Card memberships by enhancing value and member experience. We expect to drive sales by continuing to convert our existing members with standard membership dues at $10 per month to our premium PF Black Card membership with dues at approximately $21.99 per month as well as attracting new members to join at the PF Black Card level. We encourage this upgrade by continuing to enhance the value of our PF Black Card benefits through additional in-store amenities, such as hydro-massage beds, and affinity partnerships for discounts and promotions. Since 2014, our PF Black Card members as a percentage of total membership has increased from 55% as of December 31, 2014 to 60% as of December 31, 2018, and our average monthly dues per member have increased from $15.58 to $16.52 over the same period. 

We may also explore other future revenue opportunities, such as optimizing member pricing and fees, offering new merchandise and services inside and outside our stores, and securing affinity and other corporate partnerships.

• | Increase brand awareness to drive growth. We plan to continue to increase our strong brand awareness by leveraging significant marketing expenditures by our franchisees and us, which we believe will result in increasing membership in new and existing stores and continue to attract high-quality franchisee partners. Under our current franchise agreement, franchisees are required to contribute 2% of their monthly membership dues to our National Advertising Fund (“NAF”), from which we spent $42.6 million in 2018 alone to support our national marketing campaigns, our social media platforms and the development of local advertising materials. Under our current franchise agreement, franchisees are also required to spend 7% of their monthly membership dues on local advertising. We expect both our NAF and local advertising spending to grow as our membership grows.


• | Continue to expand royalties from increases in average royalty rate and new franchisees. During 2017, we increased our current royalty rate to 7% and at the same time, for new franchisees and existing franchisees on our current royalty rate structure, we eliminated certain commissions that were paid to us by franchisees and rebates that were earned by us through franchisee purchases from third-party vendors. The eliminated commissions and rebates equate to approximately 1.59% of an average franchisee’s monthly dues and annual fees based on system-wide averages. The current royalty rate of 7% includes this 1.59%. We also offered existing franchisees the opportunity to eliminate such commissions and rebates in exchange for a royalty rate increase of 1.59%. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 86% of our franchisee owned stores increased their royalty rates and are no longer subject to such commissions and rebates.

While our current franchise agreement stipulates monthly royalty rates of 7% of monthly dues and annual membership fees, only 16% of our stores are paying royalties at the current franchise agreement rate, primarily due to lower rates in historical agreements. As new franchisees enter our system and, generally, as current franchisees open new stores or renew their existing franchise agreements at the current royalty rate, our average system-wide royalty rate will increase. In 2018, our average royalty rate was 5.61% compared to 2.95% in 2014. In addition to rising average royalty rates, total royalty revenue will continue to grow as we expand our franchise store base and increase franchise same store sales.

• | Grow sales from fitness equipment and related services. Our franchisees are contractually obligated to purchase fitness equipment from us, and in international markets, from our required vendors. Due to our scale and negotiating power, we believe we offer competitive pricing for high-quality, purple and yellow Planet Fitness-branded fitness equipment. We expect our equipment sales to grow as our U.S. franchisees open new stores and replace used equipment. In international markets, we earn a commission on the sale of equipment by our required vendors to franchisee-owned stores. Additionally, all franchisees are required to replace their existing equipment with new equipment every five to seven years. As the number of franchise stores continues to increase and existing franchise stores continue to mature, we anticipate incremental growth in revenue related to the sale of equipment to U.S. franchisees and commissions on the sale of equipment to international franchisees. In addition, we believe that regularly refreshing equipment helps our franchise stores maintain a consistent, high-quality fitness experience and is one of the contributing factors that drives new member growth. 

Our industry
Due to our unique positioning to a broader demographic, we believe Planet Fitness has an addressable market that is significantly larger than the traditional health club industry. We view our addressable market as approximately 255 million people, representing the U.S. population over 14 years of age. We compete broadly for consumer discretionary spending related to leisure, sports, entertainment and other non-fitness activities in addition to the traditional health club market.

According to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (“IHRSA”), the U.S. health club industry generated approximately $30.0 billion in revenue in 2017. The industry is highly fragmented, with 38,500 clubs across the U.S. serving approximately 60.9 million members, according to IHRSA. In 2017, the U.S. health club industry grew by 5.3% in number of units and 6.3% in number of members compared to Planet Fitness, which grew by 15.6% and 19.9%, respectively. IHRSA data is not yet available for 2018, but Planet Fitness grew its number of stores by 14.8% and its number of members by 17.4% in 2018. Over the next five years, industry sources project that U.S. health club industry revenues will grow at an annualized rate of approximately 1.5%, primarily attributed to an increase in discretionary spending coupled with continued consumer awareness and public initiatives on the health benefits of exercise. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends, and our impressive growth reinforces our distinct approach to fitness and broad demographic appeal.
Our brand philosophy
We are a brand built on passion and the belief that anyone can achieve their personal wellness goals in a non-intimidating, judgement-free environment. We have become a nationally recognized consumer brand that stands for the welcoming environment, value and quality we provide our members.
The Judgement Free Zone. Planet Fitness is the home of the Judgement Free Zone. It is a place where people of all fitness levels can feel comfortable working out at their own pace, feel supported in their efforts and not feel intimidated by pushy salespeople or other members who may ruin their fitness experience. Our philosophy is simple: Planet Fitness is an environment where members can relax, go at their own pace and be themselves without ever having to worry about being judged. Behaviors such as grunting, dropping weights or judging others are not allowed in our stores.
All This for Only That. Planet Fitness monthly membership dues typically range from only $10 to $21.99 in the U.S. We pride ourselves on providing a high-quality experience at an exceptional value, not an “economy” fitness experience.
No Lunks. Lunks are people who intimidate others at the gym. To help maintain our judgement-free environment, each store has a purple and yellow branded “Lunk” alarm on the wall that our staff occasionally rings as a light-hearted, gentle reminder of our policies.
You Belong. We do a lot of little things to make members feel like part of our community—like saying hello and goodbye to everyone who enters our stores, providing Tootsie Rolls at the front desk so that our staff has another opportunity to engage with members, and other membership appreciation gestures such as providing free pizza and bagels to our members once a month as a way to build community and reinforce that fitness can be fun.
Planet of Triumphs. All of our members are working toward their goals—from a single push-up to making it to Planet Fitness twice in a week to losing hundreds of pounds. No matter what size the goal, we believe that all of these accomplishments deserve to be celebrated. Planet of Triumphs (www.PlanetofTriumphs.com) is an elevating, inspiring, Judgement Free social community of real members where all stories are welcome. Planet of Triumphs provides an online platform for members to recognize their triumphs (big and small), share their stories and encourage others, while spotlighting our unique brand belief that everyone belongs.
Membership
We make it simple for members to join, whether online or in-store—no pushy sales tactics, no pressure and no complicated rate structures. Our corporate-owned stores provide incentive compensation for store staff to successfully drive key business metrics in the service, personnel and financial categories, and we encourage our franchisees to follow our lead. Our regional managers review our corporate stores multiple times per month for quality control, including generally one visit per month during which they evaluate store cleanliness based upon internally established criteria. Our members generally pay the following amounts (or an equivalent amount in the store’s local currency):

• | monthly membership dues of only $10 for our standard membership, or approximately $21.99 for PF Black Card members;


• | current standard annual fees of approximately $39; and


• | enrollment fees of approximately $0 to $59.

Belonging to a Planet Fitness store has perks whether members select the standard membership or the premium PF Black Card membership. Every member gets to take part can take advantage of free pizza and bagels once a month and gets free, unlimited fitness instruction included in their monthly membership fee. Our PF Black Card members also have the right to reciprocal use of all Planet Fitness stores, can bring a friend with them each time they work out, and have access to massage beds and chairs and tanning, among other benefits. PF Black Card benefits extend beyond our store as well, with exclusive specials and discount offers 
9

from third-party retail partners. While some of our memberships require a cancellation fee, we offer, and require our franchisees to offer, a non-committal membership option.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 12.5 million members. We utilize electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) as our primary method of collecting monthly dues and annual membership fees. Over 85% of membership fee payments to our corporate-owned and franchise stores are collected via Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) direct debit. We believe there are certain advantages to receiving a higher concentration of ACH payments, as compared to credit cards payments, including less frequent expiration of billing information and reduced exposure to subjective chargeback or dispute claims and fees. Due to our scale and negotiating power, we believe that our third party payment processors offer a competitive bundle of transaction pricing and support services to our franchisees while facilitating revenue collection by us.
Our stores
We had 1,742 stores system-wide as of December 31, 2018, of which 1,666 were franchised and 76 were corporate-owned, located in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Mexico. The map below shows our franchisee-owned stores by location, and the accompanying table shows our corporate-owned stores by location. Under signed ADAs, as of December 31, 2018, franchisees have committed to open more than 1,000 additional stores.

Franchisee-owned store count by location

Our format
Many traditional gyms include expensive add-ons such as pools, group exercise rooms, daycare facilities and juice bars that require additional maintenance expense and staffing. We have removed these unnecessary and expense-adding facilities and services and replaced them with additional cardio and strength equipment, which we believe allows us to serve more members without imposing time limits on equipment use. We believe our streamlined offerings appeal to the core needs of most gym users, especially first-time or occasional gym users.
Our stores are designed and outfitted to match our brand philosophy, with bright, bold purple and yellow color schemes and purple and yellow Planet Fitness-branded equipment and amenities. Our typical store is 20,000 square feet in single or multi-level retail space. Our stores generally include at least 75 to 100 pieces of co-branded cardio equipment, free weights, strength machines, a 30-minute circuit workout area, a small retail area and a drink cooler. For our PF Black Card members, our stores also generally feature a PF Black Card spa area with total body enhancement machines, massage beds or chairs and tanning.

Store model
Our store model is designed to generate attractive four-wall EBITDA margins, strong free cash flow and high returns on invested capital for both our corporate-owned and franchise stores. Based on a historical survey of franchisees and management estimates, we believe that our franchise stores achieve store-level profitability in line with our corporate-owned store base. The stores included in this survey represent those stores that voluntarily disclosed such information in response to our request, and we believe this information reflects a representative sample of franchisees based on the franchisee groups and geographic areas represented by these stores. Our average four-wall EBITDA margins for our corporate-owned stores have increased significantly since 2012, driven by higher average members per store as well as a higher percentage of PF Black Card members, which leverages our fixed costs. In 2018, our corporate-owned stores had segment EBITDA margin of 40.9% and had AUVs of approximately $2.0 million with four-wall EBITDA margins of approximately 46%, or approximately 39% after applying the current 7% royalty rate, which includes 1.59% royalty as a result of the elimination of certain rebates and commissions that were previously paid by all stores and deducted as an expense in arriving at four wall EBITDA. We believe this to be comparable to a franchise store, under our current franchise agreement. Based on survey data and management analysis, franchisees have historically earned, and we believe can continue to earn, in their second year of operations, on average, a cash-on-cash return on unlevered (i.e., not debt-financed) initial investment greater than 25% after royalties and advertising, which is in line with our corporate-owned stores. A franchisee’s initial investment includes fitness equipment purchased from us (or from our required vendors in the case of our franchisees in international markets) as well as costs for non-fitness equipment and leasehold improvements. The attractiveness of our franchise model is further evidenced by the fact that over 90% of our new stores in 2018 were opened by our existing franchisee base. We believe that our strong store-level economics are important to our ability to attract and retain successful franchisees and grow our store base.
Fitness equipment
We provide our members with high-quality, Planet Fitness-branded fitness equipment from leading suppliers. In order to maintain a consistent experience across our store base, we stipulate specific pieces and quantities of cardio and strength-training equipment and work with franchisees to review and approve layouts and placement. Due to our scale, we are able to negotiate competitive pricing and secure extended warranties from our suppliers. As a result, we believe we offer equipment at more attractive pricing than franchisees could otherwise secure on their own.
Leases
We lease all but one of our corporate-owned stores and our corporate headquarters. Our store leases typically have initial terms of 10 years with two five-year renewal options, exercisable in our discretion. In October, 2016, we executed a lease for our current corporate headquarters at 4 Liberty Lane West, Hampton, New Hampshire, for an initial term of 15 years with one five-year renewal option, exercisable at our discretion. Our corporate headquarters serves as our base of operations for substantially all of our executive management and employees who provide our primary corporate support functions, including finance, legal, marketing, technology, real estate, development and human resources.
Franchisees own or directly lease from a third-party each Planet Fitness franchise location. We have not historically owned or entered into leases for Planet Fitness franchise stores and generally do not guarantee franchisees’ lease agreements, although we have done so in a few isolated instances.
Franchising
Franchising strategy
We rely heavily on our franchising strategy to develop new Planet Fitness stores, leveraging the ownership of entrepreneurs with specific local market expertise. As of December 31, 2018, there were 1,666 franchised Planet Fitness stores operated by approximately 150 franchisee groups. The majority of our existing franchise operators are multi-unit operators. As of December 31, 2018, 96% of all franchise stores were owned and operated by a franchisee group that owns at least three stores. However, while our largest franchisee owns 119 stores, only 24% of our franchisee groups own more than ten stores. When considering a potential franchisee, we generally evaluate the potential franchisee’s prior experience in franchising or other multi-unit businesses, history in managing profit and loss operations, financial history and available capital and financing. We generally do not permit franchisees to borrow more than 80% of the initial investment for their Planet Fitness business.

Area development agreements
An ADA specifies the number of Planet Fitness stores to be developed by the franchisee in a designated geographic area, and requires the franchisee to meet certain scheduled deadlines for the development and opening of each Planet Fitness store authorized by the ADA. If the franchisee meets those obligations and otherwise complies with the terms of the ADA, we agree not to, during the term of the ADA, operate or franchise new Planet Fitness stores in the designated geographic area. The franchisee must sign a separate franchise agreement with us for each Planet Fitness store developed under an ADA and that franchise agreement governs the franchisee’s right to own and operate the Planet Fitness store.
Franchise agreements
For each franchised Planet Fitness store, we enter into a franchise agreement covering standard terms and conditions. Planet Fitness franchisees are not granted an exclusive area or territory under the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement requires that the franchisee operate the Planet Fitness store at a specific location and in compliance with our standard methods of operation, including providing the services, using the vendors and selling the merchandise that we require. The typical franchise agreement has a 10-year term. Additionally, franchisees must purchase equipment from us (or our required vendors in the case of our franchisees located in international markets) and replace the fitness equipment in their stores every five to seven years and periodically refurbish and remodel their stores.
We currently require each franchisee to designate a responsible owner and an approved operator for each Planet Fitness store that will have primary management authority for that store. We require these franchisees to complete our initial and ongoing training programs, including minimum periods of classroom and on-the-job training.
Site selection and approval
Our stores are generally located in free-standing retail buildings or neighborhood shopping centers, and we consider locations in both high- and low-density markets. We seek out locations with (i) high visibility and accessibility, (ii) favorable traffic counts and patterns, (iii) availability of signage, (iv) ample parking or access to public transportation and (v) our targeted demographics. We use third-party site analytics tools that provide us with extensive demographic data and analysis that we use to review new and existing sites and markets for our corporate-owned stores and franchisees. We assess population density and drive time, current tenant mix, layout, potential competition and impact on existing Planet Fitness stores and comparative data based upon existing stores—all the way down to optimal ceiling heights and HVAC requirements. Our real estate team meets regularly to review sites for future development and follows a detailed review process to ensure each site aligns with our strategic growth objectives and critical success factors.
We help franchisees select sites and develop facilities in these stores that conform to the physical specifications for a Planet Fitness store. As part of our process to support our franchisees growth in local markets under their ADAs, we also assist them in finding real estate locations for new stores. One way we do this is by having regional real estate professionals work directly with franchisees and their real estate brokers, landlords and developers. Each franchisee is responsible for selecting a site, but must obtain site approval from us. We primarily learn of new sites in two ways. First, we have a formal site-approval submission process for landlords and franchisees. Each site submitted to us is reviewed by a subcommittee of our real estate team for brand qualifications. Second, we proactively review real estate portfolios for appropriate sites that we may consider for corporate-owned stores or franchisee development, depending upon location.
We are also involved in real estate organizations such as the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), a trade organization for the international shopping center industry. Our membership in ICSC allows us to gather data, meet prospective landlords and further enhance our reputation as a desired tenant for shopping centers.
Design and construction
Once we have approved a franchisee’s site selection, we assist in the design and layout of the store and track the franchisee’s progress from lease signing to grand opening. Franchisees are offered the assistance of our franchise support team to track key milestones, coordinate with vendors and make equipment purchases. Certain Planet Fitness brand elements are required to be incorporated into every new store, and we strive for a consistent appearance across all of our stores, emphasizing clean, attractive facilities, including full-size locker rooms, and modern equipment. Franchisees must abide by our standards related to fixtures, finishes and design elements, including distinctive touches such as our “Lunk” alarm. We believe these elements are critical to ensure brand consistency and member experience system-wide.
In 2018 and 2017, based on a sample of U.S. franchisee data, we believe construction of franchise stores averaged approximately 14 weeks. We sampled construction costs to build new stores from across a wide range of U.S. geographies, 56 and 49 new stores, in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Based upon these samples, franchisees’ unlevered (i.e., not debt-financed) investment to open a new store ranged from approximately $1.4 million to $3.2 million and $1.5 million to $3.2 million, based upon our samples in 
12

2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts include fitness equipment purchased from us as well as costs for non-fitness equipment and leasehold improvements and is based in part upon data we received from four general contractors that oversaw the construction of the stores in the sample set. Additionally, these amounts include an estimate of other costs that are typically paid by the franchisee and not managed by the general contractor. These amounts can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including landlord allowances for tenant improvements and construction costs from different geographies and does not necessarily represent the total construction costs on a cash basis.
Franchisee support
We live and breathe the motto One Team, One Planet in our daily interactions with franchisees. Our franchise model is streamlined and easy-to-operate, with efficient staffing and minimal inventory, and is supported by an active, engaged franchise operations system. We provide our franchisees with operational support, marketing materials and training resources. Our strong and long-lasting partnership with our franchisees is reflected in the fact that over 90% of our new stores in 2018 were opened by our existing franchisee base.
Training.  We continue to update and expand, Planet Fitness University, a comprehensive training resource to help franchisees operate successful stores. Courses are delivered online, and content focuses on customer service, operational policies, brand standards, cleanliness, security awareness, crisis management and vendor product information. The core online curriculum is offered in both English and Spanish to support our Spanish-speaking team members. We regularly add and improve the content available on Planet Fitness University as a no-cost service to help enhance training programs for franchisees. Additional training opportunities offered to our franchisees include new owner orientation, operations training and workshops held at Planet Fitness headquarters, in stores and through regularly held webinars.
Operational support and communication.  We believe spending quality time with our franchisees in person is an important opportunity to further strengthen our relationships and share best practices. We have dedicated operations and marketing teams providing ongoing support to franchisees. We are hands on—we often attend franchisees’ presales and grand openings, and we host franchisee meetings each year, known as “PF Huddles.” We also communicate regularly with our entire franchisee base to keep them informed, and we host a franchise conference approximately every 18 months that is geared towards franchisees and their operations teams.
We regularly communicate with the franchisee advisory groups described below and send a weekly email communication to all franchisees with timely “news you can use” information related to operations, marketing, financing and equipment. Every month, a franchisee newsletter is sent to all franchisees, which includes a personal letter from our Chief Executive Officer, important updates on the business and benchmarking reports.
Franchisee relations.  Because our ability to execute our strategy is dependent upon the strength of our relationships with our franchisees, we maintain an ongoing dialogue and strong relationship with two franchise advisory groups, the Franchise Advisory Council (“FAC”) and the Planet Fitness Independent Franchise Association (“PFIFA”). The FAC includes seven franchisees elected by the franchisee base and numerous committees consisting of approximately 40 franchisees. The FAC and its committees provide feedback and input on major brand initiatives, new product and service introductions, technology initiatives, marketing programs and advertising campaigns. FAC leaders have regular dialogue with our executive team and work closely with us to advise on major initiatives impacting the brand. Our strong culture of working together is the driving force behind all we do. In 2014, in cooperation with us, our franchisees also organized PFIFA.
Compliance with brand standards—Franchise Business Coach
We have a dedicated field support team of franchise business coaches focused on ensuring that our franchise stores adhere to brand standards and providing ongoing assistance, training and coaching to all franchisees. We generally perform a site visit and operations review on each franchise store within 30 to 60 days of opening, and each franchise ownership group is visited at least once per year in multiple locations, for a business review with their franchise business coach thereafter. 
We perform store reviews based on a wide range of criteria ranging from cleanliness to brand compliance, layout requirements and operational standards. We record the results of each visit and automatically send a report to the appropriate franchisee. Results are also available to the franchisee through our systems, which provide access to regional and international benchmarking data, allowing franchisees to compare overall results among their peers as well as results based upon each criterion. Stores that do not receive a passing score are automatically flagged for follow-up by our team, are provided with an action plan for the franchisee to complete and will generally be reevaluated within 30 to 60 days to ensure all identified issues have been addressed. The system also enables franchisees to perform, track and benchmark self-assessments and online member surveys.
13

We also use mystery shoppers to perform anonymous reviews of franchise stores. We generally select franchise stores for review randomly but also target underperforming stores and stores that have not performed well on previous visits from their franchise business coach.
Marketing
Marketing strategy
Our marketing strategy is anchored by our key brand differentiators—the Judgement Free Zone, our exceptional value and our high-quality experience. We are well known for our memorable and creative advertising, which not only drives membership sales, but also showcases our brand philosophy, humor and innovation in the industry. We see Planet Fitness as a community gathering place, and the heart of our marketing strategy is to create a welcoming community for our members.
Marketing spending
National advertising.  We support our franchisees both at a national and local level. We manage the U.S. NAF and Canadian advertising fund for franchisees and corporate-owned stores, with the goals of generating national awareness through national advertising and media partnerships, developing and maintaining creative assets to support local sale periods throughout the year, and building and supporting the Planet Fitness community via digital, social media and public relations. Our current U.S. and Canadian franchise agreement requires franchisees to contribute 2% of their monthly EFT to the NAF and Canadian advertising fund, respectively. Since the U.S. NAF was founded in September 2011, it has enabled us to spend approximately $185.8 million to increase national brand awareness, including $44.8 million in 2018, $2.2 million of which is from our corporate-owned stores and included in store-operations expense on the consolidated statements of operations. We believe this is a powerful marketing tool as it allows us to increase brand awareness in new and existing markets.
Local marketing.  Our current franchise agreement requires franchisees to spend 7% of their monthly EFT on local marketing to support branding efforts and promotional sale periods throughout the year. In situations where multiple ownership groups exist in a geographic area, we have the ability to require franchisees to form or join regional marketing cooperatives to maximize the impact of their marketing spending. Our corporate-owned stores contribute to, and participate in, regional marketing cooperatives with franchisees where practical. All franchise stores are supported by our dedicated franchisee marketing team, which provides guidance, tracking, measurement and advice on best practices. Franchisees spend their marketing dollars in a variety of ways to promote business at their stores on a local level. These methods typically include media vehicles that are effective on a local level, including direct mail, outdoor (including billboards), television, radio and digital advertisements and local partnerships and sponsorships.
Media partnerships
Given our scale and marketing resources through our national advertising fund, we have aligned ourselves with high-profile media partners who have helped to extend the global reach of our brand. For the past four years, we have been the presenting sponsor of “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest.” This has allowed us to showcase the Planet Fitness brand and our judgement-free philosophy to over a billion TV viewers annually at a key time of year when health and wellness is top of mind for consumers.
Judgement Free Generation 
The Judgement Free Generation is Planet Fitness’ philanthropic initiative designed to combat the judgement and bullying faced by today’s youth by creating a culture of kindness and encouragement. With our Judgement Free Zone principle as a solid foundation, The Judgement Free Generation aims to empower a generation to grow up contributing to a more judgement free planet— a place where everyone feels accepted and like they belong.
We have partnered with Boys & Girls Clubs of America, PACER National Bullying Prevention Center and STOMP Out Bullying, to make a meaningful impact on the lives of today's youth. Together with our franchisees and vendors, Planet Fitness has donated approximately $4.5 million to support anti-bullying, pro-kindness initiatives.
Competition
In a broad sense, because many of our members are first-time or occasional gym users, we believe we compete with both fitness and non-fitness consumer discretionary spending alternatives for members’ and prospective members’ time and discretionary resources.
To a great extent, we also compete with other industry participants, including:
14


• | other fitness centers;


• | recreational facilities established by non-profit organizations such as YMCAs and by businesses for their employees;


• | private studios and other boutique fitness offerings;


• | racquet, tennis and other athletic clubs;


• | amenity and condominium/apartment clubs;


• | country clubs;


• | online personal training and fitness coaching;


• | the home-use fitness equipment industry;


• | local tanning salons; and


• | businesses offering similar services.

The health club industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Some of our competitors have name recognition in their respective countries or an established presence in local markets, and some are established in markets in which we have existing stores or intend to locate new stores. These risks are more significant internationally, where we have a limited number of stores and limited brand recognition.
We compete primarily based upon the membership value proposition we are able to offer due to our significant economies of scale, high-quality fitness experience, judgement-free atmosphere and superior customer service, all at an attractive value, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors.
Our competition continues to increase as we continue to expand into new markets and add stores in existing markets. See also “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and industry—The high level of competition in the health and fitness industry could materially and adversely affect our business.”
Suppliers
Franchisees are required to purchase fitness equipment from us (or our required vendors in the case of franchisees located in international markets) and are required to purchase various other items from vendors that we approve. We sell equipment purchased from third-party equipment manufacturers to franchise stores in the U.S. We also have one approved supplier of tanning beds, one approved supplier of massage beds and chairs, and various approved suppliers of non-fitness equipment and miscellaneous items. These vendors arrange for delivery of products and services directly to franchise stores. From time to time, we re-evaluate our supply relationships to ensure we obtain competitive pricing and high-quality equipment and other items.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 1,052 employees at our corporate-owned stores and 250 employees at our corporate headquarters located at 4 Liberty Lane West, Hampton, New Hampshire. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees.
Planet Fitness franchises are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of our franchisees are not employees of the Company.
Information technology and systems
All stores use a computerized, third-party hosted store management system to process new in-store memberships, bill members, update member information, check-in members, process point of sale transactions as well as track and analyze sales, membership statistics, cross-store utilization, member tenure, amenity usage, billing performance and demographic profiles by member. Our websites are hosted by third parties, and we also rely on third-party vendors for related functions such as our system for processing and integrating new online memberships, updating member information and making online payments. We believe these systems are scalable to support our growth plans.
Our back-office computer systems are comprised of a variety of technologies designed to assist in the management and analysis of our revenues, costs and key operational metrics as well as support the daily operations of our headquarters. These include third-party hosted systems that support our real estate and construction processes, a third-party hosted financial system, a third-party hosted data warehouse and business intelligence system to consolidate multiple data sources for reporting, advanced analysis, and 
15

financial analysis and forecasting, a third-party hosted payroll system, on premise telephony systems and a third-party hosted call center software solution to manage and track member-related requests.
We also provide our franchisees access to a web-based, third-party hosted custom franchise management system to receive informational notices, operational resources and updates, training materials and other franchisee communications. In 2018 we continued our multi-phased project that we started in 2015 to replace our existing franchise management system and consolidate several back-office systems, onto a third-party hosted platform to drive greater cross-system integration and efficiency and provide a scalable platform to support our growth plans. We expect to continue investing resources in 2019 through smaller, focused projects for our franchise management system to support the changing needs of our business.
In 2018, we engaged with a third-party software development vendor to develop a new, custom digital platform, which, through the exchange of data and introduction of digital products and services, facilitates digital experiences across any digital channel, including mobile, online, and in-store media. This platform is hosted by third parties and we rely on third-party vendors to maintain the platform and develop new digital capabilities. This solution will increasingly enable our ability to provide differentiated and unique experiences to our customers, allow for various partnership types and is aligned with our ongoing business strategy.
We recognize the value of enhancing and extending the uses of information technology in virtually every area of our business. Our information technology strategy is aligned to support our business strategy and operating plans. We maintain an ongoing comprehensive multi-year program to replace or upgrade key systems, enhance security and optimize their performance.
Intellectual property
We own many registered trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries, including “Planet Fitness,” “Judgement Free Zone,” “PE@PF,” “No Lunks,” “PF Black Card,” “No Gymtimidation,” “You Belong,” “Judgement Free Generation” and various other marks. We believe the Planet Fitness name and the many distinctive marks associated with it are of significant value and are very important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we pursue registration of our marks in select international jurisdictions, monitor the use of our marks in the U.S. and internationally and challenge any unauthorized use of the marks.
We license the use of our marks to franchisees, third-party vendors and others through franchise agreements, vendor agreements and licensing agreements. These agreements typically restrict third parties’ activities with respect to use of the marks and impose brand standards requirements. We require licensees to inform us of any potential infringement of the marks.
We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business.
We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our stores but such licenses are not material to our business.
Government regulation
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, international, state, provincial and local laws and regulations affecting our business.
We are subject to the FTC Franchise Rule promulgated by the FTC that regulates the offer and sale of franchises in the U.S. and its territories (including Puerto Rico) and requires us to provide to all prospective franchisees certain mandatory disclosure in a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”). In addition, we are subject to state franchise registration and disclosure laws in approximately 14 states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us, unless otherwise exempt, to register our franchise offering in those states prior to our making any offer or sale of a franchise in those states and to provide a FDD to prospective franchisees in accordance with such laws.
We are subject to franchise registration and disclosure laws in six provinces in Canada that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us, unless otherwise exempt, to register our franchise offering in those provinces in a prescribed format to prospective franchisees in accordance with such laws, and that regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship. We are also subject to franchise relationship laws in approximately 20 states that regulate many aspects of the franchise relationship including, depending upon the state, renewals and terminations of franchise agreements, franchise transfers, the applicable law and venue in which franchise disputes may be resolved, discrimination, and franchisees’ rights to associate, among others. In addition, we and our franchisees may also be subject to laws in other foreign countries where we or they do business.
We and our franchisees are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, similar state laws in certain jurisdictions, and various other U.S. and international laws governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions. Based on our experience with hiring employees and operating stores, we believe a significant number 
16

of our and our franchisees’ employees are paid at rates related to the U.S. federal or state minimum wage, and past increases in the U.S. federal and/or state minimum wage have increased labor costs, as would future increases.
Our and our franchisees’ operations and properties are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state, as well as international, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, building and zoning requirements. Our and our franchisees’ development of properties depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.
We and our franchisees are responsible at each of our respective locations for compliance with U.S. state laws, Canadian provincial laws and other international local laws that regulate the relationship between health clubs and their members. Nearly all states and provinces have consumer protection regulations that limit the collection of monthly membership dues prior to opening, require certain disclosures of pricing information, mandate the maximum length of contracts and “cooling off” periods for members (after the purchase of a membership), set escrow and bond requirements for health clubs, govern member rights in the event of a member relocation or disability, provide for specific member rights when a health club closes or relocates, or preclude automatic membership renewals.
We and our franchisees primarily accept payments for our memberships through EFTs from members’ bank accounts, and, therefore, we and our franchisees are subject to federal, state and international laws legislation and certification requirements, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Some states and provinces have passed or have considered legislation requiring gyms and health clubs to offer a prepaid membership option at all times and/or limit the duration for which memberships can auto-renew through EFT payments, if at all. Our business relies heavily on the fact that our memberships continue on a month-to-month basis after the completion of any initial term requirements, and compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. States that have such health club statutes provide harsh penalties for violations, including membership contracts being void or voidable.
Additionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of personally identifiable data by our, or our franchisees’, businesses are regulated at the federal, state and international levels as well as by certain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry, Security Standards Council, the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”) and the Canadian Payments Association. Federal, state, international and financial industry groups may also consider from time to time new privacy and security requirements that may apply to our businesses and may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure, use, and disposal of personally identifiable information that are housed in one or more of our databases.  These security requirements and further restrictions, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), grant protections and causes of action related to consumer data privacy and the methods in which it is collected, stored, used, and disposed by us, our franchisees, and applicable third parties. 
Many of the states and provinces where we and our franchisees operate stores have health and safety regulations that apply to health clubs and other facilities that offer indoor tanning services. In addition, U.S. federal law imposes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services. Under the rule promulgated by the IRS imposing the tax, a portion of the cost of memberships that include access to our tanning services are subject to the tax.
Our organizational structure
Planet Fitness, Inc. is a holding company, and its principal asset is an equity interest in the membership units (“Holdings Units”) in Pla-Fit Holdings, LLC (“Pla-Fit Holdings”).
We are the sole managing member of Pla-Fit Holdings. We operate and control all of the business and affairs of Pla-Fit Holdings, and we hold 100% of the voting interest in Pla-Fit Holdings. As a result, we consolidate Pla-Fit Holdings’ financial results and report a non-controlling interest related to the Holdings Units not owned by us. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information.
