ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Business development
 
Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. (the “Company”, “we” or “Liberty Star”) was formerly Liberty Star Gold Corp. and formerly Titanium Intelligence, Inc. (“Titanium”). Titanium was incorporated on August 20, 2001 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On February 5, 2004, we commenced operations in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business. In April 2007, we changed our name to Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. Hay Mountain Super Project LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, serves as the primary holding company for development of the potential ore bodies encompassed in the Hay Mountain area of interest in Arizona. Prior to 2017 Big Chunk Corp. (“Big Chunk”), our wholly owned subsidiary, was engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business in the State of Alaska. We are in the exploration phase of operations and have not generated any revenues from operations.
 
Our current business
 
We are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in the States of Arizona and the Southwest USA. Claims in the State of Arizona are held in the name of Liberty Star. Our significant projects are described below.
 
North Pipes Super Project (“North Pipes” and “NPSP”): The NPSP is located in Northern Arizona on the Arizona Strip. After much consideration we determined not to retain North Pipes Super Project claims. We have not identified any ore reserves to date. We may revisit NPSP in the future depending on moratorium changes.
 
Tombstone Mining District (“Tombstone”) (formerly referred to as Tombstone Super Project): Tombstone is located in Cochise County, Arizona and covers the Tombstone caldera and its environs. The Hay Mountain target is located in the Tombstone caldera where we continue to focus our work. We plan to ascertain whether the Tombstone, Hay Mountain claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper, molybdenum, gold, silver, lead, zinc, manganese and other metals including Rare Earth Elements (REE’s). We have not identified any ore reserves to date.
 
East Silver Bell Porphyry Copper Project (“East Silver Bell”): East Silver Bell is located northwest of Tucson, Arizona. East Silver Bell was under option to the Company from JABA (US) Inc. We have decided to not renew that option in 2019.
 
Title to mineral claims involves certain inherent risks due to difficulties in determining the validity of certain claims, as well as potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral properties. We have investigated title to all the Company’s mineral properties and, to the best of its knowledge, title to all properties retained are in good standing.
 
The mineral resource business generally consists of three stages: exploration, development and production. Mineral resource companies that are in the exploration stage have not yet found mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities and are engaged in exploring land in an effort to discover them. Mineral resource companies that have located a mineral resource in commercially exploitable quantities and are preparing to extract that resource are in the development stage, while those engaged in the extraction of a known mineral resource are in the production stage. We have not found any mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities.

There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties, and further exploration is required before we can evaluate whether any exist and, if so, whether it would be economically feasible to develop or exploit those resources. Even if we complete our current exploration program and we are successful in identifying a mineral deposit, we would be required to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we could know whether that mineral deposit will constitute a commercially viable mineral deposit, known as an “ore reserve.”
 
To date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to pursue our business plan and generate revenues is subject to our ability to obtain additional financing, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to do so.
 
Competition
 
We are a mineral resource company engaged in the business of mineral exploration. We compete with other mineral resource exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in mineral resource exploration companies. The presence of competing mineral resource exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our property acquisitions and exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors.
 
We also compete for mineral properties of merit with other exploration companies. Competition could reduce the availability of properties of merit or increase the cost of acquiring additional mineral properties.
 
Many of the resource exploration companies with whom we compete may have greater financial and technical resources than we have. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of properties of merit and on exploration of their properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of resource properties. This competition could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and to senior exploration companies that may purchase resource properties or enter into joint venture agreements with junior exploration companies. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance property acquisitions and further exploration.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of Arizona and all other States in which we plan to operate.
 
The North Pipes claims were federal lode mining claims located on U.S. federal lands and administered by the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”). In 2012, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior withdrew federal lands from locatable mineral exploration and mining North of the Grand Canyon along the Utah border in Arizona, the so-called “Arizona Strip,” for 20 years. Nearly 1 million acres of land managed by the BLM and the Forest Service are subject to the moratorium.
 
On September 1, 2018 we determined after much consideration not to retain the North Pipes claims. Moratorium restraints for land at NPSP was largely involved in our decision.
 
We are required to pay annual rentals for our federal lode mining claims for our East Silverbell project in the State of Arizona. The rental period begins at noon on September 1st through the following September 1st and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. The annual rental is $155 per claim. The rental of $155.00 for the period from September 1, 2018 to September 1, 2019 have been paid. The annual rentals due by September 1, 2019 of $155.00 are required to maintain the East Silverbell claim for the period from September 1, 2019 through September 1, 2020 will not be paid because we decided not to renew the JABA (US) Inc. option in 2019. . There is no requirement for annual assessment or exploration work on the federal lode mining claims. There are no royalties associated with the federal lode mining claims.

We are required to pay annual rentals for our federal lode mining claims for the Tombstone project in the State of Arizona. The rental period begins at noon on September 1st through the following September 1st and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. The annual rentals are $155 per claim. The rentals due by September 1, 2019 for the period from September 1, 2019 through September 1, 2020 of $10,230 have not been paid yet, however, we plan to pay these fees prior to the due date. All rentals due in 2018 have been paid.
 
We are required to pay annual rentals for our Arizona State Land Department Mineral Exploration Permits (“AZ MEP”) at our Tombstone Hay Mountain project in the State of Arizona. AZ MEP permits cost $500 per permit per year in non-refundable filing fees and are valid for 1 year and renewable for up to 5 years. The rental fee is $2.00 per acre for the first year, which includes the second year, and $1.00 per acre per year for years three through five. The minimum work expenditure requirements are $10 per acre per year for years one and two and $20 per acre per year for years three through five. If the minimum work expenditure requirement is not met the applicant can pay the equal amount in fees to the Arizona State Land Department to keep the AZ MEP permits current. The rental period begins on the date of acceptance for each permit. Rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. We hold AZ MEP permits for 6,639.95 acres at our Tombstone project. We plan to pay filing and rental fees for our AZ MEP’s before their respective due dates in the amount of $15,926.88. Required minimum work expenditures will be $66,400 which is due during Fiscal Year ending 1.31.2020. All fees and work expenditures due in 2018 have been paid.
 
With respect to the foregoing properties, additional approvals and authorizations may be required from other government agencies, depending upon the nature and scope of the proposed exploration program. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the size, quality of any resource or reserve at this time, and it is extremely difficult to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings or our competitive position.
 
Personnel
 
Prior to December 7, 2018 we employed one full time geologist who was also our CEO, CFO, President and Chairman of the Board. On December 7, 2018 the Board voted to change our management structure by electing Brett Gross as President and CEO, & Pete O’Heeron as Chairman of the Board. We also employ one full time VP Finance who was elected by the Board of Directors to CFO January 11, 2019, one full time geo-tech, who is also our Manager of Field Operations, one Investor Relations Representative and one CPA on an as needed basis. We hire consultants for investor relations, exploration, derivative accounting, and administrative functions also on an as needed basis.
