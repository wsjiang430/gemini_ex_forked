  ITEM 1.     
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

 
  Our Company
  
 cbdMD was originally founded in 2015 as an innovative branding and marketing company with a focus on lifestyle-based brands. In December 2018 pursuant to a two-step merger (the “Mergers”), we acquired Cure Based Development LLC ("Cure Based Development”) following the passage of the United States Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, commonly known as the “Farm Bill”, which contained a permanent declassification of cannabidiol (CBD) as a controlled substance under federal law. As a result of that transaction, we own and operate the nationally recognized CBD brand cbdMD which now represents our focus and substantially all of our revenues.
  
 
 Through our CBDI subsidiary which succeeded to the business of Cure Based Development, we produce and distribute various high-grade, premium CBD products, including tinctures, capsules, gummies, bath bombs and topical creams. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we launched a line of pet related CBD products under our Paw CBD brand which includes tinctures, treats, and balms, with additional products under development. In October 2019, following the initial positive response to the Paw CBD brand from retailers and consumers, we organized Paw CBD as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary in an effort to take advantage of its early mover status in the CBD animal health industry. With over 40 SKU’s of premium pet CBD products for dogs, cats and horses, we are seeking to grow Paw CBD into a leading brand. We also anticipate that Paw CBD will also partner with existing pet brands seeking to leverage our experience in sales, marketing and distribution in the CBD industry.
  
 We either manufacture our premium line of products at our Charlotte, NC facility or work with third party manufacturers.  We only source cannabinoids, including CBD, which are extracted from non-GMO hemp grown on farms in the United States.  We utilize a manufacturing process which creates hybrid broad-spectrum concentrations including CBD, other cannabinoids, and various other compounds, which we believe creates a superior product, while eliminating tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content.

 Since December 2018, we have significantly increased the number of locations cbdMD products are available in, and with the building momentum of retailer acceptance subsequent to the passage of the Farm Bill, we are pursuing multiple opportunities to expand our product distribution as we continue to work to build cbdMD into a top recognized brand in the industry. We are also utilizing partnerships and sponsorships with professional athletes as a way to gain brand recognition. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we signed several significant sponsorships, including, but not limited to, professional golfer and 12-time PGA Tour winner Bubba Watson, Ice Cube’s Big 3 basketball league, Bellator MMA, and Nitro Circus.
  
 
 
  Discontinued operations
  
 Historically our operations included our BPU, EE1, IM1 and Level H&W subsidiaries. These subsidiaries accounted for our licensing, entertainment, and products segments prior to fiscal 2019. As revenues from the operations of these subsidiaries continued to decline in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 levels, and the revenues associated with CBDI began to represent substantially all of our revenues, effective September 30, 2019, we discontinued operations of EE1, IM1, BPU and Level H&W. The decision to exit these businesses has resulted in these businesses being accounted for as discontinued operations in our audited consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report. Continuing operations discussed below, now reported as one segment, refer to our CBD business unless otherwise indicated, and prior periods in such discussion have been restated to reflect results excluding EE1, IM1, BPU and Level H&W. See Note 15, “Discontinued Operations”, of the Notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional disclosures related to the reclassification of prior period amounts related to discontinued operations to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.

  Growth Strategies and Outlook
  
 With the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018, which removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, making it no longer an illegal substance under federal law, an opportunity to strategically position the Company in an emerging market was presented. With the acquisition of Cure Based Development described later in this report, we believe we have established a solid foundation which will allow us to significantly grow the Company and become a leader in a new market.
  
 We are pursuing the following strategies to continue to grow our revenues and expand our business and operations in fiscal 2020 and beyond:
  
  ●
  Increase our base of product offerings: We currently have a broad offering of CBD products, including topicals, tinctures, gummies, bath bombs, vape oils, capsules, and pet products and continue to evaluate additional offerings within these categories as well as new ways to provide CBD in a manner that meets consumer demands. To that end we are devoting resources to ongoing research and development processes with the goal of expanding our product offerings to meet these expanding consumer demands;


  ●
  Expand our sales channels: As the market continues to evolve, we are expanding our sales channels. During fiscal 2019, we moved from a 100% online sales channel to working with wholesalers and retail channels. Big box retailers are beginning to explore CBD products and we believe this will provide another significant opportunity. In addition, sales channels for the pet line include expanding to not only retail stores but veterinary and pet care operations;


  ●
  Expand our recently formed CBD animal health division: With the formation in October 2019 of Paw CBD as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary, we have committed resources to branding and marketing the Paw CBD product line, which we believe will enable us to more effectively target new sales channels as well as utilize our marketing efforts in a more defined manner that we believe will generate other sales opportunities;


  ●
  Expand our sponsorships toward targeted segments: We have had significant success with attracting high profile sponsors and influencers and expect to continue to assess the segments we have covered as well as additional sponsors for segments we do not cover but we believe could provide opportunity for growth; and


  ●
  Acquisitions. We may also choose to further build and maintain our brand portfolio by acquiring additional brands directly or through joint ventures if opportunities arise that we believe are in our best interests. As we are in an emerging market, opportunities could be present as companies establish strong brands and begin to obtain large market share. In assessing potential acquisitions or investments, we expect to utilize our internal resources to primarily evaluate growth potential, the strength of the target brand, offerings of the target, as well as possible efficiencies to gain. We believe that this approach will allow us to effectively screen consumer brand candidates and strategically evaluate acquisition targets and efficiently complete due diligence for potential acquisitions. We are not a party, however at this time, to any agreements or understandings regarding the acquisition of additional brands or companies and there are no assurances we will be successful in expanding our brand portfolio.

 cbdMD’s website provides up-to-date information about CBD quality and current industry events, as well as U.S. based customer service. We test our hybrid broad-spectrum CBD extractions through independent, third-party laboratories in an effort to achieve the highest of standards and we offer a 30-day, money-back guarantee. Our products are available online at www.cbdMD.com and over 4,000 non-affiliated stores.
  
  Sales and marketing
  
 Our business model is designed first and foremost to build a strong brand as quickly as possible as we operate in an emerging market. As CBD is a new market, we believe the cost to acquire customers is most likely at the lowest point it will be, therefore, as part of our overall strategy we started with an internet and online marketing strategy and are investing heavily in brand promotion and customer acquisition. In addition, we have been executing on our strategy to build and now expand our wholesale distribution channel as part of the overall business model.
  
 Sales of our products mainly come from online sales at our website www.cbdmd.com and through our inside sales department which concentrates on wholesale distributors, who we believe can offer large quantities of cbdMD products at physical retail locations. cbdMD utilizes a broad-based marketing strategy across multiple platforms including:
  
  ●
  secured online and print advertising;

  ●
  blog, web, and visual content;

  ●
  social media engagement through accounts with large followings;

  ●
  live and sponsored events;

  ●
  influencers and celebrities;

  ●
  affiliate marketing; and

  ●
  high-quality brand apparel.

 
  Product manufacturing and distribution
 
 We either manufacture our premium line of products at our Charlotte, NC facility or work with third party manufacturers.  We only source cannabinoids, including CBD, which are extracted from non-GMO hemp grown on farms in the United States.  We utilize a manufacturing process which creates hybrid broad-spectrum concentrations including CBD, other cannabinoids, and various other compounds, which we believe creates a superior product while eliminating tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content.
  
 We currently hold short term supply contracts with preferred vendors for our critical raw materials.  We have first rights of refusal on purchases so that we can ensure the availability of such materials as needed.  Our preferred vendors are extractors and brokers who have access to the sources of the critical raw materials on the spot buy market to meet our growing demands for raw materials.
  
 We distribute our products both through our online sales channel as well as through a number of wholesalers and retailers that resell our products both in brick and mortar locations as well as via their online websites. 
  
  Research and development
  
 The key objectives and input points that drive cbdMD’s research and development process include current product and new product development activities:
  
 Our current product improvement efforts include:
  
  ●
  consumer feedback analysis;

  ●
  optimization of its product manufacturing process;

  ●
  sourcing of reliable, high-quality raw materials while maintaining strong distributor relationships;

  ●
  lab testing; and

  ●
  feedback from panels of product testers.

 Our new product development efforts are focused on both near-term and long-term results for the company:
  
 With a view toward near-term results, our efforts include:
  
  ●
  in-depth market research on current competitor campaigns;

  ●
  website and product development;

  ●
  sample size testing and research;

  ●
  implementation of new product campaigns utilizing social media, digital, affiliate and email;

  ●
  rapid product development following testing; and

  ●
  quality ingredient sourcing.

 
 With a view towards long-term results, our efforts include:
  
  ●
  development of new product lines following initial market research;

  ●
  use of current and expected future product trends and research to develop new product offerings;

  ●
  refinement of extraction and production methods for product efficiency;

  ●
  ingredient research through sustainability testing;

  ●
  manufacturing process optimization;

  ●
  in-depth product testing;

  ●
  package and graphic development; and

  ●
  large scale product and brand marketing campaigns.

 
 In fiscal 2019 we introduced CBD PM and a pet line branded under Paw cbd with over 40 SKU’s.
  
  Intellectual property
  
 We currently hold fourteen U.S. trademark applications which are held for current and future product offerings and extended branding capability, which are set forth below:

 In addition to these trademarks, we currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our product development, formulation and knowhow, as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our formulas and other proprietary information.

 In addition to www.cbdmd.com and www.pawcbd.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.
  
  Competition
  
 The market for the sale of CBD-based products is fragmented and intensely competitive. Currently, in the United States, cbdMD does not believe that there are any businesses that can demonstrate or claim a dominant market share of the growing CBD products market. Our competitors in the retail location sales of CBD-based products include Green Roads, PlusCBD, and Select CBD, and in the digital space include Diamond CBD, CBDistillery, and Lazarus Naturals. We believe we compete based upon the quality of our products. We expect that the quantity and composition of the competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures and new customers enter the marketplace.
  
  Government regulations
  
 On December 20, 2018 the President of the United States signed the Farm Bill into law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes include removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it is no longer an illegal substance under federal law. For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been legalized at the federal level and this paved the way for the growth of the industry.  With the recent publication of the USDA interim final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program on October 31, 2019, hemp can now be grown and processed legally in the United States, and is legal to transport in interstate commerce. Although this interim final rule became effective on the date of publication, it is still subject to comment and there is a possibility it will be modified from its current application.
  
 The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. drug laws.  The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp based products or accept the USDA rules.  Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp (other than THC) are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations.  We are actively monitoring the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant.
  
 In conjunction with the enactment of the Farm Bill, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) released a statement about the status of CBD and the agency’s actions in the short term with regards to CBD will guide the industry.  The statement noted that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Farm Bill.
  
 Recently, both the U.S. House of Representatives (McNerney CA-09) and the Senate (McConnell R-KY) have passed amendments to the respective appropriations bills working their way through each chamber, which would help clear the way for cannabidiol (CBD) to become an approved dietary ingredient by the FDA through an alternative rule making process available to the FDA.  Although it is uncertain if either of these amendments will make it to the final federal appropriation bill, or if the President will ultimately sign the appropriations bill, this signifies the legislatures clear intent to pave a pathway for clear and consistent federal regulation for cannabidiol. 
  
   
10


  
 
 As of the date of this report, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies. The FDA, however, has sent warning letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products, only relating to instances that such CBD companies have made misleading and unapproved label claims.  We will continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD.
  
 As a consumer goods manufacturer, we strive to meet or exceed the FDAs Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. With our growth and evolution, challenges could exist and we must continue to review processes and controls and adapt our day to day GMP policies and practices as our manufacturing volume increases.  We are dedicated to providing the highest quality CBD consumer goods on the market and therefore will continue to focus substantial efforts on GMP compliance. We are currently undergoing third party audit and consulting to ensure we are using best practices and we intend to seek multiple third party certifications possibly as early as the second quarter of 2020 from NSF and the U.S. Hemp Authority.  Additionally, we have secured third party contract manufacturing from an FDA registered facility which is GMP certified and subject to continuing independent audit and certification, to handle our increased manufacturing needs.  
  
 We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
  
 There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.
  
  Employees
  
 At December 01, 2019 we had 182 full-time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.
  
  Our history
  
 Our company was formed under the laws of the state of North Carolina in March 2015 under the name Level Beauty Group, Inc. In November 2016 we changed the name of our parent company to Level Brands, Inc. In December 2016 we effected a 1:5 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. In December 2018, we completed the Mergers of Cure Based Development into our newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary cbdMD LLC. As part of the overall business strategy, in April 2019 we renamed cbdMD LLC to CBD Industries LLC and renamed Level Brands, Inc. to cbdMD, Inc. In October 2019 we formed a wholly owned subsidiary Paw CBD, Inc. which will operate the CBD pet line.
  
 Additional information on the terms of material acquisitions may be found in Note 2 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.
  
  Additional information
  
 We file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or the “Commission”). The Commission also maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the Commission.

  ITEM 1.A      
 RISK FACTORS.

 
  Investing in our securities involves risks. In addition to the other information contained in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks before deciding to purchase our securities. The occurrence of any of the following risks might cause you to lose all or a part of your investment. Some statements in this report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for more information regarding forward-looking statements.
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS
  
  We have a history of losses and there are no assurances we will report profitable operations in future periods.
  
 We reported net losses to common shareholders of $50,428,226 and $412,075 for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Included in our net loss for fiscal 2019 is $5,993,773 associated with losses from our discontinued operations, and an expense reflecting an increase of $32,461,680 in the non-cash contingent liability associated with the Earnout Shares (as hereinafter defined) primarily as a result of the change in the market price of our common stock . Until such time, if ever, that we are successful in generating profits which are sufficient to pay our operating expenses it is likely we will continue to report losses in future periods. There are no assurances we will generate substantial revenues from the new businesses or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to report profitable operations or a net profit.
  
  We have a limited operating history in a new market segment that could impede our ability to achieve our goals for future performance and brand strategy.
  
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBDI, succeeded to the operations of Cure Based Development following the closing of the Mergers in December 2018. We formed this subsidiary in connection with the Mergers and it had no operating history prior to the Mergers. Cure Based Development was formed in 2017 and did not begin reporting any meaningful revenues until mid-2018. We are operating in a market segment that has experienced significant growth and competition since the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018. We are experiencing all of the challenges of a company with a limited operating history in its current business seeking to effectively develop a brand in a market segment with growing competition. These challenges make it difficult for investors to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on estimates of our future performance. To address these risks and uncertainties, we must do the following:
  
  ●
  successfully execute our business strategy to offer the highest quality CBD in the industry;

  ●
  introduce new, differentiated botanical products;

  ●
  respond to competitive business developments;

  ●
  effectively and efficiently market and sell our line of CBD products;

  ●
  improve the distribution of our CBD products; and

  ●
  attract, integrate, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

  
 During fiscal 2019 we spent approximately $7,831,000 on brand development and marketing. In order to continue to develop brand recognition and grow our sales, we will need to continue to invest in our brand development and marketing strategies which will require us to raise additional capital. Even with our focus on brand development in an effort to increase our sales, our business strategy may not be successful and we may not successfully address these risks. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
  
   
12


  
 
  The impact of changes in the fair value of our contingent liabilities associated with the Earnout Shares may materially impact our results of operations in future periods.
  
 As consideration for the Mergers, we had a contractual obligation, after approval by our shareholders, to issue 15,250,000 shares of our common stock (the “Initial Shares”) to the members of Cure Based Development of which 8,750,000 of the shares will vest over a five year period and are subject to a voting proxy agreement, as well as to issue another 15,250,000 shares of our common stock (the “Earnout Shares”) in the future upon earnout goals being met within the next five years. Our shareholders approved the issuance of the both the Initial Shares and the Earnout Shares at our 2019 annual shareholder meeting and the Initial Shares were issued to members of Cure Based Development on April 19, 2019. Under US GAAP we were required to record a non-cash contingent liability associated with both the Initial Shares and the Earnout Shares. As of September 30, 2019, the Initial Shares have been issued and have been reclassified from contingent liability to additional paid in capital. At September 30, 2019, the total of this contingent liability was $32,461,680 and is reflective of the Earnout Shares. We are obligated to reassess the obligations associated with the Earnout Shares and, in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes, we will record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to earnings, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, our shareholders’ equity and the market price of our securities. In particular, changes in the market price of our common stock, which is one of the inputs used in determining the amount of the non-cash contingent liability, will result in increases or decreases in this liability and positively or negatively impact our net loss or profit for the period. Investors should not place undue reliance on the impact of these non-cash changes when evaluating our results of operations in future periods, as they have no impact on the operations of the business.
  
  We may require additional capital to finance operations or the acquisition of additional brands, and if we are unable to raise such capital on beneficial terms this could restrict our growth.
  
 We may, in the future, require additional capital to help fund all or part of our operation or for potential acquisitions. If, at the time required, we do not have sufficient cash to finance those additional capital needs, we will need to raise additional funds through equity and/or debt financing. We cannot guarantee that, if and when needed, additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Further, if additional capital is needed and is either unavailable or cost prohibitive, our growth may be limited as we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of our expansion plans. In addition, any additional financing we undertake could impose additional covenants upon us that restrict our operating flexibility, and, if we issue equity securities to raise capital or as acquisition consideration, our existing shareholders may experience dilution or the new securities may have rights senior to those of our 8% Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Convertible Preferred Stock”), assuming the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock approve the issuance of such senior securities.
  
  The issuances of the Earnout Shares to the Cure Based Development members will significantly dilute our existing shareholders.
  
 Upon the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, on the closing date the members of Cure Based Development received the right to receive 15,250,000 Initial Shares, representing approximately 60% of our outstanding common stock following such issuance at the time, as the consideration for the Mergers. The Merger Agreement also provides that we may issue up to an additional 15,250,000 Earnout Shares as part of the Mergers consideration upon the satisfaction of certain aggregate net revenue criteria by cbdMD within 60 months following the closing date. As of December 1, 2019, there were 27,720,356 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, which includes the 15,250,000 Initial Shares which were issued in April 2019. Assuming the possible issuance of an additional 15,250,000 Earnout Shares, but giving effect to no other change to the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, the members of Cure Based Development, which includes Mr. R. Scott Coffman, our co-CEO and member of our board of directors, would own approximately 64% of our then outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, the ownership and voting rights of our existing shareholders will be proportionally reduced.
  
   
13


  
 
  We may be unable to liquidate securities we accept as partial compensation under consulting agreements which could adversely impact our liquidity in future periods.
  
 Our ability to sell any securities we had accepted as partial compensation under consulting agreements is dependent upon a number of factors, including the existence of a liquid market for the securities and our compliance with the resale provisions of federal securities laws which require us to hold the shares for at least six months, among other factors. If we accept securities, we expect to generally accept securities from issuers who are publicly traded or who are expecting to become a publicly traded company. There are no assurances a liquid market will exist in such securities at such time as we are able to resell the shares, or that the price we may receive will be commensurate with the value of the services we are providing. In that event, we would not benefit from the expected rise in the market price of the securities we own as a result of our efforts on behalf of the client company. In addition, depending upon the terms of our business relationship with the issuer of the securities, it is possible that from time to time we could be in possession of non-public information regarding the issuer which could prohibit us from disposing of the shares at a time when it is advantageous to us to do so. If we are unable to readily liquidate any securities we accept as compensation, we could be deprived of the cash value of those services and we would be required to write-off the carrying value of the securities which could adversely impact our results of operations in future periods.
  
  We rely on third-parties to manufacture and to compound some of our products, we have no control over these manufactures and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.
  
 Some of our products are manufactured or compounded by unaffiliated third parties. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of these third parties, and we expect to compete with other companies for raw materials, production and import capacity. If we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any manufacturer or compounder would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to engage third parties. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the manufacturing or compounding of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term.
  
  We face risks associated with the manufacture of our products which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
  
 We are subject to the risks inherent in manufacturing our products, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control. If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
  
  We could experience losses related to undisclosed liabilities of EE1 and I’M1.
  
 Effective September 30, 2019 we discontinued the operations of EE1 and I’M1.  In November 2019 we entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement with the minority holders of EE1 and I’M1 and other related parties.  The terms of this agreement provided, in part, that the parties agreed to transfer the accounts receivable of EE1 and the minority interest of both EE1 and IM1 to us and we agreed to have all rights to certain past contracts or customers for those entities assigned to the minority holders.  As a result, we are now the sole member of these entities.  While the Settlement and Release Agreement contains an indemnification provision, if we should discover in the future that there are undisclosed liabilities in one or both of these entities, we could be liable for the payment of these undisclosed liabilities, which could be material , until such time, if ever, that we were able to recoup any such amounts from the indemnifying parties.

  Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment
  
  Changes to state laws pertaining to industrial hemp could slow the use of industrial hemp which would materially impact our revenues in future periods.
  
 As of the date hereof, approximately 40 states authorized industrial hemp programs pursuant to the Farm Bill. Continued development of the industrial hemp industry will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of industrial hemp at the state level, and further amendment or supplementation of legislation at the federal level. Any number of events or occurrences could slow or halt progress all together in this space. While progress within the industrial hemp industry is currently encouraging, growth is not assured. While there appears to be ample public support for favorable legislative action, numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the legislative process(es) within the various states where we have business interests. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of industrial hemp, which could negatively impact the business up to possibly causing us to discontinue operations as a whole.
  
  Costs associated with compliance with numerous laws and regulations could impact our financial results. In addition, we could become subject to increased litigation risks associated with the CBD industry.
  
 The manufacture, labeling and distribution by us of the CBD products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability to sell products in the future. The FDA may regulate our products to ensure that the products are not adulterated or misbranded. We are subject to regulation by the federal government andother state and local agencies as a result of our CBD products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to our company, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect the ability to operate our business and our financial results. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. Our advertising is subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labeling laws to be enforced by attorneys general who may seek relief for consumers, seek class-action certifications, seek class-wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. For example, in November 2019 the FDA issued warning letters to 15 companies for illegally selling products containing CBD in ways that violate the FD&C Act. Notwithstanding that we were not a recipient of a warning letter, and we believe our products are properly labeled as required under federal law, cbdMD, along with other of our competitors who also did not receive FDA warning letters, have been named in a class action lawsuit which we believe is without merit. Any actions against our company by governmental authorities or private litigants could be time consuming, costly to defend and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
  
  Uncertainty caused by potential changes to legal regulations could impact the use of CBD products.
  
 There is substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the scope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and/or the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processorsmay engage in interstate commerce. The uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps even state-level, legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. If these uncertainties continue, they may have an adverse effect upon the introduction of our products in different markets.

  RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES
  
  We are subject to the continued listing standards of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock.
  
 Both the shares of our common stock and our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain these listings, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders’ equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer (i) if, in its opinion, the issuer’s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; (ii) if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; (iii) if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; (iv) if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American’s listing requirements; (v) if an issuer’s securities sell at what the NYSE American considers a “low selling price” and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or (vi) if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. If the NYSE American delists either our common stock and/or our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.
  
  The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and is effectively junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.
  
 In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue (subject to Series A Convertible Preferred Stockholder approval) that ranks senior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our existing subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and any future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.
  
  Future offerings of debt may adversely affect the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
  
 If we decide to issue debt securities in the future, it is possible that these securities will be governed by an indenture or other instruments containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and may result in dilution to owners of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. We and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. The holders of our securities may bear the risk of our future offerings, potentially reducing the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and diluting the value of their holdings in us.
  
  We may not be able to pay dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
  
 Our ability to pay cash dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock requires us to (i) either be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or (ii) have total assets that are greater than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Further, notwithstanding these factors, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described in this report were to occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, including the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

  Market interest rates may materially and adversely affect the value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
  
 One of the factors that influences the price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is the dividend yield on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (as a percentage of the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock) relative to market interest rates. Continued increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to expect a higher dividend yield (and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for dividend payments). Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to materially decrease, assuming a market is established of which there are no assurances.
  
  Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income.”
  
 Distributions paid to corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income,” if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We do not currently have any accumulated earnings and profits. Additionally, we may not have sufficient current earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distributions fail to qualify as dividends, U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income.” If any distributions on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to any fiscal year are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction or preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income” because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that the market value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock might decline.
  
  The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents perpetual equity interests in us, and investors should not expect us to redeem or convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on the date the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock becomes redeemable or convertible by us or on any particular date afterwards.
  
 The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents perpetual equity interests in our Company, and it has no maturity or mandatory redemption except upon a Change of Control, and is not redeemable at the option of investors under any other circumstances. A “Change of Control” will generally be deemed to occur when, after the original issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a “person” under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions which were pre-approved by our board of directors of our stock entitling that person to exercise more than 50% of the total voting power of all of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of the our directors, subject to certain exclusions. As a result, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will not give rise to a claim for payment of any amount at a particular date. As a result, holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an indefinite period of time unless the holder chooses to voluntarily convert the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock.
  
  The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has not been rated.
  
 We have not sought to obtain a rating for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. However, one or more rating agencies may independently determine to issue such a rating or such a rating, if issued, may adversely affect the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, we may elect in the future to obtain a rating for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings and such ratings could be revised downward, placed on a watch list or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision, placing on a watch list or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

  Change of Control redemption obligations may make it more difficult for a party to acquire us or discourage a party from acquiring us.
  
 The Change of Control redemption feature of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our Company or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain of change of control transactions under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price of such stock or that shareholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.
  
  If our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is delisted, the ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be limited and the market value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will likely be materially adversely affected.
  
 The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock does not contain provisions that are intended to protect investors if our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is delisted from the NYSE American. If our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is delisted from the NYSE American, investors’ ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be limited and the market value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will likely be materially adversely affected. Moreover, since the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, absent a holder’s voluntary conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock investors may be forced to hold shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock indefinitely while receiving stated dividends thereon when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and paid by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation value thereof.
  
  A holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has extremely limited voting rights.
  
 The voting rights for a holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are limited. Our shares of common stock are the only class of our securities that carry full voting rights. Holders of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights other than as set forth below in the next two sentences or unless dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are in arrears for each of 12 or more consecutive monthly periods, in which case the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote as a separate class for the election of two additional directors to serve on the board of directors until all dividends that are owed have been paid. Holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a class, are also entitled to vote if we should seek to issue or create any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to dividends or distributions, in which event the consent of holders of at least two thirds of the then outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is required. The consent of the holders of a majority of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a class, is required if we were to seek to adopt any amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would materially affect existing terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or increase the number of authorized shares of that series, other than in connection with the anti-dilution provisions, or if we seek to create a series or class which ranks pari passu with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Other than these limited circumstances and except to the extent required by law, holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights.
  
  We may redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at our option, we will be required to redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control and we may convert shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon a Market Trigger into shares of our common stock. In the event of any of these occurrences, you may not receive dividends that you anticipate.
  
 On or after October 16, 2023 we may, at our option, redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. In addition, upon the occurrence of a board approved Change of Control, we are required to redeem any or all of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $11.00 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the redemption date. Furthermore, upon a Market Trigger (as that term is defined in the designations, rights and preferences of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock), we may convert all or any portion of those shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock. We may have an incentive to redeem or convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend rate on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If we redeem or convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, then from and after the redemption date or conversion date, as applicable, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights as a holder of those shares will terminate, including the rights to receive dividend payments.
  
   
18


  
 
  The liquidation preference of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would reduce the amount available to our common shareholders in the event of our liquidation or winding up.
  
 Holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have a liquidation preference of $10.00 per share in the event of our liquidation or winding up. This means that those holders are entitled to receive the liquidation preference before any payment or other distribution of assets to our common shareholders, and the amount of any such payment or other distribution will be reduced by that amount.
  
  The issuance of shares upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants, or the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.
  
 In addition to our obligation to issue the Earnout Shares if the goals are met, we presently have options and warrants that if exercised would result in the issuance of an additional 1,691,178 shares of our common stock, and our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is presently convertible into an additional 833,500 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares upon exercise of warrants and options and/or the conversion of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will result in dilution to the interests of other shareholders.

  The price of our securities may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
  
 Stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and/or our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its future volatility. Price declines in our securities could result from general market and economic conditions, some of which are beyond our control, and a variety of other factors, including any of the risk factors described in this report. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our securities, regardless of our operating performance, and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our securities since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our securities include the following:
  
  ●
   price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;

  ●
   changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other CBD product companies generally;

  ●
  prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock;

  ●
  the annual yield from distributions on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;

  ●
   sales of shares of our securities by us or our shareholders;

  ●
   failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

  ●
   the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;

  ●
   rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;

  ●
   actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;

  ●
   actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;

  ●
   litigation, including class action lawsuits, involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;

  ●
   developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;

  ●
   announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or brands by us or our competitors;

  ●
   new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;

  ●
   changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;

  ●
   any significant change in our management; and

  ●
   general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.

 
 In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.
  
   
20


  
 
  We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.
  
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to:
  
  ●
   being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure;


  ●
   not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;


  ●
   not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;


  ●
   reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and


  ●
   exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

 
 Investors may find our securities less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and/or our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the price of either or both of these securities may be more volatile.
 
  Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates may exert control over us and may exercise influence over matters subject to shareholder approval.
  
 Our executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock as of December 01, 2019. Accordingly, these shareholders, if they act together, may exercise substantial influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control over us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.
  
  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our securities share prices and trading volumes could decline.
  
 An active trading market for our securities will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We may be unable to attract or sustain coverage by well-regarded securities and industry analysts. If either none or only a limited number of securities or industry analysts cover us or our business, or if these securities or industry analysts are not widely respected within the general investment community, the trading price for our common stock and/or our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would be materially and negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us or our business downgrade our securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or our business, or fail to publish reports on us or our business regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price of our securities and trading volume to decline.
  
   
21


  
 
  Some provisions of our charter documents and North Carolina law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
  
 Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of North Carolina law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:
  
  ●
  permit our board of directors to issue up to 45,000,000 shares of preferred stock (net of the previous designation in October 2019 of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock), with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate;


  ●
  are part of the rights and preferences of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock;


  ●
  provide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; and


  ●
  do not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election.

 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, North Carolina has two primary anti-takeover statutes, the Shareholder Protection Act and the Control Share Acquisition Act, which govern the shareholder approval required for certain business combinations. As permitted by North Carolina law, we have opted out of both these provisions. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act or Control Share Acquisition Act. Any provision of our articles of incorporation, bylaws or North Carolina law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our shares of common stock.
  
  We have additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our securities.
 
 Our articles of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of 150,000,000 shares of our common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of the date hereof, we have designated 5,000,000 shares of the preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and have issued 500,000 of those shares. In certain circumstances, the common stock and/or the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as well as the awards available for issuance under our equity incentive plans, can be issued by our board of directors, without shareholder approval. Any future issuances of such stock would further dilute the percentage ownership of us held by holders of either class of our securities. In addition, the issuance of certain securities, may be used as an “anti-takeover” device without further action on the part of our shareholders, and may adversely affect the holders of the securities.
