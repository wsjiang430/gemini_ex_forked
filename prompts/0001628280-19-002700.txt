Item 1. Business
The Company

We are a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products. We are a Utah corporation with our principal place of business in Lehi, Utah, and sell our products to a sales force of independent distributors who uses the products themselves or resells them to consumers.
Business Segments

We have four business segments that are divided based on the different characteristics of their distributor and customer bases, distributor compensation plans and product formulations, as well as the internal organization of our officers and their responsibilities and business operations. Three business segments operate under the Nature’s Sunshine Products brand (NSP Americas; NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe; and NSP China), and one business segment operates under the Synergy® WorldWide brand. The NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe segment also includes our wholesale business, in which we sell our products to various locally-managed entities independent of the Company that we have granted distribution rights for the relevant market.
Product Categories

Our line of over 700 products includes several different product classifications, such as immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care, weight management and other general health products. We purchase herbs and other raw materials in bulk and, after rigorous quality control testing, we formulate, encapsulate, tablet or concentrate them, label and package them for shipment. Most of our products are manufactured at our facility in Spanish Fork, Utah. Contract manufacturers produce some of our products in accordance with our specifications and standards. We have implemented stringent quality control procedures to verify that our contract manufacturers have complied with our specifications and standards.

Presented below are the U.S. dollar amounts and associated revenue percentages from the sale of general health, immune, cardiovascular, digestive, personal care and weight management products for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, by business segment. This table should be read in conjunction with the information presented in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which discusses the factors impacting revenue trends and the costs associated with generating the aggregate revenue presented (in thousands).

Distribution and Selling

We distribute our products to consumers through an independent sales force comprised of independent distributors, known as Managers and Distributors. Our independent distributors, many of whom also consume our products, market products to customers through direct selling techniques, as well as sponsoring other independent distributors. Typically a person who joins our independent sales force begins as a Distributor. An independent Distributor may earn Manager status by attaining certain product sales levels. Although the nature of our relationship with our independent distributors limits the control we have to direct their activities, we seek to motivate and provide incentives to our independent distributors by offering high quality products and providing them with product support, training seminars, sales conventions, travel programs and financial incentives.

Our products sold in the United States are shipped directly from our manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Spanish Fork, Utah, as well as from our regional warehouses located in Georgia, Ohio and Texas. Many of our international operations maintain warehouse facilities and inventory to supply their independent Managers, Distributors and customers. However, in foreign markets where we do not maintain warehouse facilities, we have contracted with third-parties to distribute our products and provide support services to our independent sales force of independent Managers and Distributors.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 224,900 "active independent Distributors and customers" (as defined below). A person who joins our independent sales force begins as an independent Distributor. Many independent Distributors sell our products on a part-time basis to friends or associates or use the products themselves. An independent Distributor may earn Manager status by attaining certain product sales levels. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 12,600 "active independent Managers" (as defined below) worldwide. In many of our markets, our independent Managers and Distributors are primarily retailers of our products, including practitioners, proprietors of retail stores and other health and wellness specialists.

In the United States, we generally sell our products on a cash or credit card basis. From time to time, our U.S. operations extend short-term credit associated with product promotions. For certain of our international operations, we use independent distribution centers and offer credit terms that are generally consistent with industry standards within each respective country.

We pay sales commissions, or “volume incentives” to our independent Managers and Distributors based upon their own product sales and the product sales of their sales organization. As an exception, in NSP China, we do not pay volume 
6

incentives; rather, we pay independent service fees, which are included in selling, general and administrative expense. These volume incentives are recorded as an expense in the year earned. The amounts of volume incentives that we expensed during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, are set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. In addition to the opportunity to receive volume incentives, independent Managers who attain certain levels of monthly product sales are eligible for additional incentive programs including automobile allowances, sales convention privileges and travel awards.

Distributor Information

Our revenue is highly dependent upon the number and productivity of our independent Managers and Distributors. Growth in sales volume requires an increase in the productivity and/or growth in the total number of independent Managers and Distributors.
Within the Company, there are a number of different distributor compensation plans and qualifications, which generate active independent Managers and Distributors with different sales values in our different business segments. Within Synergy WorldWide, the sales qualifications required for active independent Managers and Distributors varies by market according to local economic factors. As sales grow in markets with higher qualification values, and decline in those with lower qualification values, the resultant mix change influences the active counts for independent Managers and Distributors. As a result, from time-to-time, changes in overall active counts for independent Managers and Distributors may not be indicative of actual sales trends for the segment.
In China, we do not sell our products through Managers and Distributors, but rather through independent service providers who are compensated for marketing, sales support, and other services.
The following table provides information concerning the number of total independent Managers, Distributors and customers by segment, as of the dates indicated.

 Source and Availability of Raw Materials

Raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are generally available from a number of suppliers. To date, we have not experienced any major difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate sources of raw materials supply. We attempt to ensure the availability of many of our raw materials by contracting, in advance, for our annual requirements. In the past, we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials when needed. Although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in locating such sources of supply in the future, we believe that we will be able to do so.
Trademarks and Trade Names

We have obtained trademark registrations for Nature’s Sunshine®, and the landscape logo for all of our Nature’s Sunshine Products product lines. We have also obtained trademark registrations for Synergy Worldwide® for all of our Synergy WorldWide product lines. We hold trademark registrations in the United States and in many other countries. Our customers’ recognition and association of our brands and trademarks with quality is an important element of our operating strategy.
The duration of our trademark registrations is generally between 10 and 20 years, depending on the country in which the marks are registered, and can be renewed. The scope and duration of our intellectual property protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product.

Seasonality

We operate in many regions around the world and, as a result, are affected by seasonal factors and trends such as weather changes, holidays and cultural traditions and vacation patterns throughout the world. For instance, in North America and Europe we typically experience a decrease in activity during the third quarter due to the summer vacation season, while we experience a decrease in activity in many of our Asia Pacific markets during the first quarter due to cultural events such as the Lunar New Year. As a result, there is some seasonality to our revenues and expenses reflected in our reported quarterly results. Generally, reductions in one region of the world due to seasonality are offset by increases in another, minimizing the impact on our reported consolidated revenues. Changes in the relative size of our revenues in one region of the world compared to another could cause seasonality to more significantly affect our reported quarterly results.
Inventories

In order to provide a high level of product availability to our independent Managers, Distributors, and customers, we maintain considerable inventory of raw materials in the United States and of finished goods in most countries in which we sell our products. Due to different regulatory requirements across the countries in which we sell our products, our finished goods inventories have product labels and sometimes product formulations specific for each country. Our inventories are subject to obsolescence due to finite shelf lives.
Dependence upon Distributors

A significant amount of our revenue in some of our markets is dependent on only a few independent distributors and their extensive sales networks. The loss of one or more of these independent distributors who, together with their extensive sales network generate a significant amount of our revenue, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition on one or more of our business segments.
Backlog

We typically ship orders for our products within 24 hours after receipt of payment. As a result, we have not historically experienced significant backlogs due to our high level of product availability as discussed above.
Competition

Our products are sold in competition with other companies, some of which have greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do, and sell brands that are, through advertising and promotions, better known to consumers. We compete in the nutritional and personal care industry against companies that sell through retail stores, as well as against other direct selling companies. For example, we compete against manufacturers and retailers of nutritional and personal care products, which are distributed through supermarkets, drug stores, health food stores, vitamin outlets, discount stores, and mass market retailers, among others. We compete for product sales and independent distributors with many other direct selling companies, including Amway, Herbalife, Nu Skin, Shaklee and USANA, among others. We believe that the principal components of competition in the direct selling of nutritional and personal care products are distributor expertise and service, product quality and differentiation, price and brand recognition. In addition, we rely on our independent Managers and Distributors to compete effectively in the direct selling markets, and our ability to attract and retain independent Managers and Distributors depends on various factors, including the training, quality product offerings and financial incentives for the independent Managers and Distributors.
Research and Development

We conduct research at our research center, known as the Hughes Center for Research and Innovation, a state of the art research and development facility located at our corporate offices in Lehi, Utah. Our principal emphasis in our research and development activities is clinical research in the support of the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products. 
Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations

The nature of our business has not required any material capital expenditures to comply with federal, state or local provisions enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. No material capital expenditures to meet such provisions are anticipated. Such regulatory provisions did not have a material effect upon our results of operations or competitive position in 2018.

Regulation

General

In both the United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance, court decisions and similar constraints (collectively “Regulations”). Such Regulations exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including Regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products; (2) product and earnings claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by independent distributors, for which we may be held responsible; (3) our direct selling program; (4) transfer pricing and similar regulations that affect the level of U.S. and foreign taxable income and customs duties; (5) taxation of our independent distributors (which in some instances may impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes and maintain appropriate records); and (6) currency exchange and repatriation.
Products

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies in the United States and in other countries. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates our products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“FDCA”). The FDCA defines the terms “food” and “dietary supplement” and sets forth various conditions that, unless complied with, may constitute adulteration or misbranding of such products. The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, including amendments by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (“NLEA”) and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (“DSHEA”).

FDA regulations relating specifically to foods and dietary supplements for human use are set forth in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations include basic labeling requirements for both foods and dietary supplements. In May 2016, the FDA announced new labeling requirements to reflect recently available scientific information. The new label requirements are intended to make it easier for consumers to make informed choices. Manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales have until January 1, 2020, to comply with the new labeling requirements. Additionally, FDA regulations require us to meet relevant good manufacturing practice regulations relating to, among other things, the preparation, packaging and storage of our food and dietary supplements.

FDA rules impose requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, and distribution of dietary supplement products. For example, it requires that companies establish written procedures governing areas such as: (1) personnel, (2) plant and equipment cleanliness, (3) production controls, (4) laboratory operations, (5) packaging and labeling, (6) distribution, (7) product returns, and (8) complaint handling. The FDA also requires identity testing of all incoming dietary ingredients unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. The current good manufacturing practices are designed to ensure that dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products. Ingredient identification requirements, which require us to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on our product labels within a narrow range, are particularly burdensome and difficult for us with respect to our product formulations, which contain many different ingredients.
In some countries we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for the conduct of our independent distributors, and regulations applicable to the activities of our independent Managers and Distributors also affect our business. In these countries, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our independent distributors comply with regulations. The types of regulated conduct include: (1) representations concerning our products; (2) earnings representations made by us and/or our independent distributors; (3) public media advertisements, which in foreign markets may require prior approval by regulators; (4) sales of products in markets in which the products have not been approved, licensed, registered or certified for sale; and (5) classification by government agencies of our independent distributors as our employees.

In some markets, it is possible that improper product claims by our independent Managers and Distributors could result in our products being reviewed by regulatory authorities and, as a result, being classified or placed into another category as to which stricter regulations are applicable. In addition, we might be required to make labeling changes.

We are unable to predict the nature of any future regulations, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. They could, however, 
10

require: (1) reformulation of some products not capable of being reformulated; (2) imposition of additional record keeping requirements; (3) expanded documentation of the properties of some products; (4) expanded or different labeling; (5) additional or different scientific substantiation regarding product ingredients, safety or usefulness; and/or (6) additional distributor compliance surveillance and enforcement action by us. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license, registration or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license, registration or certificate is required, we work extensively with local authorities to obtain the requisite approvals. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.

Direct Selling

Our business practices and products are also regulated by the following United States governmental entities: the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Our activities, including our direct selling distribution activities, are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold.

The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. The FTC closely scrutinizes the use of testimonials, the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. The FTC has in recent years investigated and taken enforcement action against direct selling companies for misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of an independent distributor within a company's compensation plan, as well as appropriateness of the compensation plans themselves. For example, in 2015, the FTC initiated an enforcement action against a direct selling company, alleging an illegal business model and improper earnings claims, which the FTC and the direct selling company settled in September 2016, by entering into a stipulated order. In July 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement agreement with another direct selling company, which required the particular direct selling company to restructure its U.S. business operations to settle charges relating to deceptive advertising, misrepresentation and an illegal business model. The settlement of each of these cases required the direct selling company involved to, among other things, pay a significant fine, revise its compensation plan to comply with restrictions on how it can compensate its independent distributors and change its marketing practices to avoid misleading income, earning and other representations. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future.

Transfer Pricing

In many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our U.S. or local entities and are taxed accordingly. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products.

Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed.

In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future.

11

Other Regulations

We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to social security assessments, employment and severance pay requirements, import/export regulations and antitrust issues. As an example, in many markets, we are substantially restricted in the amount and types of rules and termination criteria that we can impose on our independent distributors without having to pay social security assessments on behalf of the independent distributors and without incurring severance obligations to terminated independent distributors. In some countries, we may be subject to these obligations in any event.

Our failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in a particular market or in general. Assertions that we failed to comply with regulations or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could adversely affect us in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets.

Compliance

In order to comply with regulations that apply to both us and our independent distributors, we conduct research into the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify all necessary licenses, registrations and approvals and applicable limitations on our operations in that market. Typically, we conduct this research with the assistance of local legal counsel and other representatives. We devote substantial resources to obtaining the necessary licenses, registrations and approvals and bringing our operations into compliance with the applicable limitations. We also research laws applicable to independent distributor operations and revise or alter our distributor manuals and other training materials and programs to provide independent distributors with guidelines for operating a business, selling and distributing our products and similar matters, as required by applicable regulations in each market. We are unable to monitor our independent distributors effectively to ensure that they refrain from distributing our products in countries where we have not commenced operations.

In addition, regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators. Moreover, even when we believe that we and our independent distributors are initially in compliance with all applicable regulations, new regulations regularly are being added and the interpretation of existing regulations is subject to change. Further, the content and impact of regulations to which we are subject may be influenced by public attention directed at us, our products or our direct selling program, so that extensive adverse publicity about our products or our direct selling program may result in increased regulatory scrutiny.

It is an ongoing part of our business to anticipate and respond to new and changing regulations and to make corresponding changes in our operations to the extent practicable. Although we devote considerable resources to maintaining our compliance with regulatory constraints in each of our markets, we cannot be sure that (1) we would be found to be in full compliance with applicable regulations in all of our markets at any given time or (2) the regulatory authorities in one or more markets will not assert, either retroactively or prospectively or both, that our operations are not in full compliance. These assertions or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could negatively affect us in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets. These assertions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in a particular market or in general. Furthermore, depending upon the severity of regulatory changes in a particular market and the changes in our operations that would be necessitated to maintain compliance, these changes could result in us experiencing a material reduction in revenue in the market or determining to exit the market altogether. In this event, we would attempt to devote the resources previously devoted to such market to a new market or markets or other existing markets. However, we cannot be sure that this transition would not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition either in the short or long-term.

To further mitigate any compliance risk, a Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compliance Committee") was created in 2014. The purpose of the Compliance Committee is to oversee our efforts with respect to operational compliance. “Operational Compliance” is defined by the Compliance Committee's charter to include: distributor compliance and direct selling best practices; employee compliance, including code of conduct and other mandated trainings; product and product distribution regulatory compliance, including adherence to FTC, FDA and other similar regulatory bodies’ mandates; compliance with data protection regulations; and non-financial, whistleblower reports. For avoidance of doubt, "Operational Compliance" does not include adherence to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), which is the responsibility of the Audit Committee.
