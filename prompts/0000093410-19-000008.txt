General Development of Business
Summary Description of Chevron 
Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. 
A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-1. As of December 31, 2018, Chevron had approximately 48,600 employees (including about 3,600 service station employees). Approximately 24,800 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees), or 51 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. 
Overview of Petroleum Industry 
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas 
Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2018 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 32, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-7. 
The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. 
United States
Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in the midcontinent region, the Gulf of Mexico, California and the Appalachian Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2018 averaged 791,000 barrels per day. 
The company's activities in the midcontinent region are primarily in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. During 2018, net daily production in these areas averaged 198,000 barrels of crude oil, 651 million cubic feet of natural gas and 77,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2018, the company divested properties in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. The company is pursuing opportunities to increase development efficiency across the region.
In the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico, the company holds approximately 500,000 and 1,200,000 net acres of shale and tight resources in the Midland and Delaware basins, respectively. This acreage includes multiple stacked formations that enable production from several layers of rock in different geologic zones. Chevron has implemented a factory development strategy in the basin, which utilizes multiwell pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. The company is also applying data analytics and technology on its Permian well information to drive improvements in well targets and performance. In 2018, the company's net daily production in the basin averaged 159,000 barrels of crude oil, 501 million cubic feet of natural gas and 66,000 barrels of NGLs.
During 2018, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 186,000 barrels of crude oil, 117 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields. 
The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2018 averaged 139,000 barrels of liquids (71,000 net) and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas (11 million net). Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields progressed in 2018. Stage 2 of the development plan was completed with four planned wells on production. Development drilling continued on Stage 3, with two of the three planned wells completed at the end of 2018. Proved reserves have been recognized for these phases. The St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project entered front-end engineering design (FEED) in 2018 and is expected to reach final investment decision in third quarter 2019. At the end of 2018, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years.
At the 58 percent-owned and operated deepwater Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 51,000 barrels of crude oil, 22 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. Infill drilling continued in 2018 with one new infill well completed. The Tahiti Vertical Expansion project, the next development phase of the Tahiti Field, is developing shallower reservoirs and encompassing four new wells and associated subsea infrastructure. First oil was achieved from three wells in June 2018, and a fourth well is scheduled to come on line in second quarter 2019. The Tahiti Field has an estimated remaining production life of at least 25 years.
The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the deepwater Mad Dog Field. In 2018, net daily production averaged 8,000 barrels of liquids and 1 million cubic feet of natural gas. Project execution continued in 2018 with the next development phase, the Mad Dog 2 Project. This phase of the plan is to develop the southwestern extension of the Mad Dog Field including a new floating production platform with a design capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day. First oil is expected in 2021. Proved reserves have been recognized for the Mad Dog 2 Project.

The development plan for the 60 percent-owned and operated deepwater Big Foot Project includes a 15-slot drilling and production tension leg platform with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. First oil was achieved in November 2018 and is expected to continue ramp up during 2019. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years.
Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project located in the Green Canyon area. First oil was achieved in January 2018. In 2018, total daily production averaged 16,000 barrels of crude oil (4,000 net) and 4 million cubic feet of natural gas (1 million net). Production is expected to continue to ramp up until early 2020. The field has an estimated production life of 30 years. 
Chevron has owned and operated interests of 55 to 61.3 percent in the blocks containing the Anchor Field. In 2018, the Anchor Field was expanded to include acreage in two additional blocks. FEED activities commenced in 2018 for Stage 1 of the Anchor development, which consists of a seven-well subsea development and semi-submersible floating production unit. The planned facility has a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 28 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. At the end of 2018, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project.
Chevron has a 60 percent-owned and operated interest in the Ballymore field located in the Mississippi Canyon area and a 40 percent nonoperated working interest in the Whale discovery located in the Perdido area. In January 2018, the company announced a significant crude oil discovery at Ballymore. Appraisal activities are underway to evaluate this opportunity and identify a cost-effective development plan. At the Whale discovery, results of the exploration and appraisal wells are being assessed in parallel to progressing cost-effective development options.
