Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
The Company, formed in November 2007 as a Virginia corporation, is a self-advised REIT that invests in income-producing real estate, primarily in the lodging sector, in the United States (“U.S.”). The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 241 hotels with an aggregate of 30,812 rooms located in urban, high-end suburban and developing markets throughout 34 states. All of the Company’s hotels operate under Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt brands. The hotels are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 23 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The Company’s common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “APLE.” The Company has no foreign operations or assets and its operating structure includes only one reportable segment. Refer to Part II, Item 8, for the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Business Objectives
 
The Company is one of the largest hospitality REITs in the U.S., in both the number of hotels and guest rooms, with significant geographic and brand diversity. The Company’s primary business objective is to maximize shareholder value by achieving long-term growth in cash available for distributions to its shareholders. The Company has pursued and will continue to pursue this objective through the following investment strategies:

● | pursuing thoughtful capital allocation with selective acquisitions and dispositions of primarily rooms-focused hotels in the upscale sector of the lodging industry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | employing broad geographic diversification of its investments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | franchising and collaborating with leading brands in the sector;

● | reinvesting in the Company’s hotels to maintain their competitive advantage; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintaining low leverage providing the Company with financial flexibility.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company has generally acquired fee simple ownership of its properties, with a focus on hotels that have or have the potential to have diverse demand generators, strong brand recognition, high levels of customer satisfaction and strong operating margins. The acquisitions have been in broadly diversified markets across the U.S. to limit dependence on any one geographic area or demand generator. With an emphasis on upscale rooms-focused hotels, the Company utilizes its asset management experience and expertise to improve the quality and performance of its hotels by working with its property managers to aggressively manage room rates and cost structure by benchmarking with internal and external data, using the Company’s scale to help negotiate favorable vendor contracts, engaging industry leaders in hotel management, and franchising the hotels with leading brands and actively participating with the franchisors to strengthen the brands. To maintain its competitive advantage in each market, the Company continually reinvests in its hotels. With its depth of ownership in many upscale and upper mid-scale rooms-focused brands and extensive experience with the Hilton and Marriott rooms-focused brands, the Company has been able to enhance its reinvestment approach. By maintaining a flexible balance sheet, with a total debt to total capitalization (total debt outstanding plus equity market capitalization based on the Company’s December 31, 2018 closing share price) ratio at December 31, 2018 of 31%, the Company is positioned to opportunistically consider investments that further improve shareholder value.
 
Hotel Operating Performance 
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 241 hotels with a total of 30,812 rooms as compared to 239 hotels with a total of 30,322 rooms as of December 31, 2017. Operating performance is included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2018 and 2017. During 2018, the Company acquired one newly constructed hotel on May 2, 2018 and four existing hotels (two on February 5, 2018, one on June 28, 2018 and one on December 7, 2018), and sold three hotels (two on July 13, 2018 and one on November 29, 2018). During 2017, the Company acquired three newly constructed hotels (one on February 2, 2017 and two on September 12, 2017) and three existing hotels (one on October 13, 2017, one on October 20, 2017, and one on December 1, 2017) and sold two hotels (one on April 20, 2017 and one on October 5, 2017). The following table reflects certain operating statistics for the Company’s hotels for their respective periods of ownership by the Company. Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) is calculated as room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold, and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) is calculated as occupancy multiplied by ADR.

 | Years Ended December 31, |

Comparable Hotels Operating Performance
 
The following table reflects certain operating statistics for the Company’s 241 hotels owned as of December 31, 2018 (“Comparable Hotels”). The Company defines metrics from Comparable Hotels as results generated by the 241 hotels owned as of the end of the reporting period. For the hotels acquired during the reporting periods shown, the Company has included, as applicable, results of those hotels for periods prior to the Company’s ownership using information provided by the properties’ prior owners at the time of acquisition and not adjusted by the Company. This information has not been audited, either for the periods owned or prior to ownership by the Company. For dispositions, results have been excluded for the Company’s period of ownership.

 | Years Ended December 31, |

Hotel performance is impacted by many factors, including the economic conditions in the U.S. and in each individual locality.  Improvements in the general U.S. economy have been offset by increased lodging supply in many markets, offsetting increases in demand and resulting in essentially flat revenue growth. During 2018, the Company’s Comparable Hotels experienced a slight increase in ADR and a slight decrease in occupancy as compared to 2017, leaving RevPAR virtually unchanged. Overall, the Company’s Comparable Hotels’ RevPAR change for 2018 was in line with industry/brand averages. The Company, on a comparable basis, is forecasting slightly negative to slightly positive RevPAR growth for 2019 as compared to 2018, which reflects modestly lower expectations for demand growth, consistent with lower expected Gross Domestic Product growth in the U.S., relatively consistent anticipated hotel supply growth and slightly favorable comparisons caused by natural disasters. See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Company’s results of operations.
2018 Investing Activities
 
The Company continually monitors market conditions and attempts to maximize shareholder value by investing in properties that it believes provide superior value over the long term.  Consistent with this strategy and the Company’s focus on investing in rooms-focused hotels, the Company acquired five hotels for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $152.2 million during 2018: a 119-room Hampton Inn & Suites in downtown Atlanta, Georgia; a 144-room Hampton Inn & Suites in Memphis, Tennessee; a 210-room Hampton Inn & Suites in downtown Phoenix, Arizona; a 132-room Hampton Inn & Suites in Atlanta Perimeter Dunwoody, Georgia; and a 127-room Hyatt Place in Jacksonville, Florida. As of January 31, 2019, the Company also has outstanding contracts for the potential purchase of six additional hotels for a total purchase price of approximately $162.5 million, five of which are under development and are planned to be completed and opened for business over the next three to 24 months from December 31, 2018, at which time closings on these hotels are expected to occur, and one existing hotel that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. The Company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund the completed acquisitions and plans to utilize its credit facilities for any additional acquisitions.
 
For its existing portfolio, the Company monitors each property’s profitability, market conditions and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by disposing of properties when it believes that superior value can be provided from the sale of the property.  As a result, the Company sold three hotels for an aggregate sales price of approximately $15.8 million during 2018: its 89-room SpringHill Suites and its 86-room TownePlace Suites in Columbus, Georgia (the “two Columbus hotels”), and its 72-room Residence Inn in Springdale, Arkansas. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had an outstanding contract to sell 16 of its hotels for a gross sales price of $175 million. This contract was terminated in February 2019 and the Company entered into two purchase and sale agreements with the same unrelated party for the sale of a total of nine properties for a total combined gross sales price of $95 million. The Company holds a non-refundable deposit of $7 million on these contracts. If the closings occur, these sales are expected to be completed in the first half of 2019. The net proceeds from the sales were or will be used to pay down borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility.
 
See Note 3 titled “Investment in Real Estate” and Note 4 titled “Dispositions and Hotel Sale Contracts” in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these transactions.
 
In addition to continually considering opportunities to invest in rooms-focused hotels, the Company also monitors the trading price of its common shares and repurchases its common shares when it believes there is an opportunity to increase shareholder value. During 2018, the Company purchased under its authorized $464 million share repurchase program (“Share Repurchase Program”) approximately 6.6 million of its common shares at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately $15.87 per common share for an aggregate purchase price, including commissions, of approximately $104.3 million. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program have been funded, and the Company intends to fund future repurchases, with availability under its credit facilities. The timing of share repurchases and the number of common shares to be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. See Note 8 titled “Shareholders’ Equity” in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the Share Repurchase Program.

Hotel Industry and Competition 
 
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Each of the Company’s hotels competes for guests primarily with other hotels in its immediate vicinity and secondarily with other hotels or lodging facilities in its geographic market. An increase in the number of competitive hotels or other lodging facilities in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy, ADR and RevPAR of the Company’s hotels in that area. The Company believes that brand recognition, location, price and quality (of both the hotel and the services provided) are the principal competitive factors affecting the Company’s hotels. Additionally, general economic conditions in a particular market and nationally impact the performance of the hotel industry.
Management and Franchise Agreements

All of the Company’s hotels operate under Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt brands, and as of December 31, 2018, consisted of the following:
 

Number of Hotels and Guest Rooms by Brand
-----------------------------------------
 | Number of | | Number of
Brand | Hotels | | Rooms 
Hilton Garden Inn | | 42 | | 5,807 
Courtyard | | 40 | | 5,460 
Hampton | | 40 | | 5,029 
Homewood Suites | | 34 | | 3,831 
Residence Inn | | 33 | | 3,939 
SpringHill Suites | | 16 | | 2,159 
Fairfield | | 11 | | 1,300 
TownePlace Suites | | 11 | | 1,110 
Home2 Suites | | 8 | | 910 
Marriott | | 2 | | 616 
Embassy Suites | | 2 | | 316 
Renaissance | | 1 | | 208 
Hyatt Place | | 1 | | 127 
Total | | 241 | | 30,812

 
Each of the Company’s 241 hotels owned as of December 31, 2018 is operated and managed under separate management agreements with 23 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The management agreements generally provide for initial terms of one to 30 years. The Company has the option to terminate the management agreements if specified performance thresholds are not satisfied. As of December 31, 2018, over 80% of the Company’s hotels operate under a variable management fee agreement, with an average initial term of two years, which the Company believes better aligns incentives for each hotel manager to maximize each property’s performance than a base-plus-incentive management fee structure, as described below, which is more common throughout the industry. Under the variable fee structure, the management fee earned for each hotel is generally within a range of 2.5% to 3.5% of gross revenues, based on each hotel’s performance relative to other hotels owned by the Company. The performance measures are based on various financial and quality performance metrics. The Company’s remaining hotels operate under a management fee structure which generally includes the payment of base management fees and an opportunity for incentive management fees. Under this structure, base management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues and the incentive management fees are calculated as a percentage of operating profit in excess of a priority return to the Company, as defined in the management agreements. In addition to the above, management fees for all of the Company’s hotels generally include accounting fees and other fees for centralized services, which are allocated among all of the hotels that receive the benefit of such services.
 
Sixteen of the Company’s hotels are managed by affiliates of Marriott or Hilton. The remainder of the Company’s hotels are managed by companies that are not affiliated with either Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt, and, as a result, the hotels they manage were required to obtain separate franchise agreements with each respective franchisor. The franchise agreements generally provide for initial terms of approximately 10 to 30 years and generally provide for renewals subject to franchise requirements at the time of renewal. The Company pays various fees under these agreements, including the payment of royalty fees, marketing fees, reservation fees, a communications support fee, brand loyalty program fees and other similar fees based on room revenues.

The franchise and/or management agreements provide a variety of benefits for the Company, which include national advertising, publicity, and other marketing programs designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel, continuous review of quality standards, centralized reservation systems and best practices within the industry.
Hotel Maintenance and Renovation 
 
The Company’s hotels have an ongoing need for renovation and refurbishment. To maintain and enhance each property’s competitive position in its market, the Company has invested in and plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels. During 2018 and 2017, the Company’s capital improvements for its hotels were approximately $71.1 million and $69.1 million, respectively. During 2019, the Company anticipates investing approximately $80 to $90 million in capital improvements, which includes various scheduled renovation projects for approximately 30 to 35 properties.  
Financing
 
The Company’s principal daily sources of liquidity are the operating cash flow generated from the Company’s properties and availability under its revolving credit facility. Depending on market conditions, the Company also has the ability to enter into additional secured and unsecured debt financing and to issue common shares under its at-the-market offering program discussed below.  The Company anticipates that funds from these sources will be adequate to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements, including debt service, hotel acquisitions, hotel renovations, share repurchases, and required distributions to shareholders (the Company is not required to make distributions at its current rate for REIT purposes).
 
During 2018, the Company completed the refinancing of two of its primary credit facilities. In July and August 2018, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of its $965 million credit facility and its $150 million term loan facility. The changes under the facilities included: reducing the capacity of the $965 million credit facility to $850 million; increasing the capacity of the $150 million term loan facility to $225 million; extending the maturities of each of the loans under the facilities; reducing the annual interest rate; and improving certain covenants as compared to the previous agreements.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.4 billion of total outstanding debt with a combined weighted-average interest rate, including the effect of interest rate swaps, of approximately 3.74%, consisting of approximately $488.8 million in outstanding mortgage debt secured by 31 properties, with maturity dates ranging from June 2020 to January 2038 and stated interest rates ranging from 3.55% to 6.25%, and approximately $928.8 million in outstanding debt under its unsecured credit facilities with maturity dates ranging from July 2022 to August 2025 and effective interest rates, including the effect of interest rate swaps, ranging from 2.44% to 4.24%.
 
The Company’s unused borrowing capacity under its credit facilities as of December 31, 2018 was $231.2 million, consisting of $156.2 million available under its $425 million revolving credit facility, which is available for acquisitions, hotel renovations, share repurchases, working capital and other general corporate funding purposes, including the payment of distributions to shareholders, and $75.0 million under its $225 million term loan facility, which was drawn by the Company on January 29, 2019 and used to pay down borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility. As discussed above, the Company has historically maintained and plans in the future to maintain relatively low leverage as compared to the real estate industry as a whole and the lodging sector in particular. The Company’s ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of December 31, 2018 was 31%. Although this ratio is low relative to the industry, it is slightly higher than in prior years as a result of market declines in the Company’s share price (which have affected the lodging sector as a whole) and share repurchases made by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, the Company anticipates this ratio declining if the potential sales transactions discussed above are completed. As it did during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company may increase debt levels at any time to take advantage of investment opportunities, but would plan to reduce any significant increases as appropriate with the issuance of equity or property dispositions to maintain its flexible balance sheet and reduce risks to investors compared to those of highly leveraged companies. The Company plans to maintain staggered maturities of its debt, utilize unsecured debt when available and fix the rate on the majority of its debt. All of these strategies reduce shareholder risk related to the Company’s financing structure. See Note 5 titled “Debt” in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company’s debt.

Index


In 2017, the Company executed an equity distribution agreement that allows the Company to sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $300 million of its common shares through sales agents under an at-the-market offering program (the “ATM Program”).  During the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold approximately 0.2 million common shares under its ATM Program at a weighted-average market sales price of approximately $19.73 per common share and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4.8 million before commissions and issuance costs. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold approximately 6.9 million common shares under its ATM Program at a weighted-average market sales price of approximately $19.55 per common share and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $135.1 million before commissions and issuance costs. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of these shares to pay down borrowings on its revolving credit facility. Future sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common shares and opportunities for uses of any proceeds. 
Distribution Policy

The Company plans to continue to pay a consistent distribution on a monthly basis, with distributions based on anticipated cash generated from operations. The Company’s annualized distribution rate was $1.20 per common share at December 31, 2018. As it has done historically, due to seasonality, the Company may use its revolving credit facility to maintain the consistency of the monthly distribution rate, taking into consideration any acquisitions, dispositions, capital improvements and economic cycles.  Any distribution is subject to approval of the Company’s Board of Directors and there can be no assurance of the classification or duration of distributions at the current annual distribution rate. The Board of Directors monitors the Company’s distribution rate relative to the performance of its hotels on an ongoing basis and may make adjustments to the distribution rate as determined to be prudent in relation to other cash requirements of the Company. If cash flow from operations and the revolving credit facility are not adequate to meet liquidity requirements, the Company may utilize additional financing sources to make distributions. Although the Company has relatively low levels of debt, there can be no assurance it will be successful with this strategy and may need to reduce its distributions to required levels to maintain its REIT status. If the Company were unable to extend its maturing debt in future periods or if it were to default on its debt, it may be unable to make distributions.
Insurance
 
The Company maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of its hotels. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that the Company believes are customary for similar types of properties in similar locations. However, various types of catastrophic losses, like earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism, may not be insurable or may not be economically insurable.
Environmental Matters 
 
The Company’s hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and waste water discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management, and impose liability for contamination. In connection with each of the Company’s hotel acquisitions, the Company reviewed a Phase I Environmental Report and additional environmental reports and surveys, as were necessitated by the preliminary report. Based on the reports, the Company is not aware of any environmental situations requiring remediation at the Company’s properties, which have not been, or are not currently being remediated as necessary. No material remediation costs have occurred or are expected to occur. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose the Company to the possibility that it may become liable to reimburse governments for damages and costs they incur in connection with hazardous substances.
Seasonality 
 
The hotel industry historically has been seasonal in nature. Seasonal variations in occupancy at the Company’s hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in its revenues. Generally, occupancy rates and hotel revenues are greater

in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, the Company expects to utilize cash on hand or available financing sources to meet cash requirements.
Related Parties
 
The Company has, and is expected to continue to engage in, transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm’s length and the results of the Company’s operations may be different if these transactions were conducted with non-related parties. See Note 7 titled “Related Parties” in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the Company’s related party transactions.
Employees 
 
During 2018, all employees involved in the day-to-day operation of the Company’s hotels were employed by third party management companies engaged pursuant to the hotel management agreements. At December 31, 2018, the Company had 62 employees. The employees not only provide support to the Company, but, as discussed in Note 7 titled “Related Parties” in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain employees also provide support services to Apple Realty Group, Inc. (“ARG”), which is wholly owned by Glade M. Knight, Executive Chairman of the Company. ARG reimburses the Company for the support services that it receives.
