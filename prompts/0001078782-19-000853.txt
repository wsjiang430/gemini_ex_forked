ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 23, 2010, under the name Recursos Montana S.A. The Company’s principal activity was as a pre-exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties then owned by the Company. During this time, the Company was deemed a “shell company” in the pre-exploration stage and was ultimately unable to commence exploration activities.
 
On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., whereby the Company acquired 100% of Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock equal 51% of the issued and outstanding common stock and cash consideration to Tanaris in the aggregate amount of $350,000. Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. was the owner of certain rights in connection with the marketing and sale of smart lithium-ion batteries and battery technologies for various industrial vehicles markets and related applications. On March 6, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc.
 
On April 25, 2016, Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (“HFOI”), and the controlling stockholders of HFOI (the “HFOI Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of HFOI from the HFOI shareholders (the “HFOI Shares”) and in exchange the Company issued to the HFOI Shareholders 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of its common stock (the “HMMR Shares”). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, HFOI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd. was formed in the State of Delaware on June 13, 2014.
 
On April 13, 2016, our board of directors approved a Plan of Merger (the “Plan of Merger”) under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Section 92A.180 to merge (the “Merger”) with our wholly-owned subsidiary Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. to Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. The Plan of Merger also provided for a 1 for 1,000 exchange ratio for shareholders of both the Company and Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., which had the effect of a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of our common stock. Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 13, 2016 and, on April 14, 2016, this corporate action was submitted to FINRA for its review and approval.
