ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, or unless specifically stated otherwise, references to the “Company”, “PlayAGS”, “AGS”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to PlayAGS, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a Nevada corporation formed and incorporated originally in Delaware in August 2013 and then reincorporated in Nevada in December 2017. We were formed to acquire, through one of our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, 100% of the equity in AGS Capital, LLC (“AGS Capital”) from AGS Holdings, LLC (“AGS Holdings”). AGS Capital was a supplier of Electronic Gaming Machines (“EGMs”) primarily to Class II Native American gaming jurisdictions.
We are a leading designer and supplier of EGMs and other products and services for the gaming industry. Founded in 2005, we historically focused on supplying EGMs, including slot machines, video bingo machines, and other electronic gaming devices, to the Native American gaming market, where we maintain an approximately 19% market share of all Class II EGMs. Since 2014, we have expanded our product line-up to include: (i) Class III EGMs for commercial and Native American casinos permitted to operate Class III EGMs, (ii) table game products and (iii) interactive products, all of which we believe provide us with growth opportunities as we expand in markets where we currently have limited or no presence. Our expansion into Class III and ancillary product offerings has driven our strong growth and momentum in revenue, EGM adjusted EBITDA and our installed base. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 71% of our total revenue was generated through recurring contracted lease agreements whereby we place EGMs and table game products at our customers’ gaming facilities under either a revenue sharing agreement (we receive a percentage of the revenues that these products generate) or fee-per-day agreement (we receive a daily or monthly fixed fee per EGM or table game product), or recurring revenue from our Interactive gaming operations. We operate our business in three distinct segments: EGMs, Table Products and Interactive. Each segment's activities include the design, development, acquisition, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, installation and servicing of a distinct product line.

 | Percentage of Total Revenue
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Electronic Gaming Machines | 95 | % | | 94 | % | 94 | %
Table Products | 3 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
Interactive | 2 | % | | 4 | % | 5 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Our Operations
We provide customers with EGMs, table products, ancillary table product equipment, systems software, computer hardware, signage and other equipment for operation within their gaming facilities. In return we receive either cash for sold items, or a share of the revenue generated by these products and systems, either as a flat monthly fee or a daily fee. The determination of whether our agreement results in a revenue share, monthly fee, or daily fee arrangement is generally governed by local gaming jurisdictions. For our revenue share arrangements on EGM products, we have historically shared between 15% and 20% of the revenues generated by the EGMs. Under our agreements for EGMs, we participate in selecting the mix of titles, maintain and service the equipment and oversee certain promotional efforts. When sold, we offer the majority of our products with an optional parts and service contract. For Table Products we typically license table games and lease related equipment for which we receive monthly royalty and lease payments. We also lease and sell roulette and baccarat signs and plan to lease and sell our new shuffler, Dex S. Our Interactive segment generates revenues from (1) B2C social products where consumers purchase virtual coins used to play social casino games, (2) B2B social products where we obtain a percentage of monthly revenue generated by the white label casino apps that we build and operate for our customers, and (3) real-money gaming (“RMG”) revenues, which are earned primarily based on a percentage of the revenue produced by the games on our platform as well as monthly platform fees and initial integration fees. In support of our business and operations, we employ a professional staff including field service technicians, production, sales, account management, marketing, technology and game development, licensing and compliance and finance.
Our corporate headquarters are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, which serves as the primary location for the executive management and administrative functions such as finance, legal, licensing and compliance. Our licensing and compliance division oversees the application and renewal of our corporate gaming licenses, findings of suitability for key officers and directors and certification of our gaming equipment and systems for specific jurisdictions, human resources, as well as coordinating gaming equipment and software shipping and on-site and remote service of our equipment with gaming authorities.

Our field service technicians are responsible for installing, maintaining and servicing our gaming products and systems. Our EGM field service operation including our call center, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is managed out of our Oklahoma facility. We can also access most of our EGMs and systems remotely from approved remote locations to provide software updates and routine maintenance. In addition, our EGM and system production facilities are located in and managed out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Atlanta, Georgia, and Mexico City, Mexico. Our Table Product service and production facilities are primarily managed from Las Vegas, Nevada with certain products produced in our Oklahoma facility.
Sales, product management and account management are managed through our various locations and are located throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. Sales and account management oversee the customer relationship at the individual location as well as at the corporate level and are responsible for developing new customer relationships. Account management is in charge of running on-site promotions and corporate sponsorship programs. In addition, our marketing team is in charge of general corporate marketing, including advertisements and participation at industry trade shows. 
We employ game developers, software and system programmers, project managers and other development and administrative staff that oversee our internal game development efforts and manage third party relationships. Our EGM technology and game development operates primarily out of our Atlanta, Georgia and Sydney, Australia locations and to a lesser extent out of our locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Austin, Texas. Our Table Products technology and development operates primarily out of our Las Vegas, Nevada location. We have Interactive development teams in San Francisco, California and Tel Aviv, Israel and through the recent acquisition of Gameiom Technologies Limited (“Gameiom” currently known as “AGS iGaming”), in Hinckley, United Kingdom. Additionally, we hire independent contractors in Ukraine to support the on-line operations of AGS iGaming.
Products

We provide our casino customers with high-performing Class II and Class III EGMs for the tribal and commercial gaming markets, more than 40 unique table products offerings, ancillary table products equipment, systems software, computer hardware, signage, and other equipment for operation within gaming facilities. In our AGS Interactive segment, we offer a vast library of casino-themed social and mobile games, business-to-business social casino solutions available to land-based casino customers, and a real-money gaming platform and library of games for on-line operators.

EGM Segment
EGMs constitute our largest segment, representing 95% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have a library of over 380 proprietary game titles that we deliver on several state-of-the-art EGM cabinets, including ICON and Orion Upright (our core cabinets), Orion Portrait (our premium cabinet) and Orion Slant (our core plus cabinet) and Big Red/Colossal Diamonds (our specialty large-format jumbo cabinet). Our cabinets and game titles are consistently named among the top-performing premium leased games in the industry. We also have developed a new Latin style bingo cabinet called Alora, which we plan to use in select international markets, including Mexico, the Philippines, and potentially Brazil.
We design all of our cabinets with the intention of capturing the attention of players on casino floors while aiming to maximize operator profits. The fourth quarter 2018 Eilers - Fantini Quarterly Slot Survey stated our premium leased games outperform most of the EGMs manufactured by our competitors, generating win per day that is up to 1.7 times higher than house average.
Below are a few of our more significant cabinets: 
Orion -  Our Orion line of game cabinets delivers performance, flexibility, and style. We currently offer three Orion slot cabinets - Portrait, Slant, and the newly introduced Upright, which we will launch into the market in 2019. Engineered for multiple configurations, this cabinet family is powered by a common platform, available for Class II and Class III markets, and benefits from easy servicing. Powered by our Atlas operating platform, the Orion family’s self-contained logic and use of a common platform eliminate the need for multiple servers. Full-color LED lights surround Orion’s HD LCD touchscreen monitor, capable of changing colors and patterns on each machine or across entire banks in a manner that corresponds to each feature within the game. We unveiled our Orion Portrait cabinet at the Global Gaming Expo in late 2016 to positive customer feedback, and the platform has exceeded our performance expectations. In 2018, we introduced our second Orion cabinet - the Orion Slant, featuring the same distinctive starwall design, dual LCD HD monitors, and the latest HD audio for a cinematic surround-sound experience. At the Global Gaming Expo in 2018, we introduced the Orion Upright, which we expect to launch into the market in 2019. Our Orion platform family is driving momentum in Class III and newly addressable markets, and is a key driver of our equipment sales business.

ICON - Our ICON cabinet offers modern design with seamless integration of light and sound, ergonomic features, and stunning visual effects to complement our premium game content and play mechanics. The ICON is equipped with two flush- mounted 23” HD LCDs, an integrated sound system, and two subtle light panels surrounding the LCD monitors which react to on-screen events enhancing game features, building anticipation, celebrating big wins, and highlighting bonus events. The ICON has served as our “workhorse” since its introduction, serving as the single biggest growth driver for our business due to its reliability and deep portfolio of games. 
Big Red - Big Red is a premium, specialty cabinet focused on simple, classic spinning-reel gameplay. At 8’ tall and 8’ wide, its massive size and bright red color commands attention on the casino floor and creates a community-style gaming experience. Currently available with our top-performing game title Colossal Diamonds, Big Red is engineered for both Class II and Class III formats.
Alora - Alora is a specialty cabinet designed specifically for the Latin-style bingo player. Designed by a team of Brazilians for the potential Brazil market opening, the cabinet will be deployed in the Philippines and Mexico, both of which currently have mature and stable Latin-style bingo markets. The Alora platform supports dual screen 23.8” monitors and features a unique illuminated foot pedal that gives players the option to play without using the button panel. Each game theme offered on this platform supports instant bonuses, stand-alone progressives, and a community progressive. We believe that Latin-style bingo game titles have a longer life span as compared to traditional EGMs due to the nature of the markets in which these titles are deployed and the local player base. Currently, we have 12 game titles for the Alora platform, including the popular Lotto Diamond, Bingolandia, Show de Balla and Go Bananas, available in multiple languages, including Portuguese, Spanish, and English. 
We categorize our EGM titles into two main groups: “Core” and “Premium and Specialty”. Our Core titles have a proven track record of success and are targeted at maintaining and growing our current installed base. Our Premium titles include unique and niche titles that provide a distinctive player experience and are targeted at increasing floor space in both existing and new jurisdictions. Specialty titles describe our jumbo games, such as Colossal Diamonds, and games made specifically for high-limit winnings. In total, our development teams have the capabilities to produce approximately 50 games per year. We believe this strategy of producing diversified content will enable us to maintain and grow our market leadership within our current Class II base, as well as continue our expansion into Class III commercial and tribal casinos.
Our Core titles, offered on our ICON cabinet, includes Jade Wins, Golden Wins, Fu Pig, Golden Skulls, Golden Dragon, Red Dragon, Longhorn Jackpots, and the So Hot family of games, which are some of the top-performing Class II games in the market today. We design our Core titles to provide a universal appeal.
Our Premium and Specialty titles, offered on ICON, our Orion family and Big Red, include an assortment of compelling features that maximize the capabilities of their hardware. Top-performing titles include Colossal Diamonds, Fu Nan Fu Nu, Olympus Strikes, and Eastern Dragon. These titles are premium in nature because they include dynamic play mechanics such as Pick ‘em Progressives, Must-Hit-By Progressives, Streaming Stacks, Reel Surges, Free Spin Bonuses, and much more. Their main game features are wrapped inside crisp graphics and sounds that maximize the hardware’s capabilities to provide universal player appeal that helps optimize our customer’s operations.
Table Products 
In addition to our existing portfolio of EGMs, we also offer our customers more than 40 unique table product offerings, including live felt table games, side bet offerings, progressives, signage, and other ancillary table game equipment. Our table products are designed to enhance the table games section of the casino floor (commonly known as “the pit”). Over the past 10 years, there has been a trend of introducing side bets on blackjack tables to increase the game’s overall hold. Our table products segment offers a full suite of side bets and specialty table games that capitalize on this trend, and we believe that this segment will serve as an important growth engine for our company by generating further cross-selling opportunities with our EGM offerings. As of December 31, 2018, we had placed 3,162 table products domestically and internationally and based on the number of products placed, we believe we are presently a leading supplier of table products to the gaming industry.
Our premium game titles include Criss Cross Poker, Chase The Flush, Dai Bacc, and Double Draw Poker, to name a few. This segment of the table product business provides an area for growth and expansion in the marketplace, as the industry’s revenues are currently primarily dominated by a single competitor, and we have recently expanded our sales efforts to cover greater territory. The game mechanics of our proprietary, premium titles take classic public domain games and offer a twist on game play that increases volatility while simultaneously increasing hold for operators. This means players experience larger wins, which keeps them engaged in the games for longer periods of time, and operators have the potential to earn incremental revenue. We also recently acquired five dynamic new games: Super 4 Progressive Blackjack, Blackjack Match Progressive, Jackpot Blackjack, Royal 9, and Jackpot Baccarat. These games have more than 700 installs worldwide and feature a simple, rewarding side bet that extends the winning experience in interactive ways and further engages players.

As one of the fastest-growing bonus bets in the world, Buster Blackjack headlines our side-bets product category, quadrupling its installed base since we acquired the title in 2015. Most recently, Buster Blackjack has been installed at Harrah’s New Orleans Casino and Horseshoe Baltimore Maryland Casino. In addition to Buster Blackjack, we have other top-performing side-bet games such as War Blackjack, In-Bet, Push Your Luck, and Trifecta Blackjack.

 Bonus Spin Blackjack is a first-of-its kind wheel-based table products progressive side-bet solution that uses built-in, light-up bet sensors, a tablet-style dealer interface, and a progressive engine that’s fully customizable. Operators can offer anything from a progressive top prize, a fixed top prize, or an experience-based top prize. Sophisticated 3D graphics and a double-sided display draw players into the game and show prizes, results, and bet limits. By adding Bonus Spin to any of their table products, operators can instantly be more effective at marketing their games by offering customizable prizes that target specific player segments, resulting in more player excitement, interaction, and a potential increase in revenues and visits. In addition, Bonus Spin can be easily added to any of our table products, providing substantial growth opportunities. Bonus Spin was recognized among the Top 20 Most Innovative Gaming & Technology Products Awards of 2017. As of December 31, 2018, and in less than one year since its launch, we have placed more than 250 Bonus Spin units.
In 2018, due to our success with Bonus Spin Blackjack, we formally introduced Bonus Spin Xtreme at the Global Gaming Expo 2018 which we expect will be launched in 2019. This next-generation of Bonus Spin is a progressive side-bet that attracts players with three eye-catching wheels, and offers a community bonus feature that awards secondary prizes to every player who has wagered a side-bet.

Another AGS progressive innovation is STAX, which offers multi-level and must-hit-by progressive jackpots that can be added to basic table games like blackjack, as well as AGS proprietary table games like Criss Cross Poker and Chase the Flush. This game, with it’s eye-catching, colorful display advertising the progressive levels, and the opportunity for players to win more, won the top award for table innovation in the 2019 Gaming & Technology Awards and the Top 20 Most Innovative Gaming & Technology Products Awards of 2017. 
One of the newer areas of our Table Products segment are ancillary equipment offerings to table games, such as card shufflers and table signage, which provide casino operators a greater variety of choice in the marketplace. This product segment includes baccarat signage, animated roulette readerboards, and our highly anticipated single-card shuffler, Dex S, which was approved by our industry’s primary independent testing lab Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) in 2018 and we expect to launch full-scale in early 2019. The Dex S shuffler features a streamlined design with fewer moving parts, making it exceptionally functional, economical, and reliable, and it easily fits into existing table cutouts so casino operators can seamlessly install without changing their current layouts or replacing any tables. We believe that the table equipment area of our business holds many opportunities for growth, as the technology currently installed in the signage and readerboard areas are in a replacement cycle.

Interactive 
Our Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”) social casino games include online versions of our popular EGM titles and are accessible to players worldwide on multiple mobile platforms, which we believe establishes brand recognition and cross-selling opportunities. Our B2C social casino games operate on a free-to-play model, whereby game players may collect virtual currency or other virtual consumable goods (collectively referred to as “virtual goods” or “virtual currency”) free of charge, through the passage of time or through targeted marketing promotions. Additionally, players have the ability to send free “gifts” of virtual goods to their friends through interactions with certain social platforms. If a game player wishes to obtain virtual goods above and beyond the level of free virtual goods available to that player, the player may purchase additional virtual goods. Once obtained, virtual currency (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play. We design our portfolio of B2C games to appeal to the interests of the broad group of people who like to play casino-themed social and mobile games.
Currently, our B2C social casino games consist of our mobile app, Lucky Play Casino. The app contains numerous AGS game titles available for consumers to play for fun or with chips they purchase in the app. Some of our most popular social games include content that is also popular in land-based casinos, such as Fire Wolf, Gold Dragon Red Dragon, Legend of the White Buffalo, Royal Reels, Colossal Diamonds, So Hot, Monkey in the Bank, and many more. Our B2C games leverage the global connectivity and distribution of Facebook, as well as mobile platforms such as the Apple App Store for Apple devices and the Google Play Store for Android devices, which provides a platform to offer our games as well payment processing. 
We have recently expanded into the Business-to-Business (“B2B”) space, whereby we enable our land-based casino customers to brand the social gaming product with their own casino name and brand identity through our Social White-Label Casino (“WLC”) solution. This turn-key, free-to-play mobile casino app solution blends the casino’s brand with AGS’ player-
6

favorite games to strengthen a casino’s relationship with players, provide monetization opportunities while players are off property, reach new players, and incentivize players to return to the casino. To date, five customers are using our Social WLC solution. 
With the acquisition of Gameiom Technologies Limited (formerly known as “Gameiom”, and currently known as “AGS iGaming”) in the current year, we now offer a B2B platform for content aggregation used by RMG and sports-betting partners. Our acquired B2B platform aggregates content from game suppliers and offers on-line casino operators the convenience to reduce the number of integrations that are needed to supply the on-line casino. By integrating with us, on-line casino operators have access to a significant amount of content from several game suppliers. AGS iGaming operates in regulated, legal on-line gaming jurisdictions such as the UK and parts of Europe.
Other Segment Information
Customers and marketing. We market our products to casinos and other legal gaming establishments around the world with our domestic and international sales force and several domestic and international distributors and/or representatives. We believe the quality and breadth of our customer base is a strong testament to the effectiveness and performance of our product offerings, technological innovation, and customer service. Our customer base includes leading casino operators in leading established gaming markets such as the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Our customers include, among others, Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International, Poarch Band of Creek Indians, and the Chickasaw Nation.
Our products and the locations in which we may sell them are subject to the licensing and product approval requirements of various national, state, provincial, and tribal jurisdictional agencies that regulate gaming around the world.  See “Regulation and Licensing” section below. We lease and sell our products, with an emphasis on leasing versus selling. We service the products we lease and offer service packages to customers who purchase products from us.
Product supply. We obtain most of the parts for our products from outside suppliers, including both off-the-shelf items as well as components manufactured to our specifications. We also manufacture parts in-house that are used for product assembly and for servicing existing products. We generally perform warehousing, quality control, final assembly and shipping from our facilities in Las Vegas, Atlanta, Mexico City and Oklahoma City, although small inventories are maintained and repairs are performed by our field service employees. We believe that our sources of supply for components and raw materials are adequate and that alternative sources of materials are available.
Manufacturing
We have manufacturing agreements to build our gaming cabinets with multiple manufacturing vendors. We believe we have limited concentration risk with any one of these vendors, because we own the rights to our cabinet designs and thus have the ability to change manufacturers in the event of a dispute. We believe any of these vendors would be able to build our gaming cabinets for titles on any platform. As the supplier base is large, we are able to gain competitive pricing and delivery on any of our cabinets and have limited risk in supply disruptions. Manufacturing commitments are generally based on projected quarterly demand from customers.
Our primary EGM production facility is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Production at this facility includes assembling and refurbishing gaming machines (excluding gaming cabinets), parts support and purchasing. We also assemble EGMs at our Las Vegas, Nevada and Mexico City, Mexico facilities at lower volumes to support the Nevada, California and Mexican markets, respectively. System production is based at our Atlanta, Georgia office, where our system design team and our U.S. research and development team are based. Table games products are primarily manufactured in our Las Vegas, Nevada facility, with the exception of the Dex S shuffler, which is produced in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Field service technicians are located in various jurisdictions throughout the United States and Mexico and are dispatched from centralized call centers. They are responsible for installing, maintaining and servicing the electronic gaming machines, table games and systems.
Customers
We believe the quality and breadth of our customer base is a strong testament to the effectiveness and quality of our product offerings, technological innovation and customer service. At the core of our relationship with our customers is our participation model, which aligns our financial incentives with those of our customers through a shared dependence on the games’ performance. The combination of our customer-aligned participation model, quality customer service and strong game performance has allowed us to develop long-term relationships with our tribal and commercial casino customers. Our top
7

participation customers have been with us for more than a decade, and we believe that we maintain long-term relationships with key customer decision-makers.
We have historically offered select existing and prospective customers an upfront payment, or placement fee, in exchange for exclusive rights to a percentage of their floor space. To a lesser extent, we have offered financing for casino development and expansion projects. In addition to our long-term relationships and contractual arrangements, the consistent demand for our games from the loyal, repeat players of our games further ensures our strong presence on our customers’ casino floors.
Within the Native American tribal market, we provide both Class II and Class III games. We also serve customers in commercial, video lottery terminal, charity bingo and route-based markets.
Oklahoma is our largest market and our EGMs in the state accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our largest customer is the Chickasaw Nation, a Native American gaming operator in Oklahoma, which accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The revenues we earn from the Chickasaw Nation are derived from numerous agreements, which are scheduled for renewal in 2019, but which we would expect to renew.
Alabama is our second largest domestic market and our EGMs in the state accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians, a Native American gaming operator in Alabama, is our second largest customer and accounted for approximately 9% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not receive more than 10% of our total revenue from any of our other customers.
Customer Contracts
We derive the majority of our gaming revenues from participation agreements, whereby we place EGMs and systems, along with our proprietary and other licensed game content, at a customer’s facility in return for either a share of the revenues that these EGMs and systems generate or a daily fee. For licensed table products and related equipment, we typically receive monthly royalty payments. We measure the performance of our domestic installed base of participation EGMs on the net win per day per machine, often referred to as the win per day, or “WPD”. Under our participation agreements, we earn a percentage of the win per day of our domestic installed base of participation EGMs. 
Our standard contracts are one to three years in duration and may contain auto-renewal provisions for an additional term. Our contracts generally specify the number of EGMs and other equipment to be provided, revenue share, daily fee or other pricing, provisions regarding installation, training, service and removal of the machines, and other terms and conditions standard in the industry. In some circumstances, we enter into trial agreements with customers that provide a free or fee-based trial period, during which such customers may use our EGMs or table products. Each trial agreement lays out the terms of payment should the customer decide to continue using our machines.
The Company enters into development agreements and placement fee agreements with certain customers to secure floor space under lease agreements for its gaming machines. Amounts paid in connection with the development agreements are repaid to the Company in accordance with the terms of the agreement, whereas placements fees are not reimbursed. For development agreements in the form of a loan, interest income is recognized on the repayment of the loan based on the stated rate or, if not stated explicitly in the development agreement, on an imputed interest rate. If the stated interest rate is deemed to be other than a market rate or zero, a discount is recorded on the loan receivable as a result of the difference between the stated and market rate and a corresponding intangible asset is recorded. These agreements have typically been longer-term contracts, ranging from four to seven years depending on the amount of financing provided, market, and other factors. 
We generally make efforts to obtain waivers of sovereign immunity in our contracts with Native American customers. However, we do not always obtain these provisions and when we do, they can be limited in scope. There is no guarantee that we will continue or improve our ability to get this term in future contracts. While we have not had any experience with contract enforceability vis-à-vis our Native American customers, we are cognizant of recent cases involving other parties dealing with waivers of sovereign immunity. Those cases put into question how sovereign immunity may be viewed by courts in the future. In the event that we enter into contracts with Native American customers in the future that do not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity, such contracts may be practically unenforceable.
Our game sale contracts are typical of those in the industry. They specify the general terms and conditions of the sale, equipment and services to be provided, as well as pricing and payment terms. In some cases, we provide the central server that is 
8

used to operate the purchased equipment on a lease and charge a fee-per-day based on the number of gaming machines connected to the server.
For our interactive segment, we enter into agreements whereby revenues are generated from (1) B2C social products where customers purchase virtual coins to play social casino games, (2) B2B social products where we obtain a percentage of monthly revenue generated by the white label casino apps that we build and operate for our customers, and (3) B2B RMG revenues which are earned primarily based on a percentage of the revenue produced by the games on our game aggregation platform that we provide to certain on-line RMG operators as well as monthly platform fees and initial integration fees.
Research and Development
We conduct research and development through an internal team to develop new gaming systems and gaming content. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, travel and expenses and other professional services. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred research and development costs of $31.7 million, $25.7 million and $21.3 million, respectively. We employ 246 game developers, software and system programmers, project managers and other development and administrative staff that oversee internal game development efforts and manage third party relationships. The technology and game development division for the EGM segment operates primarily out of our Atlanta, Georgia, Austin, Texas and Sydney, Australia locations as well as a studio in Las Vegas, Nevada that primarily supports our Table Products segment. We also have development and support teams for our Interactive segment in Tel Aviv, Israel. Additionally, we hire independent contractors in the Ukraine to support the on-line operations of AGS iGaming. The Company does not have customer-sponsored research and development costs.

Intellectual Property
We use a combination of internally developed and third-party intellectual property, all of which we believe maintain and enhance our competitive position and protect our products. Such intellectual property includes owned or licensed patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trademark applications in the United States. In addition, we have rights in intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions. Some of these rights, however, are shared with other third parties, including in an industry wide manufacturers’ patent pool. Additionally, pursuant to our license agreements with third-party game developers, we license and distribute gaming software. We also have pooling arrangements with third parties, whereby all parties to such arrangement are permitted to use certain intellectual property contributed to the pool.
Competition
We encounter competition from other designers, manufacturers and operators of electronic gaming machines, table products, social casino and real-money gaming games. Our competitors range from small, localized companies to large, multi-national corporations, several of which have substantial resources and market share.
Our competitors for the live casino floor gaming machines include, but are not limited to, International Game Technology PLC (“IGT”), Scientific Games Corporation (“Scientific Games”), Aristocrat Technologies Inc. (“Aristocrat”), Everi Holdings Inc. (“Everi”), Konami Co. Ltd. (“Konami”), Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd., and Galaxy Gaming, Inc. Additionally, there are hundreds of non-gaming companies that design and develop social casino games and apps and real-money gaming products and services. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources and have been engaged in the design, manufacture and operation of gaming products for many years. Some of these companies contain significant intellectual property including patents in gaming technology and hardware design, systems and game play and trademarks. In addition, the larger competitors contain significantly larger content portfolios and content development capability and resources, are licensed in markets throughout the United States, and have international distribution. IGT, Scientific Games, Aristocrat, and Konami all have a presence in the back-office accounting and player tracking business which expands their relationship with casino customers. Aristocrat and Everi are our primary competitors in the Class II market.
To compete effectively, we must, among other things, continue to develop high-performing, innovative games for the Class II and Class III markets, provide excellent service and support to our existing customers, effectively manage our installed base of participation gaming machines, expand our library of proprietary content, develop niche products with strong appeal to both local and next-generation players, be first to market in new non-traditional markets, implement effective marketing and sales functions, and offer competitive pricing and terms on our participation and sale agreements.
Seasonality
We experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from quarter to quarter, as our operating results have been highest during the first and second quarters and lowest in our third and fourth quarters, primarily due to the seasonality of player demand. These fluctuations, however, do not have a material impact on our revenues and cash flows.
Inflation
Our operations have not been, nor are they expected to be in the future, materially affected by inflation. However, our operational expansion is affected by the cost of hardware components, which are not considered to be inflation sensitive, but rather, sensitive to changes in technology and competition in the hardware markets. In addition, we expect to continue to incur increased legal and other similar costs associated with regulatory compliance requirements and the uncertainties present in the operating environment in which we conduct our business.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had over 678 full-time equivalent employees, with approximately 169 employed internationally and approximately 509 employed domestically. 

We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements in the United States and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in the past.
Regulation and Licensing
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
10

We operate in numerous gaming jurisdictions, and our business operations, which include the manufacture, sale, and distribution, of gaming devices, gaming related equipment, related software and/or the provision of gaming related services, are subject to extensive federal, state, local, tribal and foreign government regulation as applicable in each of the gaming jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant portion of our operations take place at facilities conducting gaming activities on the tribal lands of Native American tribes resulting in our operations being subject to tribal and/or federal and sometimes state regulation depending on the classification of gaming being conducted in each such case as defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”). In states where commercial gaming has been legalized, our operations are conducted subject to the applicable federal, state, and local government regulation.
While the specific regulatory requirements of the various jurisdictions vary, the gaming laws in most jurisdictions require us, each of our subsidiaries engaged in manufacturing, selling and distributing gaming products and services, our directors, officers and employees and, in some cases, certain entities or individuals who hold some level of beneficial ownership, typically 5% or more, in the Company or its affiliates as well as our lenders and other individuals or entities affiliated with us (contractually or otherwise) to obtain a license, permit, finding of suitability or other approval from gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable and the burden of demonstrating suitability and the cost of the investigation is the responsibility of the applicant. While the criteria vary between jurisdictions, generally, in determining whether to grant or renew a license, the gaming authorities will consider the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant and the financial ability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant. For individual applicants, gaming authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates. Qualification and suitability determinations for individuals requires the individual to submit detailed personal and financial information to the gaming authority, followed by a thorough background investigation. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing or a determination of suitability for any cause which they deem reasonable. If one or more gaming authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable to participate in the gaming industry in such jurisdiction, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person. Additionally, gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. The gaming regulators having jurisdiction over us have broad power over our business operations and may deny, revoke, suspend, condition, limit, or not renew our gaming or other licenses, permits or approvals, impose substantial fines and take other action, any one of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. We believe we and our officers, directors, managers, key employees and affiliates have obtained or are in the process of obtaining all required gaming related licenses, permits, findings of suitability and other forms of approvals necessary to carry on our business.
It is common for gaming regulators to monitor, or to require us to disclose, our activities and any disciplinary actions against us in other gaming jurisdictions. Consequently, the business activities or disciplinary actions taken against us in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary actions in other jurisdictions.
Licensing Requirements of Security Holders
In some jurisdictions in which we operate, certain of our stockholders or holders of our debt securities may be required to undergo a suitability determination or background investigation. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities, generally 5% or more, to report the acquisition of the ownership interest and the gaming authorities may require such holder to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Most jurisdictions allow an “institutional investor” to apply for a waiver from such requirements provided that the institutional investor holds the ownership interest in the ordinary course of its business and for passive investment purposes only. Generally, an “institutional investor” includes an investor who is a bank, insurance company, investment company, investment advisor, or pension fund. In some jurisdictions, an application for a waiver as an institutional investor requires the submission of detailed information concerning the institutional investor and its business including, among other things, the name of each person that beneficially owns more than 5% of the voting securities of such institutional investor. If such a waiver is granted, then the institutional investor may acquire, in most cases, up to 10% of our voting securities without applying for a finding of suitability or qualification and, in some cases, a higher percentage of beneficial ownership. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver is granted without becoming subject to a suitability determination or background investigation. A change in the investment intent of the institutional investor requires immediate reporting to the respective gaming authorities.
Notwithstanding the 5% ownership threshold, gaming authorities have broad discretion and each person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of any voting security or beneficial or record ownership of any nonvoting security of any debt security of ours may be required to be found suitable if a gaming authority has reason to believe that such person’s acquisition of that ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policy of the jurisdiction.
11

Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period of time after being advised that such a finding or license is required by a gaming authority may be denied a license or be found unsuitable. The same restrictions may also apply to a record owner if the record owner, after being requested, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person denied a license or found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership interest in us beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable gaming authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. Additionally, we may be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have a relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we:

• | pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities;


• | allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;


• | pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or


• | fail to pursue all lawful efforts to terminate our relationship with that person including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of said voting securities for cash at fair market value.

In light of these regulations and their potential impact on our business, our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions establishing our right to redeem the securities of disqualified holders if necessary to avoid any regulatory sanctions, to prevent the loss or to secure the reinstatement of any license, permit or approval, or if such holder is determined by any gaming authority to be unsuitable, has an application for a license or permit denied or rejected or has a previously issued license or permit rescinded, suspended, revoked or not renewed. The amended and restated articles of incorporation also include provisions defining the redemption price of such securities and the rights of a disqualified security holder.
Testing and Approvals of our Gaming Products
Many jurisdictions require our gaming devices, related gaming equipment, software, and platform to be tested for compliance with the jurisdiction’s technical standards and regulations prior to our being permitted to distribute such devices, equipment, software and platform. The gaming authorities will conduct rigorous testing of our devices, equipment, software and platform through a testing laboratory which may be operated by the gaming authority or by an independent third party and may require a field trial of the device, equipment, software or platform before determining that it meets the gaming authority’s technical standards. As part of the approval process, a gaming authority may require us to modify, update, or revise our device, equipment, software or platform and the approval process may require several rounds before approval is ultimately granted. The time required for product testing can be extensive.
Continued Reporting and Monitoring
In most jurisdictions, even though we are licensed or approved, we remain under the on-going obligation to provide financial information and reports as well as to keep the applicable gaming authorities informed of any material changes in the information provided to them as part of our licensing and approval process. All licenses and approvals must be periodically renewed, in some cases as often as annually. In connection with any initial application or renewal of a gaming license or approval, we (and individuals or entities required to submit to background investigations or suitability determinations in connection with our application or renewal) are typically required to make broad and comprehensive disclosures concerning our history, finances, ownership and corporate structure, operations, compliance controls and business relationships. We must regularly report changes in our officers, key employees and other licensed positions to applicable gaming authorities.
Most gaming jurisdictions impose fees and taxes that are payable by us in connection with our application, maintenance and renewal of our licensure or our approval to conduct business. Laws, regulations, and ordinances governing our gaming related activities and the obligations of gaming companies in any jurisdiction in which we have or in the future may have gaming operations are subject to change that could impose additional operating, financial, or other burdens on our business.
Federal Registration
The Gambling Devices Act of 1962 makes it unlawful for a person to manufacture, transport, or receive gaming devices (including our products), or components across interstate lines unless that person has first registered with the Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice. This act also imposes gambling device identification and record keeping requirements. Violation of this act may result in seizure and forfeiture of the equipment, as well as other penalties. As an entity involved in the manufacture and transportation of gaming devices, we are required to register annually.
Native American Gaming Regulation
12

Gaming on Native American lands is governed by federal law, tribal-state compacts, and tribal gaming regulations. Federally, gaming on Native American lands is subject to “the IGRA”, which is administered by the National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”). Under the IGRA, gaming activities conducted by federally recognized Native American tribes are segmented into three classes:

• | Class I, Class II and Class III.

Class I. Class I gaming represents traditional forms of Native American gaming as part of, or in connection with, tribal ceremonies or celebrations (e.g., contests and games of skill) and social gaming for minimal prizes. Class I gaming is regulated only by each individual Native American tribe. We do not participate in any Class I gaming activities.
Class II. Class II gaming involves the game of chance commonly known as bingo (whether or not electronic, computer, or other technological aids are used in connection therewith to facilitate play) and if played in the same location as bingo, also includes pull tabs, punch board, tip jars, instant bingo, and other games similar to bingo. Class II gaming also includes non-banked card games, that is, games that are played exclusively against other players rather than against the house or a player acting as a bank such as poker. However, the definition of Class II gaming specifically excludes slot machines or electronic facsimiles of Class III games. Class II gaming is regulated by the NIGC and the ordinances and regulations of the Native American tribe conducting such gaming. Subject to the detailed requirements of the IGRA, including NIGC approval of such Native American tribe’s gaming ordinance, federally recognized Native American tribes are typically permitted to conduct Class II gaming on Indian lands pursuant to tribal ordinances approved by the NIGC.
Class III. Class III gaming includes all other forms of gaming that are neither Class I nor Class II and includes a broad range of traditional casino games such as slot machines, blackjack, craps and roulette, as well as wagering games and electronic facsimiles of any game of chance. The IGRA generally permits a Native American tribe to conduct Class III gaming activities on reservation lands subject to the detailed requirements of the IGRA and provided that the Native American tribe has entered into a written agreement or compact with the state that specifically authorizes the types of Class III gaming the tribe may offer. The tribal-state compacts vary from state to state. Many such tribal-state compacts address the manner and extent to which the state or tribe will license manufacturers and suppliers of gaming devices and conduct background investigations and certify the suitability of persons such as officers, directors, key persons and, in some cases, shareholders of gaming device manufacturers and suppliers.
The IGRA is administered by the NIGC and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The NIGC has authority to issue regulations related to tribal gaming activities, approve tribal ordinances for regulating gaming, approve management agreements for gaming facilities, conduct investigations and monitor tribal gaming generally. The IGRA is subject to interpretation by the NIGC and may be subject to judicial and legislative clarification or amendment. The gaming ordinance of each Native American tribe conducting gaming under the IGRA and the terms of any applicable tribal-state compact establish the regulatory requirements under which we must conduct business on Native American tribal lands.
Under the IGRA, the NIGC’s authority to approve gaming-related contracts is limited to management contracts and collateral agreements related to management contracts. A “management contract” includes any agreement between a Native American tribe and a contractor if such contract or agreement provides for the management of all or part of a gaming operation. To the extent that any of our agreements with Native American tribes are deemed to be management contracts, such agreements would require the approval of the NIGC in order to be valid. To our knowledge, none of our current agreements with Native American tribes qualify as management contracts under the IGRA
In addition, to the extent that any of our agreements with Native American tribes are deemed by the NIGC to create an impermissible proprietary interest, such agreements are void and unenforceable. To our knowledge, none of our current agreements with Native American tribes create an impermissible proprietary interest in Indian gaming.
International Regulation
Certain foreign countries permit the importation, sale, and operation of gaming equipment, software and related equipment in casino and non-casino environments. Some countries prohibit or restrict the payout feature of the traditional slot machine or limit the operation and the number of slot machines to a controlled number of casinos or casino-like locations. Gaming equipment must comply with the individual country’s regulations. Certain jurisdictions do not require the licensing of gaming equipment operators and manufacturers. In Mexico, for example, gaming regulations have not been formalized and although we believe that we are compliant with the current informal regulations, if there are changes or new interpretations of the regulations in that jurisdiction we may be prevented or hindered from operating our business in Mexico.
Social Gaming Regulation
13

With respect to our social interactive gaming business, it is largely unregulated at this time. There are, however, movements in some jurisdictions to review social interactive gaming and possibly implement social interactive gaming regulations. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any such regulation or the extent to which any such regulation would affect our social interactive gaming business.
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws that affect our interactive business including those relating to the privacy and security of our customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, sweepstakes and contests. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which would result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers or deliver our products and services or may significantly increase our costs of compliance.
