 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
  
 As used in this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our,” “FitLife,” “FitLife Brands” “Company” or “our company” refers to FitLife Brands, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.
 Overview
  
 FitLife Brands, Inc. is a national provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health-conscious consumers marketed under the brand names NDS Nutrition Products™ (www.ndsnutrition.com), PMD™ (www.pmdsports.com), SirenLabs™ (www.sirenlabs.com), CoreActive™ (www.coreactivenutrition.com), and Metis Nutrition™ (www.metisnutrition.com) (together, “NDS Products”). With the consummation of the merger with iSatori, Inc. (“iSatori”) on September 30, 2015, which became effective on October 1, 2015, described below (the “Merger”), the Company added three brands to its product portfolio, including iSatori (www.isatori.com), BioGenetic Laboratories, and Energize (together, “iSatori Products”). The NDS Products are distributed principally through franchised General Nutrition Centers, Inc. (“GNC”) stores located both domestically and internationally, and, with the launch of Metis Nutrition, through corporate GNC stores in the United States. The iSatori Products are sold through more than 25,000 retail locations, which include specialty, mass, and online.
  
 The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 26, 2005. In October 2008, the Company acquired the assets of NDS Nutritional Products, Inc., a Nebraska corporation, and moved those assets into its wholly owned subsidiary NDS Nutrition Products, Inc., a Florida corporation (“NDS”). The Company’s NDS Products are sold through NDS and the iSatori Products are sold through iSatori, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
  
 On September 30, 2015, the Company consummated the Merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 18, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”), among the Company, ISFL Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and iSatori, pursuant to which iSatori merged with and into Merger Sub, with iSatori surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger was approved by iSatori shareholders at a special meeting held on September 29, 2015 and became effective on October 1, 2015. 
  
 FitLife Brands is headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. For more information on the Company, please go to http://www.fitlifebrands.com. The Company’s common stock currently trades under the symbol “FTLF” on the OTC:PINK market.
  
  Recent Developments
  
  Withdrawal of Former Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series C Preferred
  
  On November 13, 2018, the Company filed Certificates of Withdrawal with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada for its (i) Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) 10% Cumulative Perpetual Series B Preferred Stock, and (iii) Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, none of which were issued and outstanding, thereby withdrawing each of the series of preferred stock and returning all previously designated shares to their status as authorized preferred stock available for issuance.
 Creation of a New Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
  
 On November 13, 2018, the Company filed a new Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, designating 1,000 shares of the Company’s authorized preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value (the “Series A Preferred”). Shares of the Series A Preferred have a stated value of $1,000 per share (“Stated Value”), subject to certain adjustments, and accrue dividends annually at a rate of 12%, which dividends compound monthly and shall be paid quarterly, at the Company’s election, in either cash or shall accrue and increase the Stated Value of the Series A Preferred. Shares of the Series A Preferred rank senior to the Company’s common stock.
  
 
   
-1-



 
 
 Each share of the Series A Preferred has a liquidation preference equal to the Stated Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the “Liquidation Preference”), and is convertible into that number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the Liquidation Preference divided by $0.46 (the “Conversion Shares”). Holders of Series A Preferred may elect to convert shares of Series A Preferred into Conversion Shares at any time. The Company, at its sole option, may choose to redeem all or a portion of Series A Preferred at any time for 115% of the Liquidation Preference per share (the “Redemption Price”); provided, however, in the event of a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designations), the Company shall be required to redeem all issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred for the Redemption Price.
  
 Holders of Series A Preferred have the right to vote, on an as-converted basis, with the holders of the Company’s common stock on any matter presented to the Company’s stockholders for their action or consideration. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred remain outstanding, holders of the Series A Preferred have the right to elect one director to the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) (the “Series A Director”); provided, however, so long as Dayton Judd remains on the Company’s Board, he shall be deemed to be the Series A Director. Furthermore, so long as any shares of Series A Preferred remain outstanding, the Company may not, without the affirmative vote or consent of at least 50% of the shares of issued and outstanding Series A Preferred on such date, voting as a separate class, (i) authorize, create, issue or alter any class of debt or equity securities ranking pari passu or senior to the Series A Preferred; (ii) amend provisions of the Series A Preferred; (iii) repurchase, redeem or pay dividends on any class of junior securities, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) amend the Company’s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws in any way that will have a material adverse effect on the rights of the Series A Preferred; (v) after February 16, 2019, increase the size of the Board to more than five members; (vi) take any action that would constitute a Fundamental Transaction (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designations); or (vii) incur any additional indebtedness other than through the Company’s Merchant Agreement, any other line of credit with Compass or under any similar replacement facility.
  
 In addition, holders of the Series A Preferred shall have certain piggyback registration rights for the first two years following November 13, 2018, and certain demand registration rights thereafter, as more specifically set forth in the Certificate of Designations.
  
  Series A Preferred Financing
  
 On November 13, 2018, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain accredited investors (each, a “Purchaser” and together, the “Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Company offered and sold to the Purchasers an aggregate of 600 units (“Units”) for $1,000 per Unit, with each Unit consisting of one share of Series A Preferred and a warrant to purchase that number of shares of Company common stock equal to 30% of the shares of Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred purchased by the Purchaser (“Warrant”) (the “Offering”). The Warrants shall expire five years from the date of issuance, and are exercisable at a price of $0.46 per share. Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 391,304 shares of Company common stock were issued in the Offering.
  
  The Offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $600,000. Purchasers in the Offering included Dayton Judd, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Grant Dawson, a director. A portion of the Offering was also sold to an unaffiliated third party.
  
  Termination of Merchant Agreement
  
 In December 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, NDS and iSatori (together, the “Subsidiaries”), entered into a Merchant Agreement (the “Merchant Agreement”) with Compass Bank, d/b/a Commercial Billing Service (“Compass”). Under the terms of the Merchant Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to funding, the Subsidiaries agreed to sell to Compass, and Compass agreed to purchase from the Subsidiaries, certain accounts owing from customers of such Subsidiaries, including GNC.
  
 On December 4, 2018, the Company received a notice of termination (the “Termination Notice”) of the Merchant Agreement. Pursuant to the Termination Notice, Compass indicated it would discontinue purchasing accounts from the Subsidiaries as of February 26, 2019. Under the terms of the Termination Notice, the Merchant Agreement would remain in full effect for all transactions occurring on or prior to February 26, 2019, and pursuant to terms in the Merchant Agreement, all security interests would continue until all obligations to Compass under the Merchant Agreement were paid in full.
  
 Subsequent to the receipt of the notice of termination and as of December 31, 2018, the Company has settled all outstanding obligations to Compass. Furthermore, no additional transactions occurred with Compass under this agreement subsequent to December 31, 2018 and up to the termination of the agreement on February 26, 2019.

  Entry into New Line of Credit
 
 On December 26, 2018, the Company issued a line of credit promissory note to Sudbury Capital Fund, LP (“Sudbury”) in the principal amount of $600,000 (the “Sudbury Note”), with an initial advance to the Company in the amount of $300,000. In addition, on December 26, 2018, the Company also issued a promissory note to Dayton Judd, in the principal amount of $200,000 (the “Judd Note”) (together with the Sudbury Note, the “Notes”). All amounts due and payable under the terms of the Notes are guaranteed by the Subsidiaries.
 
 The Notes mature on the earlier to occur of a Change in Control of the Company, as defined in the Notes, or December 31, 2019, and require monthly principal and interest payments beginning April 1, 2019, with a final payment of unpaid principal and interest due December 31, 2019. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.0% per annum. Interest due under the terms of the Notes may be paid in cash or, up to and including March 31, 2019, can be accrued and added to the outstanding principal and accrued interest due and payable under the terms of the Notes.
 
 Proceeds from the sale of the Notes, along with existing cash balances, were used to retire all outstanding indebtedness under the terms of the Merchant Agreement, totaling approximately $590,000 at December 26, 2018.
 
 Dayton Judd, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is affiliated with Sudbury. The Notes were approved by the independent members of the Board of Directors.
  
  Industry Overview
  
                 We compete principally in the nutrition industry. The Nutrition Business Journal categorizes the industry in the following segments:
  
  ●
  Natural & Organic Foods (products such as cereals, milk, non-dairy beverages and frozen meals);

 
  ●
  Functional Foods (products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes);

 
  ●
  Natural & Organic Personal Care and Household Products; and

 
  ●
  Supplements (products focused on sports nutrition and weight management).

 
     Management believes that the following factors drive growth in the nutrition industry:
  
  ●
  The general public’s awareness and understanding of the connection between diet and health;

 
  ●
  The aging population in the Company’s markets who tend to use more nutritional supplements as they age;

 
  ●
  Increasing healthcare costs and the consequential trend toward preventative medicine and non-traditional medicines; and

 
  ●
  Product introductions in response to new scientific studies.

 
  Our Products
  
                 The Company currently focuses its sales and marketing efforts on its full line of sports, weight loss and general nutrition products that are currently marketed and sold both nationally and internationally.

  Manufacturing, Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
  
 All of the Company’s products are manufactured by FDA-regulated contract manufacturers within the United States and Canada. Each contract manufacturer is required by the Company to abide by current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) to ensure quality and consistency, and to manufacture its products according to the Company’s strict specifications, and nearly all our contract manufacturers are certified through a governing body such as the NPA (“Natural Products Association”) or NSF International. In most cases, contract manufacturers purchase the raw materials based on the Company’s specifications; however, from time to time, the Company will license particular raw material ingredients and supply its own source to the manufacturer. Once produced, in addition to in-house testing performed by the contract manufacturer, the Company may also perform independent analysis and testing. The contract manufacturer either ships the finished product to one of our fulfillment centers, or directly to our distributors. The Company has implemented vendor qualification programs for all of its suppliers and manufacturers, including analytical testing of purchased products. As part of the vendor program, the Company also periodically inspects vendors’ facilities to monitor quality control and assurance procedures.

  Product Reformulations and New Product Identification
  
 From time to time we reformulate existing products to address market developments and trends, and to respond to customer requests. We also continually expand our product line through the development of new products. New product ideas are derived from a number of sources, including trade publications, scientific and health journals, consultants, distributors, and other third parties. Prior to reformulating existing products or introducing new products, we investigate product formulations as they relate to regulatory compliance and other issues. We introduced a total of 18 new products during the year ended December 31, 2018, which included 6 completely new products, and 12 product reformulations and flavor extensions. We anticipate launching a similar number of new and reformulated products during 2019 across all brands.
  
 Management continually assesses and analyzes developing market trends to detect and proactively address what they believe are areas of unmet or growing demand that represent an opportunity for the Company and, where deemed appropriate, attempt to introduce new products and/or packaging solutions in direct response to meet that demand.
  
  Sales, Marketing and Distribution
  
  NDS Products
  
 NDS Products are sold through more than 1,000 GNC franchise locations located throughout the United States. The Company also currently distributes NDS Products to over 1,000 GNC international franchise locations in more than 26 foreign countries. On May 1, 2014, the Company transitioned the majority of its distribution of NDS Products to GNC’s centralized distribution platform for all NDS Products, excluding protein products, which transitioned in mid-September 2014. Prior to the change, the majority of the Company’s revenue was realized upon direct shipment of NDS Products to individual franchise locations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the vast majority of NDS Product sales were through GNC’s centralized distribution platform.
  
 Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to expand sales of NDS Products to additional GNC franchise locations both domestically and internationally. In addition, we are in the process of relaunching our Core Active brand as a new online-exclusive brand. The GNC domestic franchise market remains a strong business and the core of our operations. Management is committed to continue to work collaboratively with the franchisees to build on our established track records of growth and innovation.
  
  iSatori Products
  
 iSatori Products are distributed directly to consumers through its websites, as well as through wholesalers, specialty, online-only, grocery, convenience, drug and mass-market distribution channels. iSatori products are currently sold in over 25,000 retail locations.
  
 In some cases, iSatori utilizes independent brokers, who work in conjunction with iSatori’s experienced sales employees and management to oversee the grocery, drug and mass market channels. iSatori sells its products to mass-market merchandisers either directly or through distributors of nutritional supplement products. In addition to the Company’s own online distribution direct to consumers, major iSatori customers include BodyBuilding.com, CVS, Europa Sports, GNC, Rite Aid, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, Walgreens and Wal-Mart.
  
 iSatori’s core strategy is to build and strengthen brands among consumers seeking nutritional supplement products with a reputation for quality and innovation. iSatori utilizes social media campaigns, coupons, radio, and online advertising, plus cooperative and other incentive programs, to build consumer awareness and generate trial and repeat purchases to drive sales revenue. Our marketing team regularly reviews the media mix for its effectiveness in creating consumer demand and the highest return on investment dollars.

  Product Returns
  
 We currently have a 30-day product return policy for NDS Products, which allows for a 100% sales price refund, less a 20% restocking fee, for the return of unopened and undamaged products purchased from us online through one of our websites. Product sold to GNC may be returned from store shelves or the distribution center in the event the product is damaged, short dated, expired or recalled. GNC maintains a customer satisfaction program that allows customers to return product to the store for credit or refund. Subject to certain terms and restrictions, GNC may require reimbursement from vendors for unsaleable returned product through either direct payment or credit against a future invoice. We also support a product return policy for iSatori Products, whereby customers can return product for credit or refund. Product returns can and do occur from time to time, and can be material.
 Competition
  
 The nutrition industry is highly competitive, and the Company has many competitors that sell products similar to the Company’s products. Many of the Company’s competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than our own. The Company seeks to differentiate its products and marketing from its competitors based on product quality, benefits, and functional ingredients. Patent and trademark applications that cover new formulas and embody new technologies are, and will be, pursued whenever possible. While we cannot assure that such measures will block competitive products, we believe our continued emphasis on innovation and new product development targeted at the needs of the consumer will enable the Company to effectively compete in the marketplace.
 Regulatory Matters
  
 Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the U.S., including the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Various agencies of the states and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:
  
  ●
  product claims and advertising;

 
  ●
  product labels;

 
  ●
  product ingredients; and

 
  ●
  how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell, and store our products.

 
 The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the U.S., while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. In August 2007, a new rule issued by the FDA went into effect requiring companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements to meet cGMPs to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA and believe we are currently operating within the FDA mandated cGMPs.
  
 The FDA also regulates the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements and nutritional products, including the following:
  
  ●
  the identification of dietary supplements or nutritional products and their nutrition and ingredient labeling;

 
  ●
  requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support;

 
  ●
  labeling requirements for dietary supplements or nutritional products for which “high potency” and “antioxidant” claims are made;

 
  ●
  notification procedures for statements on dietary supplements or nutritional products; and

 
  ●
  premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements.

 The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements, and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status.
  
 DSHEA also permits statements of nutritional support to be included in labeling for nutritional supplements without FDA premarket approval. These statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing and must bear a label disclosure that includes the following: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” These statements may describe a benefit related to a nutrient deficiency disease, the role of a nutrient or nutritional ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or the general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a nutritional supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. An entity that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a disease claim for a food product, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we will be prevented from using the claim. 
  
 In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature,” for example a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular nutritional ingredient with health benefits, may be used in connection with the sale of a nutritional supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of nutritional supplement; the literature must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the nutritional supplement; if displayed in an establishment, the literature must be physically separate from the nutritional supplement; and the literature may not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating it with our products, and any dissemination could subject our products to regulatory action as an illegal drug. Moreover, any written or verbal representation by us that would associate a nutrient in a product that we sell with an effect on a disease will be deemed evidence of intent to sell the product as an unapproved new drug, a violation of the FDCA. 
  
 In December 2006, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (“DSNDCPA”) was passed, which further revised the provisions of the FDCA. Under the act, manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement or nonprescription drug are required to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and are required to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. Events reported to the FDA would not be considered an admission from a company that its product caused or contributed to the reported event. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the requirements of the DSNDCPA.
  
 We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the U.S., including those relating to bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, the environment, and intellectual property. All of these regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so.
  
 Our operations outside the U.S. are similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate and in which our products are sold. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the U.S. and may vary from country to country. The sale of our products in certain European countries is subject to the rules and regulations of the European Union, which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the European Union. In other markets outside the U.S., we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses or certifications from a country’s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned on the reformulation of our products for a particular market or may be unavailable for certain products or product ingredients. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the U.S. Similar to the costs of regulatory compliance in the U.S., foreign regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. Our failure to maintain regulatory compliance within and outside the U.S. could impact our ability to sell our products, and thus, materially impact our financial position and results of operations.

  Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
  
 The Company regards intellectual property, including its trademarks, service marks, website URLs (domains) and other proprietary rights, as valuable assets and part of its revered brand equity. The Company believes that protecting such intellectual property is crucial to its business strategy. The Company pursues registration of the registrable trademarks, service marks and patents, associated with its key products in the United States, Canada, Europe and other places it distributes its products.
  
 The Company formulates its products using proprietary ingredient formulations, flavorings and delivery systems. To further protect its product formulations and flavors, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers that provide exclusivity to certain products formulations and delivery technologies. When appropriate, the Company will seek to protect its research and development efforts by filing patent applications for proprietary product technologies or ingredient combinations. We have abandoned or not pursued efforts to register certain other patents and marks identifying other items in our product line for various reasons, including the inability of some names to qualify for registration or patent applications to qualify for patent protection, and due to our abandonment of certain of such products. All trademark registrations are protected for a period of ten years and then are renewable thereafter if still in use.
  
  Employees
  
 We had 26 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company retains consultants for certain services on an as needed basis. We consider our employee relations to be good.
 Environmental Regulation
  
 Our business does not require us to comply with any particular environmental regulations.
