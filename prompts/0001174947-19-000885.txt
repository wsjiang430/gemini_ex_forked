--------+---------

 
IEH Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) was organized under the laws of the State of New York on March 22, 1943 under the name Industrial Heat Treating Company, Inc. On March 15, 1989, the Company changed its name to its current name. The Company’s executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located at 140 58th Street, Suite 8E, Brooklyn, New York 11220. The Company’s telephone number is (718) 492-4440; Fax: 718-492-9898; its email address is ieh@iehcorp.com.
 
The majority of our customers require that we maintain a quality system in strict accordance with ISO 9001. This is an International Standard Organization (ISO) specification and we have been recently audited and have received certification to ISO 9001:2015. Our quality policy is: “Listening to our Customers and Meeting their Needs, while Continuously Improving our Processes and Services.”
 
The Company has developed a web site that reflects the standard catalog items produced along with custom offerings. New product lines currently under development will be added later this year. You can view it by going to: http://www.iehcorp.com.
 
The Company designs, develops and manufactures printed circuit board connectors and custom interconnects for high performance applications. All of our connectors utilize the HYPERBOLOID contact design, a rugged, high-reliability contact system ideally suited for high-stress environments. We believe we are the only independent producer of HYPERBOLOID printed circuit board connectors in the United States.
 
Our customers consist of OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and distributors who resell our products to OEMs. We sell our products directly and through 25 independent sales representatives and distributors located in all regions of the United States, Canada, the European Union (EU), Southeast Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East.
 
The customers we service are in the Military, Aerospace, Space, Medical, Oil and Gas, Industrial, Test Equipment and Commercial Electronics markets. We appear on the Military Qualified Product Listing “QPL” to MIL-DTL-55302 and supply customer requested modifications to this specification. Sales to the Commercial electronics (inclusive of commercial aerospace, space, oil & gas, medical and miscellaneous markets) and Military markets were 49.9% and 50.1%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales for the year ended March 29, 2019. Our offering of “QPL” items has recently been expanded to include additional products.
 
In order to remain competitive, the Company has an internal program to upgrade, add and maintain machinery, review material costs and increase labor force productivity. During the fiscal years ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, the Company purchased several machines to increase the productivity of certain processes. This will help us meet this goal.
 
New Product Development
 
The Company is sought after by many of its customers to design and manufacture custom connectors. This has created many new products that are innovative designs and employ new technologies. The Company continues to be successful because of its ability to assist its customers and create new designs, including engineering drawing packages, in a relatively short period of time. We will continue to support our customers to the best of our ability.
 
A recent product line featuring high-speed and hybrid power signal connectors has been added to the Company’s product offering. The Company expects to recognize meaningful revenue from these product lines and we expect it to contribute substantially to the bottom line in the coming years.
 
The standard printed circuit board connectors we produce are continually being expanded and utilized in many of the military programs being built today. We have recently received approval for additional products that we can offer under the Military Qualified Product Listing “QPL.”

Commitments
 
The Company has a collective bargaining multi-employer pension plan (“Multi-Employer Plan”) with the United Auto Workers of America, Local 259 (the “Union”). Contributions are made in accordance with a negotiated labor contract and are based on the number of covered employees employed per month. With the passage of the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1990 (the “1990 Act”), the Company may become subject to liabilities in excess of contributions made under the collective bargaining agreement. Generally, these liabilities are contingent upon the termination, withdrawal, or partial withdrawal from the Multi-Employer Plan. The Company has not taken any action to terminate, withdraw or partially withdraw from the Multi-Employer Plan nor does it intend to do so in the future. Under the 1990 Act, liabilities would be based upon the Company’s proportional share of the Multi-Employer Plan’s unfunded vested benefits, Based upon such Plan’s information and data as of December 31, 2018 furnished to the Company (including, without limitation, unfunded vested benefits, accumulated benefits and net assets), such Plan is fully funded. Based thereupon, the Company’s proportional share of the liability through December 31, 2018 is fully funded. The total contributions charged to operations under such Plan were $65,075 for the year ended March 29, 2019 and $151,314 for the year ended March 30, 2018.
Marketing and Sales
 
The market for connectors and interconnect devices, domestic and worldwide, is highly fragmented as a result of the manufacture by many companies of a multitude of different types and varieties of connectors and interconnects. For example, connectors include: printed wiring board, rectangular I/O, circular, planar (IOC) RF coaxial, IC socket and fiber optic. The Company has been servicing a niche in the market by manufacturing connectors containing HYPERBOLOID contact designs in the printed wiring board style of connectors.
 
The Company is continuously experimenting with innovative connection designs, which may cause it to alter its marketing plans in the future if a market should develop for any of its current or future innovative designs. The Company is continually reviewing product lines being sold in the connector and interconnect marketplace. We are committed to expanding our product offering and we consider that many of our current or future custom designs will become product lines.
 
The Company’s products are marketed to OEM’s (Original Equipment Manufacturers) directly and through authorized representatives and distributors serving primarily the Military, Aerospace, Medical, Space, Industrial, Test Equipment and Commercial Electronics markets. The Company is also involved in developing new connectors for specific uses, which result from changes in technology. The Company assists customers in the development and design of connectors for specific customer applications. This service is marketed to customers who require the development of connectors and interconnection devices specially designed to accommodate the customers’ own products.
 
The Company is primarily a manufacturer and its products are essentially basic components of larger assemblies of finished goods. Approximately 90% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, respectively, were made directly to manufacturers of finished products with the balance of the Company’s products sold to distributors. Distributors often purchase connectors for customers who do not require large quantities of connectors over a short period of time but rather require small allotments of connectors over an extended period of time.
 
During the fiscal year ended March 29, 2019, two customers accounted for $7,451,032 constituting 26.2% of the Company’s net sales. One of those customers accounted for 13.7% of the Company’s net sales while the second customer accounted for 12.5% of the Company’s net sales.
 
During the fiscal year ended March 30, 2018, one customer accounted for $2,685,250 constituting 11.4% of the Company’s net sales.
 
The Company currently employs 25 independent sales representatives to market its products in all regions in the United States as well as in Canada, the European Union (EU), Southeast Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. These

Marketing and Sales (continued)
 
independent sales representatives also promote the product lines of other electronics manufacturers; however, they do not promote the product lines of manufacturers which compete directly with the Company’s products. These sales representatives accounted for approximately 95% of Company net sales for the year ended March 29, 2019 (with the balance of Company net sales being generated via direct customer contact).
 
International sales accounted for approximately 18.3% of net sales for the year ended March 29, 2019 and 20% of net sales for the year ended March 30, 2018, respectively.
 
Backlog of Orders/Capital Requirements
 
The backlog of orders for the Company’s products amounted to approximately $18,407,000 at March 29, 2019 as compared to $15,658,000 at March 30, 2018. A portion of these orders are subject to cancellation or postponement of delivery dates and, therefore, no assurance can be given that actual sales will result from these orders. The Company does not foresee any problems which would prevent it from fulfilling its orders.
 

Competition
-----------

 
The design, development, manufacture and distribution of electrical connectors and interconnection devices is a highly competitive field. The Company principally competes with companies who produce high performance connectors in printed circuits and wiring boards for high technology application. The Company competes by adapting certain technologies to meet specific product applications, producing connectors cost-effectively, and through its production capabilities. In addition, there are many companies who offer connectors with designs similar to those utilized by the Company and are direct competitors of the Company.
 
The primary basis upon which the Company competes is product performance and production capabilities. The Company usually receives job orders after submitting bids pursuant to customer-issued specifications for connectors and interconnects. The Company’s bid can be for a new item that requires the item to perform under harsh environment requirements or it can be for a standard catalog item. The Company also offers engineering services to its customers in designing and developing connectors for specialized products and specific customer applications. This enables the Company to receive a competitive advantage over those companies who basically manufacture connectors based solely or primarily on cataloged specifications.
 
Many of the Company’s competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and no assurances can be given that the Company will be able to compete effectively with these companies in the future.
 
Suppliers of Raw Materials and Component Parts
 
The Company utilizes a variety of raw materials and manufactured component parts, which it purchases from various suppliers. These materials and components are available from numerous sources and the Company does not believe that it will have a problem obtaining such materials and parts in the future.
 
However, any delay in the Company’s ability to obtain necessary raw materials and component parts may affect its ability to meet customer production needs. In anticipation of such delays, the Company carries an inventory of raw materials and component parts to avoid shortages and to insure continued production.
 
Employees 
 
The Company presently employs approximately 199 people, two (2) of whom are executive officers; six (6) are engaged in management activities; eight (8) provide general and administrative services; and approximately 183 are employed in manufacturing and testing activities. Most of the employees engaged in manufacturing and testing activities are covered by

a collective bargaining agreement with the Union, which will expire on March 31, 2021. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its employees and the Union.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
The Company is subject to federal regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and the Defense Supply Command Columbus (“DSCC”).
 
OSHA provides federal guidelines and specifications to companies in order to insure the health and safety of employees. DSCC oversees the quality and specifications of products and components manufactured and sold to the government and the defense industry. DSCC’s primary customer is the U.S. military. Many of our products appear on the DSCC Qualified Products Listing (“QPL”). To remain qualified, the Company submits its products to an outside testing laboratory which performs all required testing. After review by the Company of the testing results the data is then submitted to the DSCC. The Company and its products are only approved and remain on the QPL if the Company has passed all testing requirements. Although DSCC continuously requires products to an outside testing laboratory which performs all required testing. After review by the Company of the testing results the data is then submitted to the DSCC. The Company and its products are only approved and remain on the QPL if the Company has passed all testing requirements. Although DSCC continuously requires suppliers to meet changing specifications, the Company has not encountered any significant problems meeting such specifications and its products have, in the past, been approved. The Company is unaware of any changes in the Government’s regulations which are expected to materially affect the Company’s business.
