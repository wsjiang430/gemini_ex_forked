Item 1.    Business
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Annual Report which address activities, events or developments, which we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words “believes,” “intends,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “estimates,” “predicts” and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements include, among others, such things as:

• | our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations, access our credit facility, or raise cash in order to meet our short and long-term capital requirements;


• | the impact to our business of changes in crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices;


• | amounts and nature of future revenues and margins from each of our segments;


• | trends in the industries we serve;


• | the likely impact of new or existing regulations or market forces on the demand for our services;


• | expansion and other trends of the industries we serve;


• | our expectations with respect to the likelihood of a future impairment; and


• | our ability to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement.

These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we made in light of our experience and our historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including:

• | the risk factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report and listed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;


• | economic, market or business conditions in general and in the oil, natural gas, power, iron and steel, agricultural and mining industries in particular;


• | the under-utilization of our work force;


• | delays in the commencement of major projects, whether due to permitting issues or other factors;


• | reduced creditworthiness of our customer base and the higher risk of non-payment of receivables due to volatility of crude oil, natural gas, steel and other commodity prices to which our customers' businesses are affected;


• | the inherently uncertain outcome of current and future litigation;


• | the adequacy of our reserves for claims and contingencies;


• | changes in laws or regulations, including the imposition, cancellation or delay of tariffs on imported goods; and


• | other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences or effects on our business operations. We assume no obligation to update publicly, except as required by law, any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

OPERATING SEGMENTS
We operate our business through four reportable segments: Electrical Infrastructure; Oil Gas & Chemical; Storage Solutions; and Industrial.
The Electrical Infrastructure segment consists of power delivery services provided to investor owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, short-run transmission line installations, distribution upgrades and maintenance, as well as emergency and storm restoration services. We also provide construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, such as combined cycle plants and other natural gas fired power stations.
The Oil Gas & Chemical segment serves customers primarily in the downstream and midstream petroleum industries who are engaged in refining crude oil and processing, fractionating, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. We also perform work in the petrochemical, upstream petroleum, and sulfur extraction, recovery and processing markets. Our services include plant maintenance, turnarounds, engineering and capital construction. We also offer industrial cleaning services, including hydro-blasting, hydro-excavating, advanced chemical cleaning and vacuum services.
The Storage Solutions segment consists of work related to aboveground storage tanks ("AST") and terminals. Also included in this segment are cryogenic and other specialty storage tanks and terminals including liquefied natural gas, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen, liquid petroleum and other specialty vessels such as spheres as well as marine structures and truck and rail loading/offloading facilities. Our services include engineering, fabrication and construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services for both tanks and full terminals. Finally, we offer AST products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.

Our services include engineering, fabrication and construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services. We also design instrumentation and control systems and offer specialized expertise in the design and construction of bulk material handling systems.
OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS
Customers and Marketing
The Company provided services to approximately 500 customers in fiscal 2019. Most of our revenue comes from long-term customer relationships. None of our customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2019. However, within our operating segments we do have customer concentrations of varying degrees. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data, Note 13 - Segment Information for more information about concentration of revenues by segment.
Matrix markets its services and products primarily through its marketing and business development personnel, senior professional staff and its operating management. We competitively bid most of our projects; however, we have a number of preferred provider relationships with customers who award us work through long-term agreements. Our projects have durations ranging from a few days to multiple years.
Competition
We compete with local, regional, national and international contractors and service providers. Competitors vary with the markets we serve with few competitors competing in all of the markets we serve or in all of the services we provide. Contracts are generally awarded based on price, quality, safety performance, schedule, experience and customer satisfaction. 
Backlog
We define backlog as the total dollar amount of revenue that we expect to recognize as a result of performing work that has been awarded to us through a signed contract, limited notice to proceed or other type of assurance that we consider firm. The following arrangements are considered firm:

• | fixed-price awards;


• | minimum customer commitments on cost plus arrangements; and


• | certain time and material arrangements in which the estimated value is firm or can be estimated with a reasonable amount of certainty in both timing and amounts.

For long-term maintenance contracts with no minimum commitments and other established customer agreements, we include only the amounts that we expect to recognize as revenue over the next 12 months. For arrangements in which we have received a limited notice to proceed, we include the entire scope of work in our backlog if we conclude that the likelihood of the full project proceeding as high. For all other arrangements, we calculate backlog as the estimated contract amount less revenues recognized as of the reporting date.
The following table provides a summary of changes in our backlog in fiscal 2019:

 | ElectricalInfrastructure | | Oil Gas &Chemical | | StorageSolutions | | Industrial | | Total

Project awards in all segments are cyclical and are typically the result of a sales process that can take several months to complete. Backlog volatility may increase for some segments from time to time when individual project awards are less frequent, but more significant. We expect to recognize approximately 85% of our total backlog reported as of June 30, 2019 as revenue within the next year.
Seasonality and Other Factors
Our operating results can exhibit seasonal fluctuations, especially in our Oil Gas & Chemical segment, for a variety of reasons. Turnarounds and planned outages at customer facilities are typically scheduled in the spring and the fall when the demand for energy is lower. Within the Electrical Infrastructure segment, transmission and distribution work is generally scheduled by the public utilities when the demand for electricity is at its lowest. Therefore, revenue volume in the summer months is typically lower than in other periods throughout the year.
Our business can also be affected, both positively and negatively, by seasonal factors such as energy demand or weather conditions including hurricanes, snowstorms, and abnormally low or high temperatures. Some of these seasonal factors may cause some of our offices and projects to close or reduce activities temporarily. In addition to the above noted factors, the general timing of project starts and completions could exhibit significant fluctuations. Accordingly, results for any interim period may not necessarily be indicative of operating results for the full year.
Other factors impacting operating results in all segments come from decreased work volumes during holidays, work site permitting delays or customers accelerating or postponing work. The differing types, sizes, and durations of our contracts, combined with their geographic diversity and stages of completion, often results in fluctuations in the Company's operating results.
Material Sources and Availability
Steel plate and steel pipe are key materials used by the Company. Supplies of these materials are available throughout the United States and globally from numerous sources. We anticipate that adequate amounts of these materials will be available in the foreseeable future. However, the price, quantity, and the delivery schedules of these materials could change rapidly due to various factors, including producer capacity, the level of imports, worldwide demand, tariffs on imported goods and other market conditions.
Insurance
The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its operations. However, exposure to potential losses is retained through the use of deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverage limits.
Typically our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide warranties for materials. The Company may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies or surety bonds for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects. Matrix maintains a performance and payment bonding line sufficient to support the business. The Company generally requires its subcontractors to indemnify the Company and the Company’s customer and name the Company as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of the Company, to secure the subcontractors’ work. There can be no assurance that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers.
Employees
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had approximately 5,000 employees of which approximately 1,050 were employed in non-field positions and 3,950 were employed in field or shop positions. The number of employees varies significantly throughout the year because of the number, type and size of projects we have in progress at any particular time.
The Company’s subsidiaries include both merit and union companies. The union businesses operate under collective bargaining agreements with various unions representing different groups of our employees. Union agreements provide union employees with benefits including health and welfare, pension, training programs and competitive compensation plans. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in recent years. We maintain health and welfare, retirement and training programs for our merit employees and administrative personnel.

Patents and Proprietary Technology
Matrix Service Company’s subsidiaries have several patents and patents pending, and continue to pursue new ideas and innovations to better serve our customers in several areas of our business. The Flex-A-Span® and Flex-A-Seal® trademarks are utilized to market the Company’s unique seals for floating roof tanks. The FastFroth® trademark is utilized to market the Company’s unique industrial cleaning process. Our patented RS 1000 Tank Mixer controls sludge build-up in crude oil tanks through resuspension. The Flexible Fluid Containment System patent covers a system that captures and contains flue leaking from pipe and valve connections. The Flex-A-Swivel patent refers to our unique pipe swivel joint assembly. Our patent for Spacerless or Geocomposite Double Bottom for Storage Tanks relates to a replacement bottom with leak detection and containment that allows for the retrofitting of an existing tank while minimizing the loss of capacity. The patent for the Training Tank for Personnel Entry, Exit and Rescue relates to a training device that can be used to train personnel on equipment that is made to simulate confined space scenarios.
The Company also holds a perpetual license to use various patents and technologies related to LNG storage tanks, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen storage tanks, liquid petroleum gas storage tanks and thermal vacuum chambers. 
While the Company’s intellectual property is not its main business, we believe that the ability to use these patents and technology enables us to expand our presence in the markets we serve and minimizes the development costs typically associated with organic growth.
Regulation
Health and Safety Regulations
Our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), the U.S. Department of Transportation, and to regulation under state laws and by the Canadian Workers’ Compensation Board and its Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted strict and comprehensive safety regulations. The Company has established and consistently reinforces and monitors compliance with comprehensive programs intended to ensure that it complies with all applicable health and safety regulations to protect the safety of its workers, subcontractors and customers. While the Company believes that it operates safely and prudently, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that the Company will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of its businesses. In order to minimize the financial exposure resulting from potential accidents associated with the Company's work, the Company maintains liability insurance to limit losses that could result from our work.
Environmental
The Company’s operations and the operations of its customers are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. The Company is exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or hazardous materials.
In order to limit costs incurred as a result of environmental exposure, the Company maintains contractor’s pollution liability insurance that covers liability that may be incurred as a result of accidental releases of hazardous materials.
The Company believes that it is currently in compliance, in all material aspects, with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company does not expect any material charges in subsequent periods relating to environmental conditions that currently exist and does not currently foresee any significant future capital spending relating to environmental matters.
