Recent Events
The continued presence of COVID-19 has and will likely continue to create uncertainties and disruptions to the Company as well as the global economy. This has resulted in operational and financial challenges and risks. In response, we implemented extensive additional health and safety protocols from time to time in keeping with governmental requirements and best practices. As a result of the continued evolving presence of variants of the virus, and related global impacts, there are likely to be ongoing disruptions to certain supply chains as well as impacts on customer demand that may present additional challenges and volatility to our business.
During 2022, inflation negatively impacted our input costs and pricing, primarily for labor and materials. We, our customers, and our suppliers also began to experience the effect of a higher interest rate environment. Gross domestic product growth slowed throughout 2022 largely due to the widespread impacts of inflation, increasing interest rates, and more restrictive financial conditions. Supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and global inflation remain persistent, along with elevated geopolitical instability.
Specifically, the current conflict in Ukraine has created geopolitical unrest resulting in economic uncertainty and 

4



volatility with regard to energy prices, interest rates and our supply chain. We are monitoring the developments as they unfold in order to react accordingly. The impact of the conflict on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted. The Company does not believe the impact on our results to be material at this time.


The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA is federal legislation designed to raise revenue from lowering of prescription drug prices and imposition of certain corporate tax measures, while authorizing spending on energy and climate change initiatives, subsidizing the Affordable Care Act, and enacting certain tax reforms. Management continues to monitor any potential impact of the IRA on our results. No immediate or direct effect from the legislation is anticipated to have a material impact on our results at this time.
The CHIPS and Science Act (“CHIPS”) was signed into law in August 2022. CHIPS is a federal statue providing funding for research and domestic production of semiconductors. Additional funding can be provided through CHIPS to various federal agencies as well as towards climate science research. No immediate or direct material effect from the legislation is anticipated to have a material impact on our results at this time.
Beginning in the last half of 2021, certain regions of China experienced energy shortages which have, for brief periods of time, impacted our facilities. The impact was not material to our results during 2021 and 2022, however, there continue to be uncertainties related to the energy shortages that may impact us in 2023 and beyond. We have been able to proactively mitigate the impact of the restrictions on energy usage to date by managing our scheduling at the impacted facilities.

OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS
Sales and Marketing
We design and develop our products within our Technology Centers and can manufacture these products and solutions in various facilities located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also operate Allied Motion Solution Centers that evaluate and focus all Allied Motion products to create integrated controlled motion solutions for our customers. We sell our products and solutions globally to a broad spectrum of customers through our own direct sales force and authorized manufacturers’ representatives and distributors. Our customers include end users and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).
Allied Motion Sales Organization:
The Company’s sales organization is focused on becoming the best sales and service force in its industry. Through the One Team approach for providing products and controlled motion solutions that best address customers’ needs, the Company has broadened the knowledge and skills of its direct sales force, while creating sales and service support in its Solution Centers. This enables the entire sales organization to be capable of selling all products designed, developed and produced by Allied Motion globally. The Company’s primary channels to market include the direct sales force and external authorized Sales Representatives, Agents and Distributors that provide field coverage in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Canada, Israel and the Americas. While most of the Company’s sales are directly to OEMs, it has expanded its market reach through Distribution channels.
Allied Motion Solution Centers: 
Allied Motion has Solution Centers in China, Europe and North America that enable the design and sale of individual component products as well as integrated controlled motion systems that utilize multiple Allied Motion products and technologies. In addition to providing sales and applications support, the solution center function may include final assembly, integration and tests as required to support customers within their geographic region.
Sales Backlog:
Backlog as of December 31, 2022 was $330,078 compared with $249,927 as of December 31, 2021. Included in backlog as of December 31, 2022 is $21,222 from the acquisitions completed in 2022. The time to convert the majority of backlog to sales is approximately three to nine months. Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales. We may on occasion receive multi-year orders from customers for product to be delivered on demand over that time frame. There is no assurance that the Company’s backlog from these customers will be converted into revenue.
Major Customer
Sales to one customer were 11% of total sales in 2022 and 15% of total sales in 2021. We believe the diversification of the target markets and customers we serve reduces our exposure to negative developments with any single customer.
Competitive Environment
Our products and solutions are sold into the global market with a large and diverse group of competitors that vary by product, geography, industry and application. The controlled motion market is highly fragmented with many competitors, some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than Allied Motion. We believe our competitive advantages include our electro-magnetic, mechanical and electronic controlled motion expertise, the breadth 

7



of our motor technologies and our ability to integrate these technologies with our encoders, gearing, power electronics, digital control technologies and network/feedback communications capabilities, as well as our global presence. Unlike many of our competitors, we are unique in our ability to provide custom-engineered controlled motion solutions that integrate the products we manufacture such as embedded or external electrical control solutions with our motors. We compete on technological capabilities, quality, reliability, service responsiveness, delivery speed and price. Our competitors include Altra Industrial Motion, Ametek, Inc., Parker Hannifin Corporation and other smaller competitors.
Availability and Prices of Parts and Raw Materials
We purchase critical raw materials from a limited number of suppliers due to the technically challenging requirements of the supplied product and/or the lengthy process required to qualify these materials both internally and with our customers. We cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials in some cases because of these rigid requirements. For these critical raw materials, we maintain minimum safety stock levels and partner with suppliers through contract to help ensure the continuity of supply. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic and supply chain disruptions, we have experienced upward pricing pressure and challenges with availability of parts and raw materials. In addition, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at our customers and suppliers has led to increases in prices and freight costs. As we seek to secure supply during volatile times, we have proactively increased the levels of certain inventories to put us in the position to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
We hold several patents and trademarks for components manufactured by our various subsidiaries, and we have several patents pending on new products recently developed, which we believe are significant.
Working Capital Items
We currently maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of production while taking into account the potential for supply chain disruptions. We consider the component parts of our different product lines to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs under normal conditions. As discussed herein, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions, we have experienced increased costs and have purposely increased certain inventories to manage global supply chain issues.
Engineering and Development Activities
Our engineering and development (E&D) activities are for the development of new products, enhancement of the functionality, effectiveness and reliability of current products, to redesign products to reduce the cost of manufacturing of products or to expand the types of applications for which our products and solutions can be used. Our engineering and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $38,561 and $27,818, respectively, or 8% and 7% of sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe E&D is critical to our ongoing success and expect to continue to invest at similar levels in the future. Of these expenditures, no material amounts were charged directly to customers, although we record non-recurring engineering charges to certain customers for custom engineering required to develop products that meet the customer’s specifications.
Environmental Issues
The Company takes its responsibility to be a good steward of the environment seriously and we adopt policies and procedures under the guidance of the Board of Directors that advance our performance. No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by Federal, State or local provisions concerning environmental controls.
We monitor existing and pending climate legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords to evaluate any potential impact on our future results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. The Board of Directors provides oversight as part of their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives and we will continue to monitor emerging developments and assess our performance in this area. We may face additional economic and 

8



operational impacts from ESG regulations as well as impacts from our suppliers and customers as they adhere to the laws and regulations.
International Operations
Our operations outside the United States are conducted through wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and are located in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Our international operations are subject to the usual risks inherent in international trade, including currency fluctuations, local government contracting regulations, local governmental restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of profits, exchange controls, regulation of the import and distribution of foreign goods, as well as changing economic and social conditions in countries in which our operations are conducted. The information required by this item is set forth in Note 13, Segment Information, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
Human Capital
Employment
At December 31, 2022, we employed 2,254 full-time employees worldwide. Of those, approximately 57% are located in North America, 33% are located in Europe and the remainder are located in Asia-Pacific. As of December 31, 2022, 18% of our total workforce were employed in engineering functions, demonstrating our commitment to invest significantly in engineering resources.
