Our History and Corporate Structure

China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. (“China Health US”) was incorporated in the State of Arizona on July 11, 1996 and was the successor of the business known as Arizona Mist, Inc. which began in 1989. On May 9, 2005, it entered into a stock purchase agreement and share exchange (effecting a reverse merger) with Edmonds 6, Inc. (“Edmonds 6”), a Delaware corporation, and changed its name to Universal Fog, Inc. Pursuant to this agreement, Universal Fog, Inc. (which has been in continuous operation since 1996) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edmonds 6.
 
China Health Industries Holdings Limited (“China Health HK”) was incorporated on July 20, 2007 in Hong Kong under the Companies Ordinance as a limited liability company. China Health HK was formed for the purpose of seeking and consummating a merger or acquisition with a business entity organized as a private corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship as defined by FASB ACS Topic 915 (“Development Stage Entities”).
 
Harbin Humankind Biology Technology Co., Limited (“Humankind”) was incorporated in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) on December 14, 2003, as a limited liability company under the Company Law of the PRC. Humankind is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of health products.
 
On August 20, 2007, the sole shareholder of China Health HK entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with the owners of Humankind. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, China Health HK purchased 100% of the ownership in Humankind for a cash consideration of $60,408 (the “Share Purchase”). Subsequent to the completion of the Share Purchase, Humankind became a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Health HK. The Share Purchase was accounted for as a “reverse merger” since the owner of Humankind owned a majority of the outstanding shares of China Health HK’s common stock immediately following the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, it was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that have been reflected in the financial statements for periods prior to the Share Purchase are those of Humankind and have been recorded at the historical cost basis. After completion of the Share Purchase, China Health HK’s consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of both China Health HK and Humankind, the historical operations of Humankind, and the operations of China Health HK and its subsidiaries from the closing date of the Share Purchase onward.
 
On October 14, 2008, Humankind set up a 99% owned subsidiary, Harbin Huimeijia Medicine Company (“Huimeijia”), with its primary business being manufacturing and distributing medicine. Mr. Xin Sun, the Company’s majority owner, owns 1% of Huimeijia. Huimeijia is consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of China Health HK.
 
On December 31, 2008, China Health HK entered into a reverse merger with Universal Fog, Inc., a U.S. publicly traded shell company (the “Transaction”). China Health HK is the acquirer in the Transaction, and the Transaction was treated as a recapitalization of China Health US. After the Transaction and a 20:1 reverse stock split, Mr. Xin Sun owned 61,203,088 shares of common stock, representing 98.3% of the 62,234,737 total outstanding shares of common stock of China Health US. On April 7, 2009, Mr. Sun transferred 28,200,000 shares of common stock to 296 individuals, leaving him with 33,003,088 shares of common stock of China Health US, or approximately 53.03% of the total outstanding shares of common stock. Universal Fog, Inc. changed its name to China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. on February 19, 2009.
 
On November 22, 2013, Humankind completed the acquisition of Heilongjiang Huimeijia Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“HLJ Huimeijia”) for a total purchase price of $16,339,869 (RMB100,000,000). HLJ Huimeijia was founded on October 30, 2003, and is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of tincture, ointments, rubber paste (including hormones), topical solution, suppositories, liniment (including traditional Chinese medicine extractions), enemas and oral liquids. HLJ Huimeijia’s predecessor is Heilongjiang Xue Du Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which has established its brand name in the market through its supply of high-quality medical products. HLJ Huimeijia is categorized as a “high and new technology” enterprise by the Science Technology Department in Heilongjiang Province. HLJ Huimeijia has 21 products which have been approved by, and have received approval numbers issued by, the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”). In addition, HLJ Huimeijia is the holder of one patent for utility models, five patents for external design and three trademarks in China, including the Chinese brand name of “Xue Du” which has an established reputation among customers in northeastern China.

On December 24, 2014, Humankind entered into a stock transfer agreement (the “Original Agreement”) with (i) Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. a company incorporated under the laws of the PRC and located in Jilin province (“Xiuzheng Pharmacy” or the “Buyer”), (ii) Mr. Xin Sun, the CEO of the Company, and (iii) Huimeijia, a subsidiary of Humankind that is 99% owned by Humankind and 1% owned by Mr. Xin Sun. Pursuant to the Original Agreement, Humankind and Mr. Xin Sun (collectively, the “Equity Holders”), would sell their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to Xiuzheng Pharmacy.
 
On February 9, 2015, the four parties entered into a supplementary agreement (the “Supplementary Agreement”) to modify the terms of the Original Agreement, pursuant to which the Equity Holders and Huimeijia (collectively, the “Asset Transferors”) would only sell 19 drug approval numbers (the “Assets”) to Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The Equity Holders would have retained their equity interests in Huimeijia, but would have pledged such equity interests to Xiuzheng Pharmacy until the Assets were transferred.
 
On October 12, 2016, the four parties agreed to rescind the Supplementary Agreement and entered into a new supplementary agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to execute the transfer of the equity interests based on the Original Agreement, and the Equity Holders sold their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to Xiuzheng Pharmacy for total cash consideration of RMB 8,000,000 (approximately $1,306,186 USD, the “Purchase Price”) to the Equity Holders. As of October 12, 2016, Huimeijia had completed changes in its business registration, and Xiuzheng Pharmacy had obtained a new business license issued by the local State Administration of Industry and Commerce in Harbin (“Harbin SAIC”) for Huimeijia, in which Huimeijia’s ownership was recorded as held by Xiuzheng Pharmacy, and the legal representative (a person that is authorized to take most corporate actions on behalf of a company under PRC corporate laws) of Huimeijia had been appointed by the Buyer.
 
China Health US, China Health HK, Humankind and HLJ Huimeijia are collectively referred herein to as the “Company.”
 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company’s corporate structure was as follows:

Business Overview

Humankind was incorporated in the PRC on December 14, 2003, and completed its Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) certificate on April 24, 2007, which expired on February 14, 2019. As Humankind is in the business of manufacturing and selling health products, it is considered as a food manufacturer in China. Instead of issuing GMP, the CFDA now issues SC Permit (Food Manufacture Permit) to food manufacturers in China. Humankind received its SC Permit on July 26, 2018, which will expire on September 12, 2021. It has also obtained the business license to sell hemp derivative products and is expanding such sales.
 
HLJ Huimeijia was founded on October 30, 2003, and its latest GMP certificate is effective until April 24, 2023. HLJ Huimeijia engages in the manufacturing and distribution of tincture, ointments, rubber paste (including hormones), topical solution, suppositories, liniment (including traditional Chinese medicine extractions), enemas and oral liquids. Its predecessor is Heilongjiang Xue Du Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which had established brand recognition in the market through its supply of high-quality drug products. HLJ Huimeijia is a “high and new technology” enterprise that provides the most comprehensive types of topical medical products in Heilongjiang Province, a northeastern province of China. GMP is a term that is recognized worldwide for the control and management of manufacturing and quality control testing of foods and pharmaceutical products.
 
Our business is conducted through our PRC subsidiaries, Humankind and HLJ Huimeijia. Our products are primarily sold through sales agents. Although we do not currently sell our products online, we expect to do so in the future.
 
Products

We have, through Humankind, the license to manufacture and sell 14 health products, each of which have been assigned a Guo Shi Jian Zi number, or China health food approval number (as provided below), an approval number issued by the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”). A product with such a number shall include a description of the nourishment value and health function of the products on product specifications. Consumers can check the official website of CFDA to verify a health product through such a number. Besides, we have the capacity to produce 8 hemp derivative products in soft capsule, hard capsule, tablet, granule, oral liquid forms.
 
We have, through HLJ Huimeijia, the license to manufacture and sell 21 products. In addition, HLJ Huimeijia holds one patent for utility models, five patents for external design, and three trademarks in China, including the Chinese characters of “Xue Du,” which has a good reputation amongst customers in northeastern China.
 
We are licensed to sell our products, including our medical drugs, only in the PRC.

Manufacture

We manufacture our health food products on a plot of land located in Jin Xing Industrial Park, Songbei District, Harbin. On June 7, 2004, the Company entered into a Land Use Purchase Contract with the local government, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase the right to use a piece of land, approximately 8 acres (32,000 square meters), located in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province for commercial purposes for a fifty-year period from June 7, 2004 through June 6, 2054, for $637,261 (RMB5,248,000). The Company fully paid to the government the consideration for the land use right on June 13, 2004. The Department of Housing and Urban Development of Harbin City approved this transaction. The Company is in the process of applying for the title certificate from the local government. The manufacturing facility on the land is 4,000 square meters and there are five production lines which are sufficient for our purposes. We package our products in bottles, plastic containers and aluminum foil bags there.
 
Since we acquired HLJ Huimeijia on November 22, 2013, we also manufacture our medicines and drugs using HLJ Huimeijia’s land, approximately 43,350 square meters, located in Hai-lin Economic Development Zone, Mudanjiang City. The manufacturing facilities occupy approximately 5,710 square meters. We plan to build new manufacturing facilities on the land. The expected construction cost is approximately $7,520,000 (RMB 50,000,000).
 
Our Development Strategy
 
We will continue focusing on combining our products with traditional Chinese medicine, the creation of new products such as our hemp-based products, and developing our B2C e-business and chain-stores. We plan to implement health management projects in our future chain-stores throughout China and establish a database of our clients’ health data obtained from our B2C e-business and call center.
 
We plan to establish a one-stop shop for our customer’s health needs. From conducting a genetic profile of our customer to determine his/her susceptibility to certain types of diseases and then customizing health supplements and organic/green food to meet his/her needs, we plan to cater to our customer’s needs at all levels. With the distribution network we hope to establish through our chain stores and B2C e-businesses, we plan to eventually branch out into the sale and distribution of beauty products and medical appliances.
 
We plan to open chain stores of up to 100 stores within the next 24 months; expand our oversea sales to North America, South Asia and European Union; acquire pharmaceuticals to enhance marketing network and production capacity and increase investment in research and development of CBD drugs and hemp-based products.
 
The Future

Within the next ten years, our goals are to:
 

1. | Increase product coverage in target markets; achieve 20%-30% coverage
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our target market is the health industry market. Presently, we believe that our product coverage is approximately 0.2%. We plan to open distribution stores in different provinces of China to expand our coverage. We also plan to sell our products through B2C websites to our customers.
 

2. | Enter into the medicine, health product, health industry top 500 companies in the PRC
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently, we are not ranked in the top 500 medicine, health product and health industry companies in the PRC. We believe that if our projected increase in revenue is achieved, we will achieve our goal of becoming one of the top 500 medicine, health product, health industry companies in China.
 

3. | Form a diversified management group
---+------------------------------------

 
Currently, our management group comprises graduates from the most prestigious universities in the PRC, such as Peking University and Renmin University of China. We plan to further diversify our management group by hiring talent both in the PRC and abroad.
 

4. | Enter into the international market and create an internationally famous brand
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently, our products are sold under the brand names “Qunle”, “Kindlink”, “Huimeijia” and “Dr. Xiao” in the PRC. Our goal is eventually to expand our sales abroad to countries such as the United States of America, Russia, and Eastern Europe and South-east Asian countries.

Good Manufacturing Practice or “GMP” is a term that is recognized worldwide for the control and management of manufacturing and quality control testing of foods and pharmaceutical products. An important part of GMP is documentation of every aspect of the process, activities, and operations involved with drug and medical device manufacture. Additionally, GMP requires that all manufacturing and testing equipment has been qualified as suitable for use, and that all operational methodologies and procedures (such as manufacturing, cleaning, and analytical testing) utilized in the drug manufacturing process have been validated (according to predetermined specifications), to demonstrate that they can perform their purported function(s).
 
The Market for Healthcare and Beauty Products
 
The health product industry is one of the mainstream industries in the PRC, since it has a high level of recognition and importance. Recently there have been new policies for health products, which control quality, manufacturing, manufacturing environments and techniques. With the PRC’s large and aging population there will be a steady demand for healthcare products. It is predicted that the healthcare and beauty industry will flourish over the next 50 years.

The Healthcare Product Market in the PRC

With thousands of years of history in health culture and traditional Chinese medicine, the PRC currently utilizes advanced techniques and production capacity to initiate new health care trends, from drugs and medicines to traditional health food and nutritional supplements, and from medical devices to health management and advice. These trends demonstrate huge potential in the PRC’s health products market.
 
According to a report issued by BCG, the global management consulting firm based in Boston, titled “From Insight to Action: Capturing a Share of China’s Consumer Health Market”, Chinese consumers are increasingly health conscious and China’s growing health and wellness market is expected to reach nearly $70 billion by 2020.
 
With the rise of the concept of “Great Health”, the per capita expenditure of health products and the consumer group have been significantly improved. Roland Berger, a global strategy consulting firm headquartered in Munich, Germany, recently released a report entitled Successful Strategies for China’s Health Products Industry in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan Period. This report analyze the opportunities and challenges of China’s health products market, and puts forward relevant enterprise development strategies. Driven by consumption upgrades and favorable policies, the report predicts that the market scale of health products in China will grow from about RMB120 billion in 2015 to about RMB180 billion in 2020, and will surpass the United States as the world’s largest in the foreseeable future.
 
Driven by the change of consumer treatment to prevention, the promotion of health awareness, the refinement of health needs and the pursuit of high-quality health products, the market scale of health products in China broke through RMB100 billion in 2014 and nearly RMB150 billion in 2017. China Commercial Industry Research Institute predicts that the market scale of health products in China will reach RMB181.6 billion in 2020.
 
Comparing the consumption habits of Chinese and American health products, we can see that there is still much room for development in China’s market. The penetration rate of health products in the United States is 50%, while that in China is only 20%, and in terms of per capita consumption, China is only one-eighth of that in the United States.
 
Hemp and its Market and Industry in the PRC
 
Hemp was originated from the middle and lower reaches of Yellow River with over eight-thousand years’ planting history. The hemp textile technology in our country has matured as early as two thousand years in the Western Han Dynasty. “Plain Color Zen Clothing”, coming up from Han Tombs at Mawangdui and other hemp textile products have become the milestone in the developing history of hemp textile technology.
 
Hemp, also known as Huoma, Xianma, Kuima, Hanma, Dama. Species that containing less than 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is considered as Hemp, and more than 0.3% is considered as Marijuana and Hashish internationally. Hemp is a kind of economic plant with special effects and can be grown in large areas in all parts of China. It has low requirements for soil and climate and can grow on relatively barren land. Planting hemp has become a way to get rich and get out of poverty in some poor areas.
 
Hemp is full of treasures. The skin, stem, seed, root, leaf and flower of hemp have utility value which can be widely applied in the fields of textile, paper-making, food, medicine, construction, transportation, national defense and military industry and so on. As a kind of traditional economic plant, hemp fiber has the functions of moisture absorption and perspiration, natural antimicrobial health care, good quality of adsorption, excellent quality of anti-UV and unique wave adsorption and sound attenuation. The stem of hemp has high degree of lignification and can be used to produce high value biologic additives, viscose fibers, top grade cigarette paper and wooden ceramics and so on. The leaf and flower of hemp can be used to produce various kinds of health products and the seed of hemp can be used to manufacture top grade edible oil, essential oil and hemp protein.

A hemp plant contains over 400 kinds of chemical components and can be divided into cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid compounds. Cannabinol (CBN) in cannabinoid has the functions of anti-inflammatory, analgesia, anti-convulsion and suppressing female hormone secretion. Cannabidiol (CBD) has the functions of anti-inflammatory, sterilization, analgesia, antianxiety, antipsychotic, antioxidation, neural protection, reducing enterocinesia and improving learning and memory ability.
 
Hemp is the major high-yielding crop of making traditional fiber products in China. It is a kind of high value-added economic crop with a wide range of uses and multi-purpose crop with market prospects that provides fiber, hemp stem and seed. Hemp has many unique natural characteristics, especially its environmental benefits and its natural versatility, which is a valuable kind of crop for ecological economy.
 
Textiles, clothing, military industry, construction materials, food, medicines, health supplements, cosmetics and skin care products of the downstream of hemp industry in China are relatively well-developed. The bottleneck that restricts the development of downstream industries is that the cultivation of hemp in the upstream has long been the planting mode of scattered peasant households, and has not formed large-scale industrialized cultivation and local initial processing capacity.
 
After years of development, Chinese consumers have gradually rationalized their attitude and behavior in the consumption of health care products, paying more attention to the safety and efficacy of health care products. At the same time, the government has gradually improved the laws and regulations of the health care industry and tightened its supervision.
 
The rejuvenation of the modern industry of hemp resulted from the major breakthrough in research and mass production of hemp. Firstly, cultivate new varieties of hemp with low activity of anesthetic in agricultural scientific research. The main component of these varieties of anesthetics is THC and the content of THC is controlled at 0.3% which approximates to non-toxicity. This has led to a renewed understanding and affirmation of the industrial use of hemp, and made the cultivation of hemp mechanize, effectively contributing to the development of hemp industry.
 
In order to meet the needs of the development of domestic and foreign market, China has successively reactivated the hemp industry projects in Yunnan, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui and Hubei provinces to set up factories and scientific research institutes to carry out research and development of various products. The natural functional advantages of its related products are favored by consumers at home and abroad. The products are exported to countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Korea. Currently, related products of hemp have also become an export-oriented pillar industry in China.
 
At present, on the basis of solving scientific and technological problems of deep degumming of hemp, extraction of fine fiber, extraction of CBD, purification of hemp seed oil, extraction of essential oil of hemp, extraction of hemp protein, biocomposites, fiber reinforced composite materials, carry out pilot plant test and industrialized mass production of related products of hemp, and gradually develop the deep comprehensive utilization of hemp products, demonstrating the strength of deep processing in the hemp industry.
 
The Hemp Market and Industry in the U. S.
 
An investigation team of the ArcView Group, which is a hemp industry investment and research company headquartered in Oakland, California, found that the sales of legal hemp in the US market increased by 74% in 2014 and reached 2.7 billion dollars (RMB 16.9 billion). and there was only 1.5 billion dollars (about RMB 9.4 billion) in 2013. The report also predicted that it would be a strong development year of legal hemp in 2015 and would increase by 32% in the market. By 2019, all the legal hemp markets will be combined to form a whole market with huge potential which is worth nearly 11 billion dollars.
 
It is predicted in the Forbes Magazine that by 2020, CBD in the US market will be increased by 700%. According to the predicted data provided by the Hemp Business Magazine, the scale of CBD in the US market will reach 2.1 billion dollars by 2020, of which 0.45 billion dollars is from the extraction of hemp-based CBD, the figure was 90 million dollars in 2015. The data provided by the consultant of Lyubo Company is more optimistic, which says that the scale of CBD in the US market will reach 3 billion dollars by 2021.
