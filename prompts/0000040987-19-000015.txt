In the U.S., the Company added two store groups, the Asia Pacific business made one acquisition and the NAPA Canada/UAP business added three store groups. Collectively, the new store groups and acquired automotive operations in the U.S., Australasia and Canada are expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $35 million. 
AAG added 14 acquisitions to their automotive operations in 2018, including three in France and 11 in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). These acquisitions include the addition of several small tuck-in businesses and two larger ones.

Distribution System.    In 2018, the Company operated 57 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution centers located in 40 states and approximately 1,100 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 46 states. The Company also operated domestically two TW Distribution heavy duty parts distribution centers which serve 23 company-owned and four independently owned Traction Heavy Duty parts stores located in eight states. The Traction operations are discussed further below in Related Operations. At December 31, 2018, the Company had either a noncontrolling, controlling or other interest in 8 corporations, which operated approximately 226 auto parts stores in 14 states. The Company’s domestic automotive operations have access to approximately 534,000 different parts and related supply items. These items are purchased from more than 100 different suppliers, with approximately 49% of 2018 automotive parts inventories purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company's domestic operations have had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which have protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.
The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve approximately 4,800 independently owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the U.S. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, sales to these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately 59% of the Company’s total U.S. Automotive sales and 20% of the Company’s total sales.

Products.    The Company’s automotive distribution network provides access to hundreds of thousands of different parts and related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. The majority of orders are filled and shipped the same day they are received. The Company does not manufacture any of the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed in North America under the NAPA® name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA, which is important to the sales and marketing of these products. Traction sales also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck market. In Australasia and Europe, products are distributed under several brand names, including many of the national brands.
Related Operations.    The Company's North American automotive business is supported by several operations that form its Automotive Supply Group. Balkamp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory items for passenger cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions. Balkamp packages many of the 42,000 products, which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that are distributed through the NAPA system. These products are categorized into over 238 different product categories purchased from approximately 500 domestic suppliers and over 100 foreign manufacturers. Balkamp operates from four locations that provide the NAPA system with over 1,300 SKUs of oils and chemicals. BALKAMP®, a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization.
The Company's Rayloc division operates four facilities focused on providing cost effective, quality service in engineering, cataloging, global sourcing, and distribution. With over 10,000 part numbers, including brake pads, brake drums, chassis, and bearings, Rayloc delivers products through a nationwide distribution network of four transfer and shipping facilities. Products are distributed through the NAPA system under the NAPA® brand name. Rayloc® is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.
Finally, the Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW Distribution, with two heavy vehicle automotive parts distribution centers and 27 Traction Heavy Duty parts stores in the U.S. This group distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and direct to small and large fleet owners and operators.
Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores.    The Company believes that the quality and the range of services provided to its North American automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery, parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which, as initiated by the Company from time to time, allows independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs. 
The Company has developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances, including predictive analytics, and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 25 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.
NAPA.    The Company is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, LLC a voluntary association formed in 1925 to promote the distribution of automotive parts for its members. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose sole member in 2018 owned and operated 57 distribution centers located throughout the U.S. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members which, at December 31, 2018, includes only the Company. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.
Among the automotive products purchased by the Company from various manufacturers for distribution are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. Generally, the Company is not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and it may, and does, purchase competitive lines from the same as well as other supply sources.
The Company uses the federally registered trademark NAPA® as part of the trade name of its distribution centers and parts stores. The Company funds NAPA’s national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.
The Company is a party, together with the former members of NAPA, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among the Company and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to

any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.
Competition.    The automotive parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Company competes with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers (including national retail chains), and with other parts distributors and retailers, including online retailers. The Automotive Parts Group competes primarily on product offering, service, brand recognition and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.”
INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP
The Industrial Parts Group is operated as Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion distributes industrial replacement parts and related supplies such as bearings, mechanical and electrical power transmission products, industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and pneumatic components, industrial and safety supplies and material handling products to MRO (maintenance, repair and operation) and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Effective January 1, 2018, EIS, Inc. (“EIS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, became the Electrical Specialties Group of Motion and is therefore included in the Industrial Parts Group. 
In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion Canada”). The Mexican market is served by Motion Mexico S de RL de CV (“Motion Mexico”).
In 2018, the Industrial Parts Group served approximately 200,000 customers in all types of industries located throughout North America, including the equipment and machinery, food and beverage, forest products, primary metals, pulp and paper, mining, automotive, oil and gas, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries; as well as strategically targeted specialty industries such as power generation, alternative energy, government, transportation, ports, and others. Motion services all manufacturing and processing industries with access to a database of 7.6 million parts. Additionally, Motion provides U.S. government agencies access to approximately 365,000 products and replacement parts through a Government Services Administration (GSA) schedule. The Industrial Parts Group, through its Electrical Specialties Group, also distributes materials to more than 20,000 electrical and electronic manufacturers, as well as to industrial assembly and specialty wire and cable markets in North America. This division distributes over 110,000 items including wire, cable and connectivity solutions, insulating and conductive materials, assembly tools and test equipment. 
In 2018, the Company expanded its industrial operations with two tuck-in acquisitions as well as the purchase of Hydraulic Supply Company ("HSC"). HSC, based in Sunrise, Florida, is a leading full-service fluid power distributor with a broad product offering of hydraulic, pneumatic and industrial components and systems. HSC operates one distribution center and 30 branches primarily in the southeastern U.S. In total, the Company's three industrial acquisitions in 2018 are expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $100 million. 
The Company also continues to maintain its 35% investment in Inenco Group ("Inenco"). Inenco, headquartered in Sydney, Australia, is a leading distributor of industrial replacement parts and accessories in Australasia, with current annual revenues of approximately $400 million and a network of 174 locations across Australia, New Zealand and Asia. In accordance with the purchase agreement signed in 2017, the Company has an option to acquire the remaining 65% interest in Inenco at a later date, contingent upon Inenco meeting certain financial conditions. In 2018, the Company accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting.
The Industrial Parts Group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies achieved through the Company’s On-Site Solutions offering. This service provides inventory management, asset repair and tracking, vendor managed inventory commonly referred to as VMI, as well as radio frequency identification, or RFID, asset management of the customer’s inventory. Motion’s Energy Services Team routinely performs in-plant surveys and assessments, helping customers reduce their energy consumption and finding opportunities for improved sustainability, ultimately helping customers operate more profitably. Motion also provides a wide range of services and repairs such as: gearbox and fluid power assembly repair, process pump assembly and repair, hydraulic drive shaft repair, electrical panel assembly and repair, hose and gasket manufacture and assembly, as well as many other value-added services. A highly developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading e-business capabilities, such as MiSupplierConnect, which provides integration between the Company’s information technology network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits for both the supplier and customer. These services and supply chain efficiencies assist Motion in providing the cost savings that many of its customers require and expect.
Distribution System.    In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operated 559 branches, 15 distribution centers, 42 service centers and four fabrication facilities as of December 31, 2018. The distribution centers stock and distribute more than 140,000 different items purchased from more than 950 different suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. The fabrication facilities operated as part of the Electrical Specialities Group and provide custom fabricated 
5

part and specialty coated materials to customers. Approximately 35% of total industrial product purchases in 2018 were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the Industrial Parts Group’s facilities located in 49 states, Puerto Rico, nine provinces in Canada, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. 
Most branches have warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market areas served.
Products.    The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its customers, which are primarily industrial concerns. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, industrial supplies, magnet wire, conductive materials, electrical wire and cable, cable assemblies, insulating and shielding materials, assembly tools, test equipment, adhesives and chemicals, pressure sensitive tapes, solder, anti-static products, thermal management products and coated films. In recent years, Motion expanded its offering to include systems and automation products in response to the increasing sophistication of motion control and process automation for full systems integration of plant equipment. Partnering with its strategic suppliers, Motion has expanded into energy-efficient product markets, focusing on product offerings such as energy-efficient motors and drives and recyclable and environmentally friendly parts and supplies. The nature of Motion's business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with many of its national account customers which, collectively, represent approximately 50% of the annual sales volume.
Supply Agreements.    Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. The Industrial Parts Group has certain return privileges with its suppliers, which helps protect the Company from inventory obsolescence. The Electrical Specialties Group maintains integrated supply programs as part of the marketing strategy to provide its customers, and in particular its national account customers, the opportunity to participate in this low-cost, high-service capability. This group has developed Advanced Inventory Management Solutions ("AIMS"), a totally integrated, highly automated suite of solutions for inventory management. Finally, its integrated supply offering also includes AIMS Dispense, an electronic vending dispenser used to eliminate costly tool cribs and in-house stores at customer warehouse facilities.
Competition.    The industrial parts distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer. The Industrial Parts Group competes primarily on the breadth of product offerings, service and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business.”
