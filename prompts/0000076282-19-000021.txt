The Company consists of the following segments:
Supply Technologies
Our Supply Technologies business provides our customers with Total Supply Management™, a proactive solutions approach that manages the efficiencies of every aspect of supplying production parts and materials to our customers’ manufacturing floor, from strategic planning to program implementation. Total Supply Management™ includes engineering and design support, part usage and cost analysis, supplier selection, quality assurance, bar coding, product packaging and tracking, just-in-time and point-of-use delivery, electronic billing services and ongoing technical support. We operate more than 60 logistics service centers in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Czech Republic, Puerto Rico, Scotland, Hungary, China, Taiwan, Singapore, India, England, France, Spain, Poland, Malaysia, Northern Ireland and Ireland, as well as production sourcing and support centers in the United States and Asia. Through our supply chain management programs, we supply more than 245,000 globally-sourced production components, many of which are specialized and customized to meet individual customers’ needs.
Total Supply Management™ provides our customers with an expert partner in strategic planning, global sourcing, technical services, parts and materials, logistics, distribution and inventory management of production components. Some production components are characterized by low per unit supplier prices relative to the indirect costs of supplier management, quality assurance, inventory management and delivery to the production line. In addition, Supply Technologies delivers an increasingly broad range of higher-value production components including valves, fuel hose assemblies, electro-mechanical hardware, labels, fittings, steering components and many others. Applications engineering specialists and the direct sales force work closely with the engineering staff of OEM customers to recommend the appropriate production components for a new product or to suggest alternative components that reduce overall production costs, streamline assembly or enhance the appearance or performance of the end product. Supply Technologies also provides spare parts and aftermarket products to end users of its customers’ products.
Total Supply Management™ is typically provided to customers pursuant to sole-source arrangements. We believe our approach distinguishes us from traditional buy/sell distributors, as well as manufacturers who supply products directly to customers, because we provide the supply chain management of our customers’ high-volume production components. We administer the processes customized to each customer’s needs by replacing numerous current suppliers with a sole-source relationship with Supply Technologies. Our highly-developed, customized information systems provide global transparency and flexibility through the complete supply chain. This enables our customers to: (1) significantly reduce the direct and indirect cost of production component processes by outsourcing internal purchasing, quality assurance and inventory fulfillment responsibilities; (2) reduce the amount of working capital invested in inventory and floor space; (3) reduce component costs through purchasing efficiencies, including bulk buying and supplier consolidation; and (4) receive technical expertise in production component selection, design and engineering. Our sole-source arrangements foster long-term, entrenched supply relationships with our customers and, as a result, the average tenure of service for our top 50 Supply Technologies clients exceeds ten years. Supply Technologies also supplies wholesale industrial products to other manufacturers and distributors pursuant to master or authorized distributor relationships.
The Supply Technologies segment also engineers and manufactures precision cold-formed and cold-extruded fasteners and other products, including locknuts, SPAC® nuts, SPAC® bolts and wheel hardware, which are principally used in applications where controlled tightening is required due to high vibration. Supply Technologies produces both standard items and specialty products to customer specifications, which are used in large volumes by customers in the automotive, heavy-duty truck and rail industries.
In 2018, the Company made two acquisitions in this segment totaling a cash purchase price of $3.5 million. Both acquired companies distribute products into the aerospace and defense end markets.
Markets and Customers.    For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 66% of Supply Technologies’ net sales were to domestic customers. Remaining sales were primarily to manufacturing facilities of large, multinational customers located in Europe, Mexico, Asia and Canada. Total Supply Management™ is used extensively in a variety of industries, and demand is generally related to the state of the economy and to the overall level of manufacturing activity.
Supply Technologies markets and sells its approach to over 8,700 customers domestically and internationally. The five largest customers, to which Supply Technologies sells through sole-source contracts to multiple operating divisions or 
3

locations, accounted for approximately 30% of the sales of Supply Technologies in 2018 and 2017. The loss of any two or more of its top five customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of this segment.
Competition.    A limited number of companies compete with Supply Technologies to provide supply management services for production parts and materials. Supply Technologies competes primarily on the basis of its Total Supply Management™ approach, including engineering and design support, part usage and cost analysis, supplier selection, quality assurance, bar coding, product packaging and tracking, just-in-time and point-of-use delivery, electronic billing services and ongoing technical support, and its geographic reach, extensive product selection, price and reputation for high service levels. Numerous U.S. and foreign companies compete with Supply Technologies in manufacturing cold-formed and cold-extruded products.
Assembly Components
Assembly Components manufactures products oriented towards fuel efficiency and reduced emission standards. Assembly Components designs, develops and manufactures: aluminum products; highly efficient, high pressure direct fuel injection fuel rails and pipes; fuel filler pipes that route fuel from the gas cap to the gas tank; and flexible multi-layer plastic and rubber assemblies used to transport fuel from the vehicle's gas tank and then, at extreme high pressure, to the engine's fuel injector nozzles. These advanced products, coupled with Turbo Enabled engines, make up large and growing engine architecture for all worldwide car manufacturers. Assembly Components also designs and manufactures Turbo Charging hoses along with Turbo Coolant hoses that will be required as engines get downsized to 3 or 4 cylinders from 6 or 8 cylinders. This engine downsizing increases efficiency, while dramatically decreasing pollution levels. In addition, our Assembly Components segment operates what we believe is one of the few aluminum component suppliers that have the capability to provide a wide range of high-volume, high-quality products utilizing a broad range of processes including gravity and low pressure permanent mold, die-cast and lost-foam, as well as emerging alternative casting technologies. We also provide machining to our aluminum products customers. 
In October 2018, the Company acquired Hydrapower Dynamics Limited (“Hydrapower”) for $7.8 million in cash. Headquartered in Birmingham, England, Hydrapower is a manufacturer of fluid handling systems incorporating hoses, manipulated tubes and fabricated assemblies for the bus and truck, automotive, agricultural and construction end markets. Hydrapower is included in our Assembly Components segment results from the date of acquisition.
Assembly Components operates more than 25 manufacturing facilities and two technical offices in the United States, Mexico, China, England and the Czech Republic. In addition, we also provide value-added services such as design engineering, machining and parts assembly.
Markets and Customers.    For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 71% of Assembly Components’ net sales were to domestic customers. The five largest customers of Assembly Components accounted for approximately 51% of segment sales for 2018 and 2017. These sales, across multiple operating divisions, are through sole-source contracts. The loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of this segment.
Competition.    Assembly Components competes principally on the basis of its ability to: (1) engineer and manufacture high-quality, cost-effective assemblies utilizing multiple technologies in large volumes; (2) provide timely delivery; and (3) retain the manufacturing flexibility necessary to quickly adjust to the needs of its customers. There are few domestic companies with the capabilities to meet customers’ stringent quality and service standards and lean manufacturing techniques. As one of these suppliers, Assembly Components is well-positioned to benefit as customers continue to consolidate their supplier base.

Engineered Products
Our Engineered Products segment operates a diverse group of niche manufacturing businesses that design and manufacture a broad range of highly-engineered products, including induction heating and melting systems, pipe threading systems and forged and machined products. We manufacture these products in more than 10 domestic facilities throughout the United States and more than 20 international facilities in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, China, Italy, India, Japan, Spain and Brazil.
Our induction heating and melting business utilizes proprietary technology and specializes in the engineering, construction, service and repair of induction heating and melting systems, primarily for the ferrous and non-ferrous metals, silicon, coatings, forging, foundry, automotive and construction equipment industries. Our induction heating and melting systems are engineered and built to customer specifications and are used primarily for melting, heating, and surface hardening of metals and curing of coatings. Approximately 43% of our induction heating and melting systems’ revenues are derived from the sale of replacement parts and provision of field service, primarily for the installed base of our own products. Our pipe threading business serves the oil and gas industry. We also engineer and install mechanical forging presses, sell spare parts and provide field service for the large existing base of mechanical forging presses and hammers in North America. We machine, induction harden and surface finish crankshafts and camshafts, used primarily in locomotives. We forge aerospace and defense structural components such as landing gears and struts, as well as rail products such as railcar center plates and draft lugs.
In February 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Canton Drop Forge, Inc. (“CDF”) for $35.6 million in cash. CDF manufactures forgings for high-performance applications in the global aerospace, oil and gas, and other markets. CDF is included in our Engineered Products segment results from the date of acquisition.
Markets and Customers.    For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 57% of Engineered Products’ net sales were to domestic customers. We sell induction heating and other capital equipment to component manufacturers and OEMs in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals, silicon, coatings, forging, foundry, automotive, truck, construction equipment and oil and gas industries. We sell forged and machined products to locomotive manufacturers, machining companies and sub-assemblers who finish aerospace and defense products for OEMs, and railcar builders and maintenance providers.
Competition.    We compete with small-to medium-sized domestic and international equipment manufacturers on the basis of service capability, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery performance and engineering expertise. We compete domestically and internationally with small-to medium-sized forging and machining businesses on the basis of product quality and precision.
Sales and Marketing
Supply Technologies markets its products and services in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia primarily through its direct sales force, which is assisted by applications engineers who provide the technical expertise necessary to assist the engineering staff of OEM customers in designing new products and improving existing products. Assembly Components primarily markets and sells its products in North America through internal sales personnel and independent sales representatives. Engineered Products primarily markets and sells its products in North America through both internal sales personnel and independent sales representatives. Induction heating and pipe threading equipment is also marketed and sold in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa through both internal sales personnel and independent sales representatives. In some instances, the internal engineering staff assists in the sales and marketing effort through joint design and applications-engineering efforts with major customers.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Supply Technologies purchases substantially all of its production components from third-party suppliers. Supply Technologies has multiple sources of supply for its components. An increasing portion of Supply Technologies’ production components are purchased from suppliers in foreign countries, primarily Canada, Taiwan, China, South Korea, Singapore, India and multiple European countries. Supply Technologies is dependent upon the ability of such suppliers to meet stringent quality and performance standards and to conform to delivery schedules. Assembly Components and Engineered Products purchase substantially all of their raw materials, principally metals and certain component parts incorporated into their products, from third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Most raw materials required by Assembly Components and Engineered Products are 
5

commodity products available from several domestic suppliers. Management believes that raw materials and component parts other than certain specialty products are available from alternative sources.
Our suppliers of raw materials and component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of the raw materials, such as steel, that they use to manufacture our raw materials and component parts. While we generally attempt to pass along increased raw material prices to our customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the price of our products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of our products due to various factors. See the discussion of risks associated with raw material supply and costs in Item 1A "Risk Factors".
Backlog
Management believes that backlog is not a meaningful measure for Supply Technologies, as a majority of Supply Technologies’ customers require just-in-time delivery of production components. Management believes that Assembly Components’ backlog is not a meaningful measure, as a significant portion of sales are on a release or firm order basis. The backlog of Engineered Products’ orders believed to be firm as of December 31, 2018 was $226.1 million, compared with $173.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Nearly all of Engineered Products’ backlog as of December 31, 2018 is scheduled to be shipped in 2019.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect public health and the environment, particularly with regard to discharges and emissions, as well as handling, storage, treatment and disposal of various substances and wastes. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil and criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, owners or operators of facilities may be liable for the costs of response or other corrective actions for contamination identified at or emanating from current or former locations, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any such contamination, and for related damages to natural resources. Additionally, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or materials may be liable for costs of response at sites where they are located, whether or not the site is owned or operated by such person.
From time to time, we have incurred, and are presently incurring, costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance and remediating environmental conditions at certain of our properties. In general, we have not experienced difficulty in complying with environmental laws in the past, and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Our capital expenditures on environmental control facilities were not material during the past five years and such expenditures are not expected to be material to us in the foreseeable future.
We are currently, and may in the future be, required to incur costs relating to the investigation or remediation of property, including property where we have disposed of our waste, and for addressing environmental conditions. For instance, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at third-party sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or comparable state laws, which provide for strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability. We are participating in the cost of certain clean-up efforts at several of these sites. The availability of third-party payments or insurance for environmental remediation activities is subject to risks associated with the willingness and ability of the third party to make payments. However, our share of such costs has not been material and, based on available information, we do not expect our exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.
