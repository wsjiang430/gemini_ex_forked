Item 1. Business.
 
References to “we,” “us,” “our”, “our company” and “the company” refer to Surge Components, Inc. (“Surge” or the “Company”) and, unless the context indicates otherwise, includes Surge’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Challenge/Surge, Inc. (“Challenge”), and Surge Components, Limited (“Surge Limited”).
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on November 24, 1981, and re-incorporated in Nevada on August 26, 2010. In February 2019, we converted into a Delaware corporation. We completed an initial public offering of our securities in 1984 and a second offering in August 1996. Our principal executive offices are located at 95 East Jefryn Boulevard, Deer Park, New York 11729 and our telephone number is (631) 595-1818.
 
We are a supplier of electronic products and components. These products include capacitors, which are electrical energy storage devices, and discrete components, such as semiconductor rectifiers, transistors and diodes, which are single function low power semiconductor products that are packaged alone as compared to integrated circuits such as microprocessors. The products that we sell are typically utilized in the electronic circuitry of diverse products, including, but not limited to, automobiles, telecomm, audio, cellular telephones, computers, consumer electronics, garage door openers, household appliances, power supplies and security equipment. The products that we sell are sold to both original equipment manufacturers, commonly referred to as OEMs, who incorporate them into their products, and to distributors of the lines of products we sell, who resell these products within their customer base. Surge sells its products through three of the top four distributors for electronic components in the world and also supplies its products to subcontractors who manufacture for their customers. These channels open doors to Surge at customers which Surge may not have access to otherwise. The products that we sell are manufactured predominantly in Asia by approximately sixteen independent manufacturers. We only have one binding long-term supply agreement with one of our manufacturers, Lelon Electronics. We have an agreement to act as the exclusive sales agent utilizing independent sales representative organizations in North America to sell and market the products for one of such manufacturers, Lelon Electronics. When we act as a sales agent, we receive a commission from our supplier who sold the product to the customer that we introduced to our supplier. The amount of the commission is determined on a sale by sale basis depending on the profit margin of the product. Commission revenue totaled $48,730 and $244,631 for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2018 (“Fiscal 2018”) and November 30, 2017 (“Fiscal 2017”), respectively.
 
Challenge is engaged in the sale of electronic components. In 1999, Challenge began as a division to sell audible components. We have been able to increase the types of products that we sell because some of our suppliers introduced new products, and we also located other products from new suppliers. Our core products include buzzers, speakers, microphones, resonators, alarms, chimes, filters, and discriminators. We now also work with our suppliers to have our suppliers customize many of the products we sell for many customers through the customers’ own designs and those that we work with our suppliers to have our suppliers redesign for them at our suppliers’ factories. We have an engineer on our staff who works with our suppliers on such redesigns and assists with the introduction of new product lines. We are continually looking to expand the line of products that we sell. We sell these products through independent representatives that earn a commission on the products we sell. We are also working with local, regional, and national distributors to sell these products to local accounts in every state. 
 
In order for us to grow, we will depend on, among other things, the continued growth of the electronics and semiconductor industries, our ability to withstand intense price competition, our ability to obtain new clients, our ability to retain and attract sales and other personnel in order to expand our marketing capabilities, our ability to secure adequate sources of products, which are in demand on commercially reasonable terms, our success in managing growth, including monitoring an expanded level of operations.
 
Industry Background
 
The United States electronics distribution industry is composed of manufacturers, national and international distributors, as well as regional and local distributors. Electronics distributors market numerous products, including active components (such as transistors, microprocessors, integrated circuits and semiconductors), passive components (such as capacitors and audibles), and electro mechanical, interconnect (such as connectors and wire) and computer products. Surge focuses its efforts on the sale of capacitors, discrete components, and audible products.

The electronics industry has been characterized by intense price cutting and rapid technological changes and development, which could materially adversely affect our future operating results. In addition, the industry has been affected historically by periodic economic downturns, which have had an adverse economic effect upon manufacturers and end-users of the products that we sell, as well as distributors. Furthermore, the life-cycle of existing electronic products and the timing of new product development and introduction can affect the demand for electronic components, including the products that we sell. Accordingly, any downturn in the electronics industry in general could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Due to rising transportation and employment costs in Asia, we have seen some U.S. manufacturers start moving their manufacturing facilities to Mexico to reduce transportation costs and bring manufacturing much closer to home. At this time, however, none of our customers has moved its manufacturing facilities to Mexico.
 
Products
 
Surge supplies a wide variety of electronic components (some of which bear our private “Surge” label) which can be broadly divided into two categories—capacitors and discrete components. For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, capacitors accounted for approximately 51% and 50% of Surge’s sales, respectively, of which approximately 75% for each year was Lelon capacitors (discussed below). Discrete components accounted for Surge’s remaining sales in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017. Capacitors and discrete components can be categorized based on various factors, including function, construction, fabrication and capacity. 
 
We sell, under the name of the manufacturer, Lelon Electronics, aluminum electrolytic capacitors, which are capacitors that store and release energy into a circuit incrementally and are used in various applications, including but not limited to, computers, appliances, automotive, lighting, telecommunications devices and various consumer products. Our sales of products under the Lelon Electronics name accounted for approximately 46% of our total sales (and approximately 75% of our capacitor sales as noted above) in Fiscal 2018. 
 
The principal products sold by Surge under the Surge name (except with respect to capacitors, which the Company also sells under the Lelon Electronics name as noted above) or by Challenge are set forth below.
 
Capacitors
 
A capacitor is an electrical energy storage device used in the electronics industry for varied applications, principally as elements of resonant circuits, coupling and bypass applications, blockage of DC current, frequency determining and timing elements, filters and delay-line components. All products are available in traditional leaded as well as surface mount (chip) packages. The product line of capacitors we sell includes:
 
Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors- These capacitors, which are Surge’s principal product, are storage devices used in power applications to store and release energy as the electronic circuitry demands. They are commonly used in power supplies and can be found in a wide range of consumer electronics products. Our supplier has one of the largest facilities for these products in Taiwan and China. These facilities are fully certified for the International Quality Standard ISO 9001 and QS9000, and TS16949, which means that they meet the strictest requirements established by the automotive industry and adopted throughout the world to ensure that the facility’s manufacturing processes, equipment and associated quality control systems will satisfy specific customer requirements. This system is also intended and designed to facilitate clear and thorough record keeping of all quality control and testing information and to ensure clear communication from one department to another about the information (i.e., quality control, production or engineering). This certification permits us to monitor quality control/manufacturing process information and to respond to any customer questions.
 
Ceramic Capacitors- These capacitors are the least expensive, and are widely used in the electronics industry. They are commonly used to bypass or filter semiconductors in resonant circuits and are found predominantly in a wide range of low cost products including computer, telecom, appliances, games and toys.
 
Mylar Film Capacitors- These capacitors are frequently used for noise suppression and filtering. They are commonly used in telecommunication and computer products. Surge’s suppliers in China have facilities fully certified for all of the above mentioned quality certifications.
 
Discrete Components
 
Discrete components, such as semiconductor rectifiers, transistors and diodes, are packaged individually to perform a single or limited function, in contrast to integrated circuits, such as microprocessors and other “chips”, which contain from only a few diodes to as many as several million diodes and other elements in a single package, and are usually designed to perform complex tasks. Surge almost exclusively distributes discrete, low power semiconductor components rather than integrated circuits.

The product line of discrete components we sell includes:
 
Rectifiers- Low power semiconductor rectifiers are devices that convert alternating current, or AC power, into one directional current, or DC power, by permitting current to flow in one direction only. They tend to be found in most electrical apparatuses, especially those drawing power from an AC wall outlet. All products are available in traditional leaded as well as surface mount (chip) packages. Surge’s rectifier suppliers all have the aforementioned certifications, giving us an opportunity to market the products that we sell to the automotive industry.
 
Transistors- These products send a signal to the circuit for transmission of waves. They are commonly used in applications involving the processing or amplification of electric current and electric signals, including data, television, sound and power. All products are available in traditional leaded as well as surface mount (chip) packages. Surge sells many types of ISO 9002 transistors, including power transistors, designed for large currents to safely dissipate large amounts of power.
 
Diodes- Diodes are two-lead or surface mount components that allow electric current to flow in only one direction. They are used in a variety of electronic applications, including signal processing and direction of current. All products are available in traditional leaded as well as surface mount (chip) packages. Diodes sold include:
 
Circuit Protection Devices- Our circuit protection devices include transient voltage suppressors and metal oxide varistors, which protect circuits against switching, lightning surges and other uncontrolled power surges and/or interruptions in circuits. Transient voltage suppressors, which offer a higher level of protection for the circuit, are required in telecommunication products and are typically higher priced products than the metal oxide varistors, which are more economically priced and are used in consumer products. All products are available in traditional leaded as well as surface mount (chip) packages.
 
Audible Components- These include audible transducers, Piezo buzzers, speakers, and microphones, which produce an audible sound for, and are used in back-up power supplies for computers, alarms, appliances, smoke detectors, automobiles, telephones and other products which produce sounds. Challenge has initiated marketing relationships with certain Asian manufacturers of audible components to sell these products worldwide. All products are available in traditional leaded as well as surface mount (chip) packages.
 
New Products- We periodically introduce new products, which are intended to complement our existing product lines. These products are ones that are commonly used in the same circuit designs as other of the products that we sell and will further provide a one- stop-shop for the customer. Some of these products are common items used in all applications and others are niche items with a focus towards a particular application. These new products include fuses, printed circuit boards and switches. All products are available in traditional leaded as well as surface mount (chip) versions.
 
Inventory
 
In order to adequately service our customers’ needs, we believe that it is necessary to maintain large inventories, which makes us more susceptible to price and technology changes. At any given time, we attempt to maintain a one-to-two month inventory on certain products in high demand for customers and at least one month for other products. Our inventory currently contains more than 100 million component units consisting of more than 3,000 different part numbers. The products that we sell range in sales price from less than one cent for a commercial diode to more than $2.00 for high power capacitors and semiconductors. As of November 30, 2018, we maintained inventory valued at $3,389,065.
 
Because of the experience of our management, including Ira Levy and Steven Lubman, we believe that we know the best prices to buy the products we sell and as a result we generally waive rights to manufacturers’ inventory protection agreements (including price protection and inventory return rights), and thereby bear the risk of increases in the prices charged by our manufacturers and decreases in the prices of products held in our inventory or covered by purchase commitments. If prices of components, which we hold in inventory decline, or if new technology is developed that displaces products that we sell, our business could be materially adversely affected. The Company has experienced very little impact from customer design changes and slowdown but this can potentially increase due to economic conditions and customer-specific business conditions. If our customers experience these changes, our business could be adversely affected.
 
Product Availability
 
Surge and Challenge obtain substantially all of their products from manufacturers in Asia. However, in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, Challenge purchased approximately 94% and 95%, respectively, of its products overseas as a result of Challenge’s introduction of new product lines. Of the total goods purchased by Surge and Challenge in Fiscal 2018, those foreign manufactured products were supplied from manufacturers in Taiwan (49%), Hong Kong (18%), elsewhere in Asia (30%) and overseas outside of Asia (less than 1%). The Company purchases its products from approximately sixteen different manufacturers.

Most of the facilities that manufacture products for Surge have obtained International Quality Standard ISO 9002 and other certifications. We typically purchase the products that we sell in United States currency in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations. In most cases, Surge utilizes two or more alternative sources of supply for each of its products with one primary and one complementary supplier for each product. Surge’s relationships with many of its suppliers date back to the commencement of our import operations in 1983. We have established payment terms with our manufacturers of between 30 and 60 day open account terms.
 
We only have one agreement with a supplier, Lelon Electronics, which is terminable by either party upon six months’ notice to the other party. We have an agreement to act as the sales agent in North America for one of our manufacturers, Lelon Electronics. While we believe that we have established close working relationships with our principal manufacturers, our success depends, in large part, on maintaining these relationships and developing new supplier relationships for our existing and future product lines. Because of the lack of long- term contracts, we may not be able to maintain these relationships.
 
For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, one of Surge’s vendors, Lelon Electronics, accounted for approximately 46% and 49% of Surge’s consolidated purchases. The loss of or a significant disruption in the relationship with Lelon Electronics, which is our major supplier, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations until a suitable replacement could be obtained.
 
The Company has a written agreement with Lelon Electronics regarding the supply of inventory for the Company’s customers. The Company purchases products under both the Company’s name and Lelon’s brand name for the Company’s inventory in order to supply the Company’s customers. For the majority of purchases from Lelon Electronics, the Company takes title to the products, houses them in the Company’s warehouse and sells directly to the Company’s customers. There is no right of return on the products purchased from Lelon and the Company accepts all credit risk with regards to sales of these products. 
 
The components business has, from time to time, experienced periods of shortages in product supply, usually as the result of demand exceeding available supply. When these shortages occur, suppliers tend to either increase prices and or reduce the number of units sold to given customers. Should there be shortages in the future, such shortages may benefit our business if we get preferential supply from our manufacturers. It could also have an adverse effect upon our business, in the case that our manufacturers don’t have enough capacity to provide enough components. Conversely, due to poor market demand, there could be an excess of components in the market, causing stronger competition and an erosion of prices. While our manufacturing partners are experiencing extended delivery times we believe that these delivery times are less than the delivery times experienced by its competitors. This has caused a slower ramp up in new business because of the longer lead time necessary to get products to customers. We expect this trend to continue at least through mid-2019.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Surge’s sales efforts are directed towards Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers in numerous industries where the products that we sell have wide application. Surge currently employs twelve sales and marketing personnel, not including two of its executive officers, who are responsible for certain key customer relationships.
 
We use independent sales representatives or organizations, which often specialize in specific products and areas and have specific knowledge of and contacts in particular markets. We currently have representation agreements with approximately 30 sales representative organizations. Sales representative organizations, which are generally paid a 5% commission on net sales, are generally responsible in their respective geographic markets for identifying customers and soliciting customer orders. Pursuant to arrangements with our independent sales representatives, they are permitted to represent other electronics manufacturers, but are generally prohibited from carrying a line of products competitive with the products that we sell. These arrangements can be terminated on written notice by either party or if breached by either party. These organizations normally employ between one and twelve sales representatives. The individual sales representatives employed by the sales organizations generally possess an expertise which enhances the scope of our marketing and sales efforts. This permits us to avoid the significant costs associated with creating a direct marketing network. We have had relationships with certain sales organizations since 1988 and continue to engage new sales organizations as needed. We believe that additional sales organizations and representatives are available to us, if required.
 
We have initiated a formal national distribution program to attract more distributors to promote the products that we sell. We expect this market segment to contribute significantly to our sales growth over time.
 
Many customers require their suppliers to have a local presence and Surge’s network of independent sales representatives are responsive to these needs. Surge formed a Hong Kong corporation, Surge Components, Limited and hired a regional sales manager to service the Hong Kong/Greater China region customers.

Other marketing efforts include generation and distribution of catalogs and brochures of the products we sell and attendance at trade shows. We have produced an exhibit for display at electronics trade shows throughout the year. The products that we sell have been exhibited at the electronic distribution show in Las Vegas, and we intend to continue our commitment and focus on the distribution segment of the industry by our visibility at the Electronic Distributor Trade Show. In addition, we have updated our website to make it more informative and user friendly. Our search engines have been improved so that customers can find us more easily and we have developed a new portal system to help with lead management and disbursement.
 
Customers
 
The products that we sell are sold to distributors and OEMs in such diverse industries as the automotive, computer, communications, cellular telephones, consumer electronics, garage door openers, security equipment, audio equipment, telecomm products, computer related products, power supply products, utility meters and household appliances industries. We request our distributors to provide point of sales reporting, which enables us to gain knowledge of the breakdown of industries into which the products that we sell are sold. One of our customers, , accounted for 13% of net sales for Fiscal 2018, and one of our customers accounted for 12% of net sales for Fiscal 2017. Our discrete components are often sold to the same clients as our capacitors. These OEM customers typically accept samples for evaluation and, if approved, we work towards procuring the next orders for these items.
 
Typically, we do not maintain contracts with our customers and generally sell products pursuant to customer purchase orders. Although our customer base has increased, the loss of our largest customers as well as, to a lesser extent, the loss of any other material customer, could have a materially adverse effect on our operations during the short-term until we are able to generate replacement business, although we may not be able to obtain such replacement business. Because of our contracts and good working relationships with our distributors, we offer the OEMs, when purchasing through distributors, extended payment terms, just-in- time deliveries and one-stop shopping for many types of electronic products. 
 
Settlement Agreement
 
On December 22, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Michael D. Tofias and Bradley P. Rexroad (collectively, the “Stockholders”). The Settlement Agreement generally provided that:

● | the Board and the Stockholders will identify a mutually acceptable independent director to join the Board as a Class C director by February 28, 2017 and the Board will include that new director among its director nominees for the 2017 annual meeting; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Company will take all steps to (i) change its state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware and (ii) declassify the Board on a rolling basis by June 30, 2017, and the Company will convene a special meeting of stockholders of the Company for the purpose of approving such actions, at which meeting the Stockholders and the Insiders will vote all of their shares of common stock of the Company in favor of such actions, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Company will commence an issuer tender offer to all of its stockholders to repurchase at least 5.0 million shares of its common stock at a price of $1.43 per share (the “Tender Offer”), which the Company completed in March 2017 whereby it purchased for cash 5,000,000 shares of its common stock, at a price of $1.43 per share, or $7,150,000. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | the Stockholders will tender all of the shares of common stock of the Company that they hold beneficially or of record in the Tender Offer, subject to limited exceptions; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Company’s officers and directors will not participate in the Tender Offer and will not transfer or sell any of their shares until six months after the Tender Offer is completed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company also agreed to reimburse the expenses of the Stockholders associated with their investment in the Company, including their proxy solicitation and litigation costs, in an amount not to exceed $300,000.
 
On April 6, 2017, the Board of Directors elected Peter Levy as a Class C Director. He is an independent director.
 
On October 4, 2018, the Company held its annual meeting of shareholders, at which shareholders approved (i) the change in the Company’s state of incorporation from Nevada to Delaware and (ii) the declassification of the Company’s board of directors on a rolling basis. No shareholders exercised their dissenters’ rights in connection with the reincorporation proposal. The Company was reincorporated in Delaware on February 5, 2019.
 
Competition
 
We conduct business in the highly competitive electronic components industry. We expect this industry to remain competitive. We face intense competition in both our selling efforts and purchasing efforts from the many companies that manufacture or distribute electronic components. Our principal competitors in the sale of capacitors include Nichicon, Panasonic, Illinois Capacitor, NIC, AVX, Murata, Epcos, United Chemicon, Rubycon, Vishay and Kemet. Our principal competitors in the sale of discrete components include Vishay, General Semiconductor Division, General Instrument Corp., OnSemi, Inc., Microsemi Corp., Diodes, Inc. and Littlefuse, and Copper Bussman Division. Our principal competition in the audible business include AVX, Murata, Panasonic, Projects Unlimited, International Components Corp. and Star Micronics. Many of these companies are well established with substantial expertise, and have much greater assets and greater financial, marketing, personnel, and other resources than we do. Many larger competing suppliers also carry product lines which we do not carry. Generally, large semiconductor manufacturers and distributors do not focus their direct selling efforts on small to medium sized OEMs and distributors, which constitute many of our customers. As our customers become larger, and as the market becomes more competitive, our competitors may find it beneficial to focus direct selling efforts on those customers, which could result in our facing increased competition, the loss of customers or pressure on our profit margins. We are finding increased competition from manufacturers located in Asia due to the increased globalization nature of the business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors. Other factors that will affect our success in these markets include our continued ability to attract additional experienced marketing, sales and management talent, and our ability to expand our support, training and field service capabilities. Additionally, since the tsunami and earthquake in Japan in 2012, our competitors have established manufacturing facilities in China enabling them to be more competitive by lowering their labor rates and manufacturing costs. Also, as the world continues to become global and customers have easier access to suppliers in Asia, our business could be adversely affected since foreign suppliers are traveling to the United States and interacting with customers more often, where previously they communicated via long-distance. Also, the internet enables customers to meet and interact with suppliers through Google and other search engines which customers had not previously done.
Customer Service
 
We have customer service employees whose time is dedicated largely to responding to customer inquiries such as price quote requests, delivery status of new or existing purchase orders, changes of existing order dates, quantities, dates, etc. We intend to increase our customer service capabilities, as necessary.
Foreign Trade Regulation
 
Most products sold by Surge are manufactured in Asia, including such countries as Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, India, Japan and China. The purchase of goods manufactured in foreign countries is subject to a number of risks, including economic disruptions, transportation delays and interruptions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, impositions of tariffs and import and export controls, and changes in governmental policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Potential concerns may include drastic devaluation of currencies, loss of supplies and increased competition within the region.

From time to time, protectionist pressures have influenced United States trade policy concerning the imposition of significant duties or other trade restrictions upon foreign products. We cannot predict whether additional United States customs quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign components in the future or what effect such actions could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Our ability to remain competitive with respect to the pricing of imported components could be adversely affected by increases in tariffs or duties, changes in trade treaties, strikes in air or sea transportation, and possible future United States legislation with respect to pricing and import quotas on products from foreign countries. Our ability to remain competitive could also be affected by other governmental actions related to, among other things, anti-dumping legislation and international currency fluctuations. While we do not believe that any of these factors adversely impact our business at the present time, there can be no assurance that these factors will not materially adversely affect us in the future. Since July 2018, when tariffs started to impact some of the Company’s sales, the Company has been able to pass on the tariffs to its U.S. and Canadian customers. We have also changed our shipping terms with our Mexico customers to Free Carrier, which means we deliver the goods to the customers’ Hong Kong freight forwarder, who then becomes responsible for the transportation and tariff costs. Any significant disruption in the delivery of merchandise from our suppliers, substantially all of whom are foreign, could have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
 
Government Regulation
 
Various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, are applicable to our company. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding safe working conditions. We believe that the cost of compliance with such governmental regulations is not material.
 
We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the Company’s knowledge, none of our employees or other agents have engaged in such practices.
 
The Company has been impacted by the tariffs in effect or being considered by the United States to impose on Chinese goods being imported into the United States, which includes the Company’s products. The imposition of such tariffs will likely cause our costs, as well as the prices we charge customers, to increase.
 
Environmental and Regulatory Compliance
 
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the handling and management of certain chemicals used in electronic components.
 
We do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Information
 
In September 2018, we filed a U.S. patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for an improved pinpoint alarm designed to improve an individual’s ability to determine the location of an alarm versus standard single, multi-frequency, or broadband alarms. The improved alarm can be used in a wide variety of applications, including reversing vehicles, medical emergency notification, and hardware devices that use Bluetooth or other wireless communications protocols in combination with mobile software applications to locate lost items, including phones, wallets, and keys. To the best of our knowledge, the manufacturers of the products that we sell do not have patents, trademarks or copyrights registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Officer or in any state. We rely on the know-how, experience and capabilities of our management personnel. Although we believe that the products do not and will not infringe patents or trademarks, or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of existing or future patents, trademarks or proprietary rights of others may occur. In the event that the products that we sell infringe proprietary rights of others, these products may have to be modified or redesigned by the manufacturer of these products. However, there can be no assurance that any infringing products will be able to be modified or redesigned in a way that does not infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could have a material adverse effect upon our operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action. Moreover, if the products we sell infringe patents, trademarks or proprietary rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Backlog
 
As of November 30, 2018, our backlog was approximately $11,294,000, as compared with $8,189,000 at November 30, 2017. Substantially all backlog is expected to be shipped by us within 180 days of year end. Year to year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
Employees
 
As of November 30, 2018, Surge and Challenge employed 36 persons, two of whom are employed in executive capacities, twelve are engaged in sales, three in engineering, two in purchasing, five in administrative capacities, six in customer service, two in accounting and four in warehousing. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
