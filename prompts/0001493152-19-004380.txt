ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Summary
 
Sigma is a software company that has developed In-Process-Quality-Assurance (“IPQA”) software known as PrintRite3D®. This technology is also sometimes referred to as Real-Time-Computer-Aided Inspection (“CAI”). Sigma believes that its PrintRite3D® solves the major problem that has prevented large-scale metal part production using 3D printers for cost efficient production runs.
 
3D metal manufacturing, also known as Additive Manufacturing, is a technology that uses lasers to sculpt parts by welding powdered metals into 3-dimensional (3D) objects and, to date, the quality of these parts can vary from part to part in a single production run, as well as from machine to machine in a production line. Traditional quality assurance methods relying on statistically based post-process inspection methods so well proven by “Subtractive Manufacturing” cannot be used effectively to improve and assure quality of parts manufactured using 3D metal printers. The aforementioned traditional quality assurance methods are based on a manufacturing process that is the opposite of 3D Additive Manufacturing; Subtractive Manufacturing begins with quality-assured already formed pieces of metal as a raw material (not powdered metal as is used as raw material in 3D) and machines it with equipment such as lathes, milling machines, and CNC machines to subtract metal and thus form finished metal parts, or by casting molten metal into molded parts usually to then be further machined. Since the metal used in Subtractive Manufacturing is already of proven quality, the quality of the metal for all parts in a production run is known to be uniform, subject to post process inspection of a statistically determined valid sample size focused primarily on metrology to determine dimensional accuracy rather than metallurgy to determine metal quality.
 
The lynchpin reality of 3D Additive Manufacturing quality assurance is illustrated by the fact that if a 3D metal manufacturing machine fabricates 10 parts, and quality inspectors then rigorously inspect three of them, the inspectors will have learned about the quality of only the three parts they destroyed or CT-scanned and nothing that is sufficient to confirm or reject the quality of the remaining seven. Quality assurance of 3D Additive metal parts requires high quality sensitive manufacturers to institute procedures to inspect 100% of the parts being made. Sigma believes that the best, indeed, the only known way to attain high yields for both manufacturing quality and cost efficiency is an In-Process-Quality-Assurance (IPQA®) approach that examines each part in real time as it is being manufactured, determines in real time whether it meets quality specifications and permits machine operators to act on the information if a part is beginning to deviate from its design specifications.
 
GE Aviation stated in 2016 that it planned to commit $3.5 billion by 2020 to, among other things, build a metal 3D production facility to produce 3D printed metal parts for its Leap engine and other engines. Starting in September 2016 and continuing into 2017 GE Additive spent over $1 billion buying controlling interests in AM equipment manufacturers, Concept Laser and Arcam AB, and later announced that it had invested over $300 million creating AM manufacturing capability in both the United States and India, and was an investor in a $115 million series D investment round of Desktop Metal, a metal 3D printing company. In the course of 2017, GE Additive continued with lateral growth into additive manufacturing, announcing collaborations with Oerlikon and Stryker, and then a partnership with GKN. Sigma Labs has learned from its interactions in the marketplace that the pent-up demand apparent from GE and others, such as Airbus, to press forward into advanced 3D manufacturing production are taking place with the assumption that highly reliable in-process quality assurance capability will no doubt emerge either from their own internal efforts or be attained through licensing, or possibly acquisition. In the meantime, CT scans and other costly post-process inspection appear to be an accepted cost as initially sustainable in the startup phases of production. However, until companies that utilize 3D production facilities like GE Aviation are able to effectively verify that each part conforms to design specifications of attributes of shape, density, strength and consistency in real-time during the manufacturing process, we believe that such companies will be at risk of letting some substandard parts through and, also, be unable to improve the workflow to high quality cost-optimum yields of 3D printed metal parts. No matter how much acuity and at what cost a suite of post process inspection tools might provide 3D manufactured metal parts, it currently can only assure quality yield by rejecting fully formed parts, and, over time, applying comprehensive ‘reverse engineering’ forensic analyses of each rejected part to identify repeating quality flaws attributable to constants such as location, design, or scan strategy. Once the locations of these repeating flaws are identified, process engineers can act to make the AM equipment deliver better quality by adjusting the computer-based manufacturing instructions of AM equipment to offset the repeating flaws discovered by that deep analyses of individual rejected parts in many manufacturing runs. This prolonged post-process methodology is very costly due to the loss of material and rejected parts as well as post-process analysis labor cost and inspection cost such as CT scanning. Additionally, there still lingers the question of whether or not the post-process inspections were sufficiently granular to assure that flawed parts were not accepted and shipped.
 
We believe that our principal product, PrintRite3D®, which can be installed on 3D metal printers, solves these problems by determining if each part is being made to the metallurgical quality specifications of the Design/Specification file as each part is being made. Our software enables 3D prototyping to evolve forward into serial or production 3D manufacturing by providing a software suite with algorithm-based tools that address and overcome quality issues that are specific to 3D Metal Additive Manufacturing and that are not solved using the post-production quality methods derived for Subtractive manufacturing along with and newly dependent upon CT scanning. The PrintRite3D® suite has substantially lower operating costs and can attain higher yields by inspecting parts as they are made and providing machines and their operators actionable information that includes the options of stopping manufacture of given part(s) while operations continue to complete parts that are in specification, thus saving time and money while raising yields. PrintRite3D® also gives operators information from run to run that enables them to ‘learn up’ quality for a given machine by using PrintRite3D® data about machine behaviors that can then be offset by making adjustments to power settings directed at a given sector. PrintRite3D®’s Thermal Energy Density™ (“TED”) feature supersedes and truncates the “reverse engineering” process of post process inspection described above by providing process engineers the data required to optimize individual machines as well as machines in series in days or weeks and before serial production is launched rather than months after production and rejection rates have accrued in costly quantities. PrintRite3D®’s Thermal Energy Planck (“TEP”) feature provides machine operators and engineers with in process real-time identification of signatures of quality anomalies as they begin to develop and permits terminating or curing a part in process.

We have filed 24 patents/patent applications pending on our In-Process Quality Assurance™ (“IPQA®”) processes and procedures for advanced manufacturing. In addition, we anticipate that our core PrintRite3D® software will enable our customers to combine their digital manufacturing technologies with our 3D manufacturing QA to achieve both cost savings and more reliable parts. We believe that certain vertical markets would benefit from our technology and software, including aerospace, defense, bio-medical, power generation, and oil & gas industries because: (1) they each stand to benefit by taking advantage of the weight/strength/performance ratios that can often be optimized by taking advantage of 3D design; (2) they each stand to benefit by taking maximum advantage of 3D manufacturing’s material cost savings resulting from designing parts to needed tolerances while requiring less metal; and (3) there are severe consequences for quality failures in some of their products. We provide our software products to customers in the form of Software as a Service (“SaaS”), as well as in custom arrangements.
 
About 3D Printing
 
3D printing (“3DP”) or additive manufacturing (“AM”) is changing the manufacturing world by producing complex metal parts from a computerized input. 3D printing has been applied to the manufacture of plastic parts for decades. 3D manufacturing of metal parts involves directing a laser or other energy source at a layer of powdered metal and melting it. These layers become melted together from the bottom up. Worldwide revenues attributable to 3D manufacturing for metal products were reported at $88.1 million in 2015 (Wohlers Report 2016, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing State of the Industry – Annual Worldwide Progress Report). By 2017, Wohlers Report stopped estimating annual 3D metal parts revenue, stating that too much of the revenue is proprietary information and unavailable from aerospace and similar high-tech sectors. Large powdered metal suppliers surveyed by Wohlers about their growth forecasts for 2017 averaged expectations of a 59% increase for 2017. According to Sigma’s experience in costing and pricing the manufacturing of AM metal parts, as confirmed by consultation with other service providers, the total powdered metal sales forecast for 2017 is enough raw material to produce a “retail value” of the metal parts of ~$800 million. On another vector, according to Wohlers, an estimated 1,768 metal AM machines were sold in 2017, an increase of 79% over 2016. As large established companies including Toshiba, HP, Lenovo, Canon and Ricoh in the course of 2016-2017 announced products or intents of entry in AM manufacturing, Electro Optical Systems (“EOS”), a well-established vendor of AM manufacturing equipment opened a new plant in January 2018 that, according to EOS, doubled its 2017 capacity to 1,000 units per year. SLM Solutions AG also reportedly expanded into a new factory during this period.
About Quality Assurance in 3D Printing
 
Sigma believes that the largest future growth for the 3D printing industry will be in metal parts, given the interest and investment being made by Fortune 100 companies, Federal government laboratories and agencies as well as university-based institutions. These high-end manufacturers and technology leaders are strongly focused on helping transform analog manufacturing of precision, high-tolerance parts in the U.S. to digital manufacturing encompassing automation, robotics and closed-loop process control. We believe that the future growth and success of 3D printing for metal parts will be highly dependent upon the availability of in-process and real-time digital quality assurance tools, such as our PrintRite3D®.
 
Current methods for providing quality in 3DP are generally either (i) inaccurate due to use of procedures that do not recognize and measure the primary quality issues of 3D metal manufacturing or due to the misuse of non-applicable statistically based assessments, or (ii) are cost prohibitive due to the expense of labor and equipment required to examine the interior of complex dense parts that 3D manufacturing can create after the parts are manufactured. After 3D-manufacture, costs are normally incurred for using non-destructive technologies such as ultrasound and non-traditional CT technology on these parts, and old-fashioned visual inspection. Destructive testing of 3D parts is a mis-applied carryover from current Subtractive Manufacturing quality assurance practice, in which the great part to part consistency of traditional metal machining equipment permits quality inspectors to infer the quality of a production run by cutting up and analyzing a statistically relevant number of parts. The test result of the parts that are destroyed and analyzed have too often been, after great time and expense, statistically demonstrated to be insufficiently representative of the rest of the parts in the production lot. The underlying premise of quality assurance for Subtractive Manufactured parts is that if a machine is set up properly, then all parts it produces will be repeatedly the same. This simple, effective and accurate quality system does not apply to Additive Manufacturing, in which each part is built in an average production lot of 5-80, and in which quality variance may occur from part to part and within any part notwithstanding that the AM machine settings are the same. Therefore, unable to rely on a traditional statistically based quality system, 3D Manufacturing’s optimum quality assurance system would evaluate the quality of each individual part. PrintRite3D®’s in-process quality inspection approach of each part individually allows a manufacturer to use AM to form a single part, such as a hip replacement or one spare aircraft part needed on an aircraft carrier, or several lots of the same part, in large quality – each approved or rejected in real time and based upon complete inspection during fabrication. We offer our customers the ability to use real-time sensors to track individual scans of each layer, and our software continuously analyzes the part health so that both during and after it is finished, we can determine if it meets the production parameters of quality standard set by the customer. We believe our PrintRite3D® software could reduce inspection costs by as much as a factor of 10 and development time for new parts by 50% or more because IPQA permits factories to make the part manufactured the constant and the machines manufacturing them the variable. Consequently, the lower cost statistical based post-process inspection methods that work well with Subtractive Manufacturing could be successfully and economically applied to parts made with 3D Metal machines, and because utilizing PrintRite3D® for design reduces the number and iterations of development parts required to lead to a final design. Also important is the ability of our software to reduce risk associated with the qualification and certification of printed parts.

By using PrintRite3D® software, a high-precision manufacturer would have the ability to offer its customers product warranties and assurances that its printed parts were produced in compliance with stringent quality requirements. Orders for our software have been received from, among others, Honeywell Aerospace, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Woodward, Siemens Turbomachinery, Pratt and Whitney, Baker Hughes, and Solar Turbines.
 
We believe there is potential for our PrintRite3D® software to be incorporated into a majority of 3D metal printing devices made by companies like Electro-Optical Systems (“EOS”), Additive Industries, ARCAM, Concept Lasers, Farsoon, Desktop Metal, DMG Mori, Renishaw, Sentrol, SLM, Trumpf Lasers, and others.
 
Sigma’s Cloud-Based IIoT Solutions
 
The process of making a 3D printed part could start with our customers loading a computer aided design (“CAD”) model of the part into the Cloud as shown in “A” in Figure 1. Next, computer aided engineering (“CAE”) and/or computer aided manufacturing (“CAM”) instructions are sent to the 3D printer (see “B”, as shown in Figure 1). Metal powder in the machine is then deposited onto the build platform where a laser beam, or other energy source, focused onto the build platform melts each successive layer of powder in 20-60 micron increments. Our PrintRite3D SENSORPAK® (see “C” in Figure 1) detects, records, analyzes and compares the part as it is being made layer-by-layer against the CAD/CAM specifications and physical reference points for quality assurance during manufacturing. Our PrintRite3D INSPECT®, Version 3.02 software utilizes our patent applied for TED tool to determine compliance of each part for its metallurgical quality. Our alpha version of PrintRite3D CONTOUR® software determines the shape and conformity of a part in real-time manufacture with its geometric design specification.
 
Our PrintRite3D® CAI web-based software suite (see “D” in Figure 1) resides in situ and/or in the Cloud (see “A” in Figure 1) of the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”). We enable manufacturing engineers to confirm the part quality layer-by-layer, provide for manufacturing statistical process control and harvest, aggregate, and analyze big data from the real-time manufacturing data collected from our PrintRite3D SENSORPAK® (see “C” in Figure 1), as well as post-process manufacturing data collected by our customers (see “E” in Figure 1).
 
Our specialized sensor suite (see “C” in Figure 1), known as PrintRite3D SENSORPAK®, is an edge computing device, which means that it can be operated outside of a customer’s primary computer hardware and software systems while delivering actionable information to these systems. Thus, PrintRite3D SENSORPAK® contains the modular hardware and software necessary to connect to “cyber-physical” objects (see “B” in Figure 1) living on the manufacturing floor. It allows for bi-directional information flow between the manufacturing floor and the Cloud (see “A” in Figure 1). It starts with a million-fold data reduction required to manage and analyze the very large quantities of data garnered that layer by layer monitoring +/- 30 Micron thicknesses create. It finishes with our PrintRite3D® Digital Quality Record (“DQR”) and report, which provides customers with product guarantees and assurances that parts were produced in compliance with stringent quality standards. It can collect, analyze, aggregate, filter, and then further communicate data from the manufacturing floor to the Cloud (see “A” in Figure 1) and enable links to other areas (see “F” in Figure 1) of the IIoT.

Business Activities and Industry Applications
 
Our business is currently focused on the continued development and commercialization of our PrintRite3D® suite of software applications. We are specifically focusing on the 3D Metal Printing and AM industries and further developing our contract additive manufacturing business for metal 3DP to be a customer prototype center available for cutting edge 3D challenges and a concurrent means of demonstrating and proving the merit of PrintRite3D® for customers’ parts or application. Our strategy is to continue to leverage our advanced manufacturing knowledge, experience and capabilities through the following means:

We generate revenues through PrintRite3D® hardware and CAI software licensing of our PrintRite3D® technology to customers that seek to improve their manufacturing production processes, and through ongoing annual software upgrades and maintenance fees. Additionally, we generate modest revenues from our contract manufacturing activities in metal AM. By running a small-scale contract AM services operation, we are able to understand and keep pace with the current needs and technology trends of our customers and where they are going with their next-generation product development efforts. Contract AM further allows us a means for material on-going partial self-funding of our IPQA®-enabled R&D and product development activities for CAI software. We provide our AM contract manufacturing services to customers in the form of Quality as a Service (“QaaS”). Starting with our PrintRite3D® cloud-based SaaS model, customers will contract with us for CAE, CAM and CAI services to generate and establish a Digital Quality Record (DQR) for AM built parts. Each DQR is cloud-based and allows for archiving and storage of quality data, access to our big data ANALYTICS™ software App for continuous quality monitoring and improvement, and automatic industry benchmarking while maintaining firewalls between company-specific data.
 
In late November 2018 at the Formnext tradeshow, we released a new version of our hardware along Version 4.0 of PrintRite3D and we also launched a Rapid Test and Evaluation(RTE) program for the market. The RTE targets high technology quality sensitive companies that are already manufacturing or buying parts manufactured in production runs on AM metal machines. The program is a “try before you buy” agreement under the terms of which customers enter into an agreement under which they agree to pay Sigma a fee, equivalent to a down payment, and to with test protocol mutually defined to demonstrate both Sigma’s technology capability in general and the measurable impact it can have on the customer’s’ processes, parts and yields. The Company’s goal is that successes in the RTE program will lead to increased revenues in 2019.
 
In October 2018, Mark Cola, our former President and Chief Technology Officer and a co-founder of the Company, retired with the title CTO Emeritus and an on-going consulting arrangement with the Company. In November 2018, Darren Beckett was named Chief Technology Officer of Sigma.
 
PrintRite3D® Quality Assurance Software for Computer-Aided Inspection of Metal Additive Manufacturing
 
We believe that AM will significantly impact the manufacturing landscape. AM results in very efficient metal utilization for parts made on-demand, and utilizes a wide variety of rapid prototyping methods. As a result of AM, parts can go straight from computer-aided designs (CAD) and 3D computer models to actual, physical parts through the use of computer-aided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) steps. However, there are severe challenges in connection with 3D printing of metal parts. Current manufacturing processes are not capable of making every part right the first time. Also, process consistency and repeatability require further development for metal parts and this is a typical case for emerging technologies. Although many industry experts have lamented that 3D Printing for metal parts is limited in current applications, we are developing our IPQA®-enabled technology into a hardware and software suite of products for CAI of AM known as PrintRite3D®, which we expect will address some of these shortcomings and enable mass production metals AM technology to be realized sooner than would otherwise be possible given its current state of maturity. PrintRite3D® comprises a suite of CAI software apps that address the three fundamental problems facing metal AM today, namely: assuring the metal integrity or quality of the product; assuring the as-built geometry of the product; and, increasing the productivity or speed of the AM process.

Contract Manufacturing for Metal Additive Manufacturing
 
According to the Wohlers 2018 Annual Report, industry growth in the independent service provider segment including the secondary market of dies and molds produced for and by AM machines for AM manufacturing in 2017 was an estimated $4.2 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2015. Large end-users such as Airbus, GE Aviation (“GEA”), Honeywell Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Siemens Turbomachinery have substantial investment and floor space dedicated to AM systems that supply production parts. Since 2016, the market has seen manufactures including EOS, Concept Laser, SLM, Trumpf, Additive Industries, DMG Mori, and Renishaw introduce and/or announce multi-laser equipment aimed specifically at enabling and furthering more cost-efficient and high-speed serial metal parts production.
 
We believe that this service provider market segment represents an opportunity for us to capture significant future portions of the demand for metal production parts by enhancing service bureaus quality through the licensing of PrintRite3D®.
 
A detailed description of our technologies and business follows.
 
PrintRite3D® Quality Assurance Software for Additive Manufacturing
 
The Market
 
The sale of AM products and services in 2017 composed of all AM products and services, but not including either internal investments of many of the major companies in aerospace AM or revenues from many companies in the aerospace, medical, and dental industries, grew 21% to $7.3 billion according to Wohler’s Annual 2018 report. Notwithstanding the exclusions just cited from its 2017 Industry Revenue estimate, Wohlers did attribute $721 million in 2017 revenues to sales of AM metal manufacturing machines. In 2018, Wohlers Associates forecasted 2019 AM Industry sales of $11.7 billion, growing to $27.3 billion in 2023. The fact that raw material revenues are growing at roughly double the percentage rate of machine sales suggests a significant increase in parts production.
 
A report in a series by Deloitte University Press on additive manufacturing published in Fall 2015 titled, “3D Opportunity For Quality Assurance and Parts Qualification,” states that, “[o]ne of the most important barriers is the qualification of AM-produced parts. So crucial is this issue, in fact, that many characterize quality assurance (QA) as the single biggest hurdle to widespread adoption of AM technology, particularly for metal.” We believe that the aforementioned article is as true today as it was four years ago. OEM end user companies as well as first-tier suppliers are still unable to achieve their long-term AM production goals without advanced quality assurance and control technologies for metal AM parts because current quality control methods are still not sufficient to reliably allow cost-effective manufacturing of safety- and performance-critical metal parts. We believe that our 2018 PrintRite3D® technology directly addresses this “important barrier” for metal parts and allow such AM applications to move forward. In response to this need, we have experienced an increase in our installed base of PrintRite3D® systems and we are beginning to provide material and process engineering services and support for our PrintRite3D® software through our recently established Rapid Test and Evaluation Program, mentioned above under “Business Activities and Industry Applications.”
 
Technology and Competitive Advantage
 
The evolution of AM from prototyping to volume manufacturing in production runs is occurring in, and led by, aerospace while also appearing in niche products such as medical appliances and replacement parts of diverse applications, including unavailable parts required by still deployed but aging technologies. A major problem for 3D metal products production-run manufacturing today is that traditional quality systems that rely heavily on other industries’ experiences with high precision CNC machines in Subtractive Manufacturing that lathe, mill, or drill with high precision consistency and can successfully rely on after-manufacture statistically based part sample destruction and inspection procedures simply do not export and apply to Additive manufacturing machines. Further, post-production non-destructive test instruments from ultrasound to CT Scans are either not effective or not cost efficient on many complex part configurations that take advantage of 3D capability, and in the case of CT scans, are prohibitively expensive for production cost efficiency. The most important feature of our PrintRite3D® is that it develops actionable quality and process data in real-time and, when no flaws are detected, can provide manufacturers and their end-users with a part-by-part quality certification backed up by a file of supporting data.

Our PrintRite3D® suite, as described below, is composed of hardware, software, data analytics, and proprietary algorithms. The hardware is an array of photodiodes, non-contact pyrometer, and a data processing unit that can be either sold with an AM manufacturing machine unit by an OEM manufacturer or retrofitted on customers’ sites.
 

● | PrintRite3D® SENSORPAK™ – the auxiliary sensor and hardware kit that sits on every AM machine to collect the data to drive the software. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PrintRite3D® INSPECT™ – software which verifies quality layer by layer. 

 
The following software modules are currently in development:
 

● | PrintRite3D® CONTOUR™ – software which assures the as-built geometry. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PrintRite3D® ANALYTICS™ – software that harvests, aggregates, and analyzes big data from in-process manufacturing data and post-process manufacturing data. 
● | PrintRite3D® THERMAL™ – software which predicts the residual stress and distortion in the part. 
● | PrintRite3D® CLOSED LOOP CONTROL- software that signals for laser adjustments required to correct a developing deviance from design specification detected by other PrintRite3D® modules. 

 
The proprietary software and its embedded algorithms process the substantial amount of layer by layer data gathered and then inform operators of the Quality Compliance status of each part in a build. We have been active in patent protecting our in-depth data analysis and quality algorithms to link our analysis to root cause metallurgy for determining the granular quantification of the part conformance to metallurgical requirements such as tensile strength. Concurrent with assessing the internal quality features of all parts in a build, PrintRite3D® deploys its CONTOUR™ module that measures each part’s adherence to the configuration specification of both internal channels and external form. OEM machine manufacturers as well as control system manufacturers may use the Sigma data stream to direct machine performance adjustments.
 
We have developed a tool that enables companies using Additive Manufacturing equipment for metal parts to move from prototyping on into production runs by assuring quality in a uniquely reliable and cost-effective fashion. Not only does PrintRite3D® enable a single AM machine to operate at high quality yields, by measuring the product of the manufacturing equipment rather than just the equipment settings, it also is a reliable method to assure and document uniform quality assurance of a single part’s specification being manufactured by factories utilizing a number of different AM machines.
 
We believe that the broad domain coverage of our PrintRite3D® patents and metallurgical know-how make the licensing of our product suite to be the best means by which Additive Manufacturing OEM equipment manufacturers can offer in-process-quality-monitoring that certifies and documents the quality of all parts that pass continuous inspection. PrintRite3D® provides 3D metal manufacturing equipment makers with a patent protected data configuration of information that the manufacturers may use to adjust controls of their equipment in response to real-time quality information by, for example, precisely adjusting laser power to sustain manufacturing to design and specification.
 
Our IPQA®-enabled PrintRite3D® software Apps appear well suited to meet the needs of metal AM at this critical juncture in its development. Our technology will allow metal AM to be used during manufacturing of safety-critical or performance-critical metal parts, such as used in aerospace, defense and biomedical. Currently, these applications are difficult because the part quality cannot be completely guaranteed using today’s conventional nondestructive inspection technologies and because using inspection after manufacture is difficult, costly and does not find all defects of concern. Therefore, we believe that PrintRite3D® could be an enabler for metal AM to realize its full potential. We have unique and patent protected offerings in this field. Furthermore, as a greater number of these AM applications could be cloud-based, the PrintRite3D® technology is fully compatible with highly networked, cloud- or web-based implementation – subject to the data and intellectual property restrictions which may be imposed by some companies for competitive reasons.

Our proprietary PrintRite3D® software Apps have been demonstrated and tested at many manufacturing sites around the world. We believe these demonstrations have served to validate the underlying technology of PrintRite3D® INSPECT™ and SENSORPAK™ software and hardware modules, respectively. In addition, we have developed relationships with experienced aerospace companies in North America that have assisted in the validation of the underlying technology for our PrintRite3D® software App known as CONTOUR™.
 
We are continuing to work on the separate development of our PrintRite3D® CONTOUR™ software App for metal-based AM under our Trial Evaluation Agreement with Honeywell Aerospace, which sets forth the parties’ intent to use Honeywell’s Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center as a beta test site for our PrintRite3D® CONTOUR™ software module. In further support of this effort, in 2015 Honeywell Aerospace installed its second PrintRite3D® system on one of its Concept Laser M2 machines at their Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center in Phoenix, Arizona.
 
We have expanded our market presence and associated installed base of PrintRite3D® systems through our Early Adopter Program (“EAP”) and our Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) Partner Program to include European companies in France, Germany and The Netherlands. These European partners’ installations are key to our long-term strategy to broaden its installed base through our EAP as well as gain market presence though embedded OEM offerings of our PrintRite3D® technology. Our PrintRite3D® product commercialization efforts reflect the strategic nature of our selective alliance partnerships.
 
We believe PrintRite3D® is uniquely positioned to grow into this market as its technology is platform independent and deployable with all currently known metal AM manufacturing units.
 
Business Model
 
Our commercialization strategy for PrintRite3D® products is:
 

● | Enter into early adopter license agreements with high potential future AM equipment manufacturers and complex part AM manufacturing service bureaus; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enter into OEM license agreements for PrintRite3D® to be integrated directly into the printers of major AM equipment manufacturers; 
● | Effective September 1, 2017, target and install units only at companies that are already manufacturing 3D metal parts and need to solve a quality yield problem; and 
● | Provide manufacturing engineering consulting services to third parties that have needs in developing quality assurance tactical methods for manufacturing. 

 
PrintRite3D® is designed to run on different machine platforms which allow us to maximize our product offering to the entire AM metal market. The target markets include OEMs both on the AM software side as well as OEM machine producers and end users.
 
We believe another much-needed area for AM metal parts manufacturing is in software Apps for reducing design and development cycle times, saving the end customer time and money. In support of that, in 2016, we entered into a Technology Development Agreement with 3DSIM, LLC of Park City, Utah, to pursue commercial metal AM software opportunities for rapid qualification and part certification. These software Apps could form the underpinnings and backbone of a conceptual software App known as THERMAL™. We expect in the future to attempt to develop and offer a PrintRite3D® suite of Apps which would be specifically developed to improve part designs and reduce traditional trial and error design approaches for features such as distortion control.

To summarize, we have formed an operating division focused on real-time, advanced quality assurance solutions for additive manufacturing thereby increasing the value of the AM part. Although in the past our revenues have been generated mainly through engineering consulting services we provided to third parties, we have generated revenues from December 2013 through the first quarter of 2019 through sales and licensing of our PrintRite3D® systems and software.
 
Technology and Competitive Advantage Demonstrated On-site
 
We currently have an AM 3D metal printing facility that employs state-of-the-art technology from the leading provider of metal AM systems, Electro-Optical Systems. While our current printing capacity is limited, we believe that a unique selling point or competitive advantage both for system sales of PrintRite3D® as well as local service bureau part sales is our demonstrable on-site PrintRite3D® technology. Our EOS M290 printer is outfitted with our latest PrintRite3D®-enabled technology allowing us to provide customers with the necessary documented objective evidence that a part is being built (and has been completed) in precise accord with the design specification, or Quality-as-a- Service (QaaS) data package, to ensure they can meet compliance with their design intent and ultimately end-user performance requirements for their highly-critical and demanding components. Our QaaS starts with our PrintRite3D® cloud-based SaaS model. Customers contract with us to generate and establish a digital quality record for AM built parts based on Design for Additive Manufacturing (“DFAM”) principles. Each DQR is cloud-based and allows for archiving and storage of quality data. The Reports both provide data to and have retrieval access from our big data ANALYTICS™ software App. The cloud-based system provides capability and resources for continuous quality monitoring and improvement. Concurrently, it will automatically compare build-data to industry benchmarking. Sigma has built in firewalls to shield company-specific data. Our QaaS service benefits our customers by providing independent quality assurance and increased process intelligence and access to our latest proprietary big data ANALYTICS™ software Apps for trending and additional manufacturing intelligence.
 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Sigma accomplished important internal product development milestones that led to the Company announcing on October 25, 2018 the rollout of a combination of new products at the Formnext additive manufacturing (AM) trade show in Frankfurt, Germany the week of November 12, 2018. Sigma believes that this combination of advanced new hardware and Sigma’s new PrintRite3D® Version 4.0 software completes the evolution of Sigma’s PrintRite3D® technology from its well-stressed and tested roots in research and development, into a compact and hardened commercial-industrial product that is deployable into demanding serial production settings.
 
Our competition is delivering In-Process-Quality-“Monitoring” tools that we believe generally deliver un-analyzed data to their customers to utilize as they see fit. Sigma is commercializing its PrintRite3D® hardware and software package that emerged from the third quarter of 2018 and is emphasizing to prospective customers Sigma’s dedication to delivering a product which provides In-Process-Quality-“Assurance” that gathers and analyzes in-process manufacturing data and delivers actionable conclusions that improve quality. We believe that such a product is made possible because of both: (1) PrintRite3D®’s ability to detect and notify users of process and machine discontinuities that require adjustments of the computers’ lasers in order to reduce AM machine-induced quality deficiencies, and (2) PrintRite3D®’s ability, in real-time in-process manufacturing runs, to detect a growing library of randomly recurring quality deficiencies, identify the signature traits of these deficiencies, and provide warnings and options to operators to adjust input and machine control parameters to mitigate those deficiencies early enough in their development to avoid rejection of the part.
 
On May 30, 2018, Sigma announced its successful demonstration of proof of concept of closed-loop feedback control. As a result of Sigma’s root cause analyses of various AM quality discrepancies, we have come to believe that the future of AM manufacturing machines is that the machines must and will be “self-driving”, i.e., controlled by a closed loop control system that adjusts and directs AM machine operating controls to maintain the optimum standard of melt pool qualities for the part designs and metals in question. We believe that the hardware and software package of our PrintRite3D® Version 4 is a significant advancement in the realization of this vison of the future.

Concurrent with the above-mentioned product development milestones that were realized in the third quarter of 2018, Sigma has been testing a new proof of concept sales program that was made possible and practicable by the attainment of such product development milestones. Beta test results have demonstrated that Sigma can now install and commence manufacturing test-runs on many AM machines in a 24-hour period and that a proof of concept and value analysis can be accomplished in a matter of weeks subject to how promptly customers and third-party laboratories commit resources and deliver their feedback on the results.
 
Business Purpose
 
Our AM 3D metal printing facility serves three business purposes. First, it is a demonstration facility that allows us a means of demonstrating our IPQA products for a prospective customer without them having to first install it on their equipment. Second, the printing facility allows us to stay current with the market’s needs by manufacturing high technology prototypes and then evaluating the challenges that each new configuration poses. Third, the in-house printing facility enables us to conduct research that deepens our own IPQA products.

Competition
 
We believe our technologies will be beneficial to several industries, including aerospace, defense, oil and gas, bio-medical, and power generation. However, developments by others may render our current and proposed technologies noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Additionally, our competitive position may be materially affected by our ability to develop or successfully commercialize certain technologies that we have identified for commercialization. Other general external factors may also impact the ability of our products to meet expectations or effectively compete, including pricing pressures.
 
We anticipate some of our principal competitors in the United States will include AM End Users, such as GE Aviation, Honeywell Aerospace, Rolls-Royce PLC, Pratt & Whitney; AM OEM equipment manufacturers, such as EOS, Concept Lasers, 3D Systems, Renishaw, Arcam and SLM; third party solution providers like Stratonics Inc., and Vibrant Corporation that specialize in designing and manufacturing quality control monitoring devices used in industrial applications. Some of these competitors may have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, and all have substantially more sales, marketing and financial and managerial resources. These OEM entities represent significant opportunity AND competition for us. Within the AM Metal industry, we are often hearing the term “Frenemies” used to describe relationships in which companies like Sigma are striving to sell OEM’s products that the OEMs would prefer to design in-house, even while exploring licensing from these outside ‘strivers.’
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our patents, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property law, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions with employees, partners, and others to protect the technology and other proprietary rights, information and know-how that comprise the core of our business. The chart below summarizes our issued patents. We are currently prosecuting twenty one foreign and U.S. patent applications related to our IPQA® technology and rapid qualification of additive manufacturing for metal parts. Eleven of these twenty one patent applications published between November 2015 and February 2019. There is no guarantee that the patent applications we have submitted will issue or that if issued, they will offer adequate protection under applicable law.

Government Regulation
 
Any contracts that we enter into with governmental agencies will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations are aimed at preventing the inadvertent disclosure of munitions related data or the export of technical knowledge to foreign countries. The work we do with governmental units may also be subject to laws respecting the confidentiality of any classified or national security information we receive during the course of our activities under any government contract.
 
Additionally, with respect to our work with government agencies, our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”), agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (“DCAA”). These agencies review a contractor’s performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and information systems.
