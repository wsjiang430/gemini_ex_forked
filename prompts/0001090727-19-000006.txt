Item 1. | Business

Overview
United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”) was founded in 1907 as a private messenger and delivery service in Seattle, Washington. Today, we are the world’s largest package delivery company, a leader in the U.S. less-than-truckload industry and a premier provider of global supply chain management solutions. We operate one of the largest airlines in the world, as well as the world’s largest fleet of alternative-powered vehicles. We deliver packages each business day for 1.5 million shipping customers to 9.1 million receivers ("consignees") in over 220 countries and territories. In 2018, we delivered an average of 20.7 million pieces per day, or a total of 5.2 billion packages. Total revenue in 2018 was $71.861 billion.
We serve the global market for logistics services, which includes transportation, distribution, contract logistics, ground freight, ocean freight, air freight, customs brokerage, insurance and financing. We have three reporting segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which together we refer to as our global small package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight, all of which are described below. 
Strategy
Our market strategy is to provide customers with advanced logistics solutions made possible by a broad portfolio of differentiated services and capabilities expertly assembled and integrated into our customers’ businesses. This approach, supported by our efficient and globally balanced multimodal network, enables us to deliver value to our customers and thereby build lasting partnerships with them.
Customers are able to leverage our broad portfolio of logistics capabilities comprised of: our balanced global presence in North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America; reliability; and industry-leading technologies and solutions expertise for competitive advantage in markets where they choose to compete.
We continue to invest in the expansion of the UPS business to serve our existing and prospective customers with a full range of advanced logistics products, services and capabilities across an ever-increasing geographical and industry footprint. Achieving our objectives has required new methods and innovative approaches to logistics services, including the acquisition and creation of platform-based businesses, specialized healthcare services such as Marken’s clinical trial capabilities, a full range of brokerage and transportation insurance services, retail offerings such as UPS My Choice and more.

We have a long history of operating with joint venture and partnership arrangements to provide flexibility as we build scale. We often reevaluate these arrangements to ensure they are optimally designed for our future aspirations. For example, in 2018, we acquired full ownership of our express services unit in India, signaling a new era of opportunity and operational design in a high-growth international market. We closely monitor global trade and economic, geopolitical, regulatory and environmental factors, as well as other areas of risk and change to ensure we quickly adjust to a fast-moving world.
We aim to be a disciplined and focused business that purposefully reinvests capital to achieve both long-term strategic benefits and favorable returns. In September 2018, we communicated our commitment to continuous transformation to modernize our business and operations through state-of-the art technology. We see transformation as an ongoing commitment to enhance quality and efficiency as we deliver innovative capabilities and services. Our strategic investments are primarily focused in areas we believe will drive growth and lasting profit potential:

• | Services and solutions for small and medium-sized businesses.


• | International growth markets.


• | Global Business to Consumer (“B2C”) and Business to Business (“B2B”) e-commerce.


• | Healthcare and life-sciences logistics.


• | Operational advancements and efficiencies through our technology-enabled network.

In 2018, we added nearly 400,000 pieces per hour of automated sort capacity globally, along with numerous new technologies to help control the network and ensure resources are in the right place at the right time. 
We have a long history of sound financial management, and our consolidated balance sheet showcases financial strength. Cash generation is a significant strength of UPS, giving us ample capacity to service our obligations and facilitate distributions to shareowners, reinvest in our business and pursue growth opportunities.
Reporting segments and products & services
Global Small Package
Our global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. We serve more than 220 countries and territories around the world along with domestic delivery service in more than 50 countries. We handle packages up to 108 inches in length that weigh up to 150 pounds and are up to 165 inches in combined length and girth, as well as palletized shipments weighing more than 150 pounds. All of our package services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies.
We handle all levels of service (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through one global integrated pickup and delivery network. We combine all packages within our network, unless dictated by specific service commitments. This enables one UPS driver to pick up customers’ shipments for any of our services at the same scheduled time each day. Compared to companies with single service network designs, our integrated network uniquely provides operational and capital efficiencies while being more environmentally friendly.
We offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages upon request. Customers can schedule pickups up to six days a week, based on their specific needs. Additionally, our wholly-owned and partnered global network offers roughly 150,000 entry points where customers can tender a package to us at a location or time convenient to them. This combined network includes UPS drivers who can accept packages provided to them, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations, The UPS Store locations, authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters, alliance locations and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Some of these locations offer a full array of services, including pickup, delivery and packing options, while others are drop-off locations only.
The continued growth of online and mobile shopping has increased our customers’ needs for efficient and reliable returns, resulting in our development of a robust selection of returns services that are available in more than 145 countries. The portfolio provides a range of cost-effective label options and a vast network of consumer drop points, as well as a selection of returns technologies that promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience. These options vary based on customer need and country and include solutions such as UPS Returns, as well as more-specialized services such as UPS Returns Exchange. Our technologies promote systems integration, client ease of use and visibility of inbound merchandise, which help reduce costs and improve efficiency of our merchants' reverse logistics processes. UPS Returns Manager is an excellent example of this value.

We operate one of the largest airlines in the world, with global operations centered at our Worldport hub in Louisville, Kentucky. Worldport sort capacity has expanded over the years due to volume growth and centralization efforts. Our European air hub is located in Cologne, Germany, and we maintain Asia Pacific air hubs in Shanghai, China; Shenzhen, China and Hong Kong. Our regional air hub in Canada is located in Hamilton, Ontario and our regional air hub for Latin America and the Caribbean is in Miami, Florida.
Our U.S. regional air hubs in Dallas, Texas; Ontario, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Rockford, Illinois support Worldport. This network design creates cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allows us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous U.S.
U.S. Domestic Package Reporting Segment
We are a leader in time-definite, money-back guaranteed, small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed ground and air package transportation services. 

• | Customers can select from same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives. UPS’s Air portfolio offers options enabling customers to specify a time-of-day guarantee for their delivery (e.g., by 8:00 A.M., 10:30 A.M., noon, end of day, etc.).


• | Customers can also leverage our extensive ground network to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service that serves every U.S. business and residential address. We deliver more ground packages in the U.S. than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of 14.5 million, most within one to three business days.


• | We also offer UPS SurePost, an economy residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. UPS SurePost is a contractual residential ground service that combines the consistency and reliability of the UPS Ground network with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service. We utilize our operational technology to identify multiple package delivery opportunities and redirect UPS SurePost packages for final delivery, improving time in transit, customer service and operational efficiency.

We continue to invest in our smart global logistics network. Within our facilities, we are expanding automated capacity, driving greater efficiencies and providing additional network flexibilities. We also continue to invest in our air network capacity through aircraft acquisitions. In 2018, we expanded Saturday operations and opened 22 new facilities, including regional facilities in the Atlanta, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Dallas areas.
International Package Reporting Segment
Our International Package reporting segment includes small package operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America and the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa ("ISMEA"). We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services. We offer more guaranteed time-definite express options (Express Plus, Express and Express Saver) than any other carrier.

• | In 2018, we continued expansion of our Express time-definite portfolios:


▪ | We expanded UPS WorldWide Express to 14 new countries around the globe.


▪ | UPS Express now reaches 137 countries with guaranteed mid-day delivery and 57 countries with guaranteed morning delivery with Express Plus.


▪ | Express Saver reaches 220 countries and territories with guaranteed end-of-day delivery.


▪ | We grew our Worldwide Express Freight Midday footprint by five times in 12 European countries by expanding this service to 39,000 new postal codes.


▪ | Worldwide Express Freight is available from 71 origin countries to 67 destination countries.


▪ | For international package shipments that do not require Express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. The service is available from more than 80 origin countries to more than 220 countries and territories.


▪ | For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada and between the U.S. and Mexico.

Europe, our largest region outside of the U.S., accounts for approximately half of international revenue and is one of the primary drivers of our growth. To accommodate the strong potential for growth in small package exports, we made a series of enhancements to both our ground and air networks that help reduce transit time by one to two days and will result in improved exporting opportunities for customers in Europe.

We are constantly striving to provide our customers with better service. In 2018, we provided our customers with greater flexibility by offering later pick-up times in nearly 52,000 postal codes across Europe, creating production and fulfillment benefits. We continue to make major European infrastructure investments, including a $146 million facility in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, the opening of a $150 million hub in London and the construction of a $100 million hub in Paris. These investments are part of ongoing efforts allowing customers using UPS Standard to reach more than 80 percent of Europe’s population within two business days. These recent expansions and enhancements are part of our commitment to invest nearly $2 billion in our European infrastructure.
Asia Pacific remains a strategic market due to growth rates in intra-Asia trade and the expanding Chinese economy. To capitalize on these opportunities, we are bringing faster time-in-transit to customers focused on intra-Asia trade and reducing transit time from Asia to the U.S. and Europe. Through added flight frequencies, we provide our customers the ability to ship next day to more places in the U.S. and Europe - guaranteed - than any other express carrier. We serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories through more than two dozen alliances with local delivery companies that supplement company-owned operations. Our joint venture with SF Express combines SF’s extensive Chinese network with UPS’s delivery capabilities in the U.S. and Europe to increase our market presence and help provide Chinese enterprises with greater global access.
In 2018, we extended cut-off times by four hours for export shipment pickups, lengthening production windows. We upsized four daily flights to our Shenzhen Intra-Asia hub and Hong Kong to our new Boeing 747-8s for greater capacity to support customers with import needs through gateways in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
High-growth markets are also a strategic imperative for UPS. A new direct flight from the U.S. to Dubai improves time in transit to key destinations in the ISMEA region for shippers throughout the U.S., Canada and the Americas. Markets like India in the ISMEA region provide new opportunities for growth. In 2018, we made additional investments in India to acquire full ownership of our express services unit, previously a joint venture. This follows the construction of a new facility in Hyderabad and an integrated logistics facility in Ahmedabad. These enhancements allow customers in ISMEA to reach markets in the U.S. and Europe within a 48-hour delivery window. In addition to these upgrades, we added Saturday delivery to seven countries in the region. The additional operating day gives our customers greater flexibility with their operations and scheduling. 
Supply Chain & Freight
Supply Chain & Freight consists of our forwarding, logistics, truckload brokerage, UPS Freight, UPS Capital and other businesses. Supply chain complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation, distribution and international trade and brokerage services, with complementary financial and information services. Outsourcing of non-core logistics activity is a strategy more companies are pursuing. With increased competition and growth opportunities in new markets, businesses require flexible and responsive supply chains to support their business strategies. We meet this demand by offering a broad array of supply chain services in more than 200 countries and territories.
Forwarding
We are one of the largest U.S. domestic air freight carriers and among the top international air freight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global air freight services. Additionally, as one of the world’s leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we provide ocean freight full-container load, less-than-container load and multimodal transportation services between most major ports around the world.
Truckload Brokerage
Coyote Logistics Midco, Inc. (“Coyote”), a U.S.-based third party logistics provider, was acquired in August 2015. We successfully integrated this large-scale truckload brokerage and transportation management services operation into our Supply Chain & Freight segment and have seen significant synergies in the areas of purchased transportation, backhaul utilization, technology systems and industry best practices. Coyote's access to our UPS fleet, combined with its broad carrier network, has created a customized capacity solution for all markets, customers and situations. Moreover, Coyote creates access to UPS services (such as air freight, customs brokerage and global freight forwarding) for its customer base.
Freightex, a U.K.- based freight brokerage firm, was acquired in January 2017. The acquisition of Freightex added a full-scale truckload brokerage and transportation management solution to UPS’s European portfolio, creating a single-source solution for shippers throughout Europe with freight ranging from parcel to full truckload. In 2018, Freightex was rebranded to Coyote Logistics to further leverage the centralized technology and business models with the market knowledge, talent and established customer and carrier bases already in Europe. The Coyote Logistics European division complements UPS’s North American truckload brokerage business, as many international shippers know and trust the Coyote truckload product.

Logistics
We provide value-added fulfillment and transportation management services to customers through our global network of company-owned and leased distribution centers and field stocking locations. We leverage a global network of more than 900 facilities in more than 100 countries around the globe to ensure products and parts are in the right place, at the right time.
Our distribution centers are strategically located near UPS air and ground transportation hubs for rapid delivery to consumer and business markets. In 2017, UPS began piloting a new integrated transportation fulfillment solution for small business e-commerce merchants, enabling them to rapidly expand and grow their offerings without additional capital investments. In 2018, we expanded our network to support new business growth by adding more than 1.6 million square feet of distribution capacity. 
Also in 2018, we rolled out new cloud-based transportation and warehouse management software platforms to drive higher operational efficiency and improve service to customers. The result has been better visibility, more rapid onboarding of customers and improved flexibility and response times.
Building on a 2017 pilot program, in 2018 we expanded a new integrated transportation-fulfillment solution for small business e-commerce merchants in the United States. The program enables small merchants to rapidly expand and grow their online offerings by providing connectivity to multiple marketplaces. 
UPS Post Sales, our service parts logistics solution, relies on a global network of central and field stocking sites to provide critical spare parts when and where customers need them. In 2018, we implemented new technology to support our Implantable Medical Device solution, which helps ensure surgical kits and devices arrive safely and on time at hospitals and surgery centers. This integrated solution was built in collaboration with WebOps, a medical device logistics and analytics technology provider, and Baxter Planning, an inventory planning and optimization solutions provider. We continue to expand UPS Access Point locations into our network, offering greater flexibility, more convenience and improved service for our customers. 
UPS Express Critical provides urgent, secure transportation for time-sensitive and high-value goods. It includes same-day, next-flight-out and door-to-door ground services, including specialized charter and hand-carry services for both lightweight and heavyweight shipments. 
UPS Freight
UPS Freight offers regional, inter-regional and long-haul less-than-truckload ("LTL") services in all 50 states, Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Mexico. UPS Freight provides reliable LTL service backed by a day-definite, on-time guarantee at no additional cost. UPS Freight also provides dedicated contract carriage truckload services to select clients. Additionally, user friendly shipping, visibility and billing technology offerings, including UPS WorldShip, Quantum View and UPS Billing Center, allow freight customers to create electronic bills of lading, monitor shipment progress and reconcile shipping charges.
Customs Brokerage
We are among the world’s largest customs brokers by both the number of shipments processed annually and by the number of dedicated brokerage employees worldwide. In addition to customs clearance services, we also provide product classification, trade management, duty drawback and consulting services through STTAS, a UPS company. STTAS was acquired in 2017 and is a major differentiator in our ability to become the global broker of choice in all markets important to our customers. In 2017, we also added to our portfolio UPS Zone Solutions, a leader in Foreign Trade Zone administration services in the United States.
UPS Capital
UPS Capital provides financial, insurance and payment services to leverage cash and help protect companies from risk in their supply chains. With services available in 22 countries and territories, UPS Capital and its affiliates support all aspects of the order-to-cash cycle, including financing inventory warehoused overseas, insuring shipments and providing payment solutions. The UPS Capital suite of insurance services, trade finance and payment solutions helps customers protect their assets and keeps their businesses running smoothly. UPS Capital also offers insured transportation of high value goods including loose gemstones, finished jewelry and wristwatches.

Our People
The strength of our company is our people, working together with a common purpose. We had more than 481,000 employees (excluding temporary seasonal employees) as of December 31, 2018, of which 399,000 are in the U.S. and 82,000 are located internationally. Our global workforce includes approximately 85,000 management employees (41% of whom are part-time) and 396,000 hourly employees (50% of whom are part-time). 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 283,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. These agreements expired on July 31, 2018. On October 5, 2018, the Teamsters declared that the tentative national master agreement for the U.S. Domestic Package business unit was considered ratified, and will be implemented as soon as five remaining local and supplemental agreements are negotiated and ratified. We remain in the process of negotiating and ratifying four of these local and supplemental agreements which, when ratified, will be retroactive to August 1, 2018. The UPS Freight business unit national master agreement was ratified on November 11, 2018. 
We have approximately 2,800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association ("IPA"), which becomes amendable on September 1, 2021. 
Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727. On February 8, 2019, the airline mechanics who are covered by this agreement voted to ratify a new contract which will become amendable November 1, 2023. In addition, approximately 3,100 of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”) that will expire on July 31, 2019.
Competition
UPS is a global leader in logistics. We offer a broad array of services in the package and freight delivery industry and compete with many different local, regional, national and international logistics providers. Our competitors include worldwide postal services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others, including startups that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. Through our supply chain service offerings, we compete with a number of providers in the supply chain, financial services and information technology industries.
Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths include:
Global Network.   We believe that our integrated global ground and air network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery service network. We also have extensive air freight, ocean freight, ground freight and logistics networks that provide additional capabilities in the global transportation and logistics market. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize our network efficiency and asset utilization on a daily basis. 
Global Presence.   We serve more than 220 countries and territories around the world. We have a significant presence in all of the world’s major economies.
Cutting-Edge Technology.    We are a global leader in developing technology that helps our customers enhance their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency.
Technology powers virtually every service we offer and every operation we perform. Customer need drives our technology offerings. We offer a variety of online service options that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own businesses not only to send, manage and track their shipments conveniently, but also to provide their customers with better information services. We provide the infrastructure for an internet presence that extends to tens of thousands of customers who have integrated UPS tools directly into their own websites.
Broad Portfolio of Services.    Our portfolio of services helps customers choose the delivery option that is most appropriate for their requirements. Increasingly, our customers benefit from business solutions that integrate many UPS services beyond package delivery. For example, our supply chain services – such as freight forwarding, truckload brokerage, customs brokerage, order fulfillment and returns management – help improve the efficiency of the supply chain management process.
Customer Relationships.    We focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. We serve 1.5 million shipping customers and more than 9.1 million delivery customers daily. Cross selling small package, supply chain and freight services across our customer base is an important growth mechanism for UPS.
6

Brand Equity.    We have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality service, reliability and service innovation. The distinctive appearance of our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.
Distinctive Culture.    We believe that the dedication of our employees comes in large part from our distinctive “employee-owner” concept. Our employee stock ownership tradition dates back to 1927, when our founders, who believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, first offered stock to employees. To encourage employee stock ownership, we maintain several stock-based compensation programs.
Financial Strength.    Our financial strength gives us the resources to achieve global scale; to invest in employee development, technology, transportation equipment and facilities; to pursue strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth; to service our obligations and to return value to our shareowners in the form of dividends, share repurchases and steady share growth.
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in connection with our package and non-package businesses in the countries in which we operate. Certain of these laws and regulations are summarized below.
Air Operations
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), have regulatory authority over United Parcel Service Co.’s (“UPS Airlines”) air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and FAA authority and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority.
The DOT’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as insurance requirements, discriminatory pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates, subject to the authority of the President of the United States, international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation regulations imposed by foreign governments in the countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. UPS Airlines has international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is dependent on DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.
The FAA’s authority primarily relates to safety aspects of air transportation, including aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In 1988, the FAA granted us an operating certificate, which remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable FAA regulations. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.
UPS aircraft maintenance programs and procedures, including aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals, are approved for all aircraft under FAA regulations. The future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition, age and the enactment of additional FAA regulatory requirements.
The TSA regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation in a manner consistent with the TSA mission statement to “protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.” UPS Airlines, and specified airport and off-airport locations, are regulated under TSA regulations applicable to the transportation of cargo in an air network. In addition, personnel, facilities and procedures involved in air cargo transportation must comply with TSA regulations.
UPS Airlines, along with a number of other domestic airlines, participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Our participation in the CRAF program allows the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) to requisition specified UPS Airlines aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency. The DOD is required to compensate us for the use of aircraft under the CRAF program. In addition, participation in CRAF entitles UPS Airlines to bid for other U.S. Government opportunities including small package and air freight.

Ground Operations
Our ground transportation of packages in the U.S. is subject to regulation by the DOT and its agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”) and the states’ jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service for drivers. We are subject to similar regulation in many non-U.S. jurisdictions.
The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the U.S. Postal Service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government, and created the Postal Rate Commission, an independent agency, to recommend postal rates. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 amended the 1970 Act to give the re-named Postal Regulatory Commission revised oversight authority over many aspects of the Postal Service, including postal rates, product offerings and service standards. We sometimes participate in the proceedings before the Postal Regulatory Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services.
Our ground operations are subject to compliance with various cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including regulation by the TSA.
Customs
We are subject to the customs laws in the countries in which we operate, regarding the import and export of shipments, including those related to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters. Our activities in the U.S., including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, the TSA, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission and the DOT. Our international operations are subject to similar regulatory structures in their respective jurisdictions. 
Environmental
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations across all of our business units. These laws and regulations cover a variety of processes, including, but not limited to: proper storage, handling and disposal of waste materials; appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; monitoring and maintaining the integrity of underground storage tanks; complying with laws regarding clean air, including those governing emissions; protecting against and appropriately responding to spills and releases and communicating the presence of reportable quantities of hazardous materials to local responders. We have established site- and activity-specific environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs to address our environmental responsibilities and remain compliant. In addition, we have created numerous programs which seek to minimize waste and prevent pollution within our operations.
Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Our aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. Our international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain countries in which we operate. 
Communications and Data Protection
Because of our extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in our aircraft and ground transportation operations, we are subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses our activities pertaining to satellite communications. There has recently been increased regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and in other countries. For example, the European Union (“E.U.”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law and increases the requirements related to personal data, including individual notice and opt-out preferences and public disclosure of significant data breaches. Additionally, violations of the GDPR can result in significant fines. Other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws, and are considering data localization laws that would govern the use of data outside of their respective jurisdictions.
