The Origins of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM
 
The Company’s operations began in 1976 when James F. McCann, the Company’s founder and current Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, acquired a single retail florist in New York City, which he subsequently expanded to a 14-store chain. Thereafter, the Company modified its business strategy to take advantage of the rapid emergence of toll-free calling. The Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone number 1-800-FLOWERS, adopted it as its corporate identity and began to aggressively build a national brand around it. The Company believes it was one of the first companies to embrace this new way of conducting business.
 
In order to support the growth of its toll-free business and to provide superior customer service, the Company developed an operating infrastructure that incorporated the best available technologies. Over time, the Company implemented a sophisticated transaction processing system that facilitated rapid order entry and fulfillment, while adding customer service capabilities to handle increasing call volume.
 
To enable the Company to deliver products reliably nationwide, on a same-day or next-day basis, and to market pre-selected, high-quality floral products, the Company created BloomNet, a nationwide network including independent local florists selected for their high-quality products, superior customer service and order fulfillment and delivery capabilities.
 
1-800-FLOWERS.COM offers a broad range of truly original gifts through a multi-channel strategy, making it easy for millions of customers to deliver smiles for every occasion. Complementing its retail, telephonic and e-commerce channels, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM is a pacesetter in social and mobile platforms, pioneering award-winning marketing programs and applications. As a result, the Company has developed relationships with customers who purchase products for both a wide range of celebratory gifting occasions as well as for everyday personal use. In addition to offering a broad selection of unique products that a customer could expect to find in a high-end florist and gift shop, including a wide assortment of cut flowers and plants, candy, balloons, plush toys, giftware, gourmet gift baskets, and fruit bouquet arrangements, the Company has also significantly expanded its presence in the gourmet food and gift baskets category. Through a combination of organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, the Company has leveraged its leadership position in the floral gifting category to create a leading position in the growing gourmet foods & gift baskets category.

The Company’s Strategy
 
1-800-FLOWERS.COM’s objective is to be the leading authority on thoughtful gifting, to serve an expanding range of our customers’ celebratory needs, thereby helping our customers express themselves and connect with the important people in their lives. The Company will continue to build on the trusted relationships with our customers by providing them with ease of access, tasteful and appropriate gifts, and superior service.
 
The Company believes that 1-800-FLOWERS.COM is one of the most recognized brands in the floral and gift industry. The strength of its brand has enabled the Company to extend its product offerings beyond the floral category into complementary products, which include gourmet popcorn, cookies and related baked and snack food products, premium chocolate and confections, wine gifts, gourmet gift baskets, fruit bouquet arrangements, and gift-quality fruit baskets, as well as steaks, chops and prepared meals. This extension of gift offerings helps our customers with all of their celebratory occasions, and will enable the Company to increase the number of purchases and the average order value by existing customers who have come to trust the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand, as well as continue to attract new customers. The Company’s consolidated customer database and multi-brand website is designed to expose all of our brands to our customers, further enhancing the Company’s position as a leading, one-stop destination for all of our customers’ gifting and celebratory needs.
 
The Company believes its brands are characterized by:
 
● | Convenience. The Company’s product offerings can be purchased through the Company’s website via desktop or mobile devices, as well as through Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, Google Assistant, Apple Business Chat, Samsung Chatbot, or Google Rich Business Messaging, to help guide customers to the perfect gift across our brands. For those customers who prefer a personal gift advisor to assist them, the Company’s toll-free telephone numbers are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality. High-quality products are critical to the Company’s continued brand strength and are integral to the brand loyalty that it has built over the years. The Company offers its customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all of its products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delivery Capability. The Company has developed a market-proven fulfillment infrastructure that allows delivery on a same-day, next-day and any-day basis throughout the world. Key to the Company’s fulfillment capability is an innovative “hybrid” model which combines BloomNet (comprised of independent florists operating retail flower shops, Company-owned stores, and franchised stores), with its manufacturing and distribution centers located across the country, and third-party vendors who ship directly to the Company’s customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Selection. Over the course of a year, the Company offers more than 10,200 varieties of fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit bouquets and plants, and more than 11,300 SKUs of gifts, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies and chocolates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer Service. The Company strives to ensure that customer service, whether online, wireless, via the telephone, or in one of its retail stores is of the highest caliber. The Company operates customer service centers in Ohio and Oregon, while also utilizing a network of home agents and outsourcers to provide helpful assistance on everything from advice on product selection to the monitoring of the fulfillment and delivery process.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As part of the Company’s continuing effort to serve the thoughtful gifting needs of its customers, and leverage its business platform, the Company continues to execute its vision to build a “Celebratory Ecosystem”, including a collection of premium gifting brands, and an increasing suite of products and services designed to help our customers deliver smiles to the important people in their lives.
 
The platform that the Company has built allows it to expand rapidly into new product categories using a “marketplace” concept, providing its customers with a wider selection of solutions to help them express, connect and celebrate for all occasions and recipients – including themselves. The Company intends to accomplish this through organic development, and where appropriate, through acquisition of complementary businesses. A summary of the Company’s more significant brands and/or businesses follows:

Although the Company’s family of brands maintain their own sense of identity, the Company has taken a holistic approach towards examining and operating the entire enterprise.

The Company believes that these initiatives and its continued focus on the following core values will drive long-term profitable growth:
 

● | Know and Take Care of Our Customers - by providing the right products and the best services with consistent, excellent quality and value to help them express themselves and deliver smiles. Harry & David was named to the Internet Retailers 2019 “The Hot 100” list. In 2017, 1-800-Flowers.com was awarded the Gold Stevie “e-Commerce Customer Service” Award, recognizing the Company’s innovative use of online technologies and social media to service the needs of customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain and Enhance our Financial Strength and Flexibility - by seeking ways to reduce our operating costs while strengthening our balance sheet and adding flexibility to our capital structure. During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the purchase of Harry & David, and in order to finance the acquisition, entered into a credit agreement consisting of a term loan and a new revolving credit facility, assuring capital availability and future flexibility. In December 2016, the Company amended and restated the previous credit agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the $115.0 million outstanding term loan and the revolving credit facility by approximately two years to December 23, 2021. In May 2017, the Company sold its underperforming Fannie May business, generating more than $100 million in cash. In May 2019, the Company amended and restated the previous credit agreement to, among other things, increase the amount of the outstanding term loan from approximately $97 million to $100 million, extend the maturity date of the outstanding Term Loan and the revolving credit facility (“Revolver”) by approximately 29 months to May 31, 2024, and decrease the applicable interest rate margins for LIBOR and base rate loans by 25 basis points.

● | Continue to Innovate and Invest for the Future - by investing in technology and new growth opportunities. 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. received the Gold award in the “Mobile Payments and Commerce” category at the Mobile Marketing Association 2018 Global Smarties Awards. The Company also continues to build on its reputation as an “innovator” and an “early adopter” of new technologies that can enhance customer engagement.

The Company’s Products and Service Offerings
 
The Company offers a wide range of products including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candy, wine, and gift-quality fruit. In order to maximize sales opportunities, products are not exclusive to certain brands, and may be sold across business categories. The Company’s differentiated and value-added product offerings create the opportunity to have a relationship with customers who purchase items not only for gift-giving occasions but also for everyday consumption. The Company’s merchandising team works closely with manufacturers and suppliers to select and design its floral, gourmet foods and gift baskets, as well as other gift-related products that accommodate our customers' needs to celebrate a special occasion or convey a sentiment. As part of this continuing effort, the Company intends to continue to develop differentiated products and signature collections that customers have embraced and come to expect.
 
During each of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 1% of consolidated net revenue came from international sources. 
 
Flowers and Plants. The Company offers fresh-cut flowers and floral and fruit arrangements for all occasions and holidays, available for same-day delivery. The Company provides its customers with a choice of florist designed products, including traditional floral and gift offerings, and the Company’s line of fruit arrangements, under the Fruit Bouquets brand, and flowers delivered fresh from the farm. The Company also offers a wide variety of popular plants to brighten the home and/or office, and accent gardens and landscapes.
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets. Harry & David is a vertically integrated, multi-channel specialty retailer and producer of branded premium gift-quality fruit, food products and gifts marketed under the Harry & David, Wolferman’s, Cushman’s and Moose Munch brands. The Company also licenses the Stock Yards name through which it sells premium meats. The Company manufactures premium cookies and baked gift items under the Cheryl’s and Mrs. Beasley’s brands, which are delivered in beautiful and innovative gift boxes and containers, providing customers with a variety of assortments from which to choose. The Popcorn Factory brand pops premium popcorn and specialty snack products. The 1-800-Baskets.com brand features a collection of gourmet gift baskets and related products confected by DesignPac, as well as through third parties. Simply Chocolate, launched in November 2017, offers artisan chocolates and confections. Many of the Company’s gourmet products are packaged in seasonal, occasion specific or decorative tins, fitting the “giftable” requirement of individual customers, while also adding the capability to customize the tins with corporate logos and other personalized features for the Company’s corporate customers’ gifting needs.

BloomNet Products and Services. The Company’s BloomNet business provides its members with products and services, including: (i) clearinghouse services, consisting of the settlement of orders between sending florists (including the 1-800-Flowers.com brand) and receiving florists, (ii) advertising, in the form of member directories, including the industry’s first on-line directory, (iii) access services, by which BloomNet florists are able to send and receive orders and communicate between members, using Bloomlink®, the Company’s proprietary Internet-based system, (iv) other services including web hosting, marketing services and point of sale, and (v) wholesale products, which consist of branded and non-branded floral supplies, enabling member florists to reduce their costs through 1-800-Flowers purchasing leverage, while also ensuring that member florists will be able to fulfill 1-800-Flowers.com brand orders based on recipe specifications. While maintaining industry-high quality standards for its 1-800-Flowers.com brand customers, the Company offers florists a compelling value proposition, offering products and services that its florists need to grow their business and to enhance profitability.
 
Marketing and Promotion
 
The Company’s marketing and promotional strategy is designed to strengthen the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brands, increase customer acquisition, build customer loyalty, and encourage repeat purchases. The Company’s goal is to create a celebratory ecosystem that makes its brands synonymous with thoughtful gifting and to help our customers “send smiles” every day. To do this, the Company intends to invest in its brands and acquire new customers through the use of selective on and off-line media, direct marketing, public relations and strategic relationships, while cost-effectively capitalizing on the Company’s large and loyal customer base.
 
The Company’s strong appeal and brand recognition provide it with significant marketing opportunities. For example, the Company was featured in an episode of the CBS TV hit reality show Undercover Boss, providing a great opportunity for all of its brands to receive broad national exposure in front of an estimated 15 million viewers, while also being included in the Walk of Shame movie. Our “Summer of a Million Smiles” charitable efforts deliver smiles to local charities, communities and service initiatives across the country. We also introduced our enterprise-wide “Gifts That Give Back” collection in support of our Smiles Farms philanthropic initiative which is focused on creating meaningful employment opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities – a program that we are proud to have founded. And, in what can be considered one of the best compliments a brand can receive, 1-800-Flowers.com’s place in America’s cultural fabric was confirmed when the brand was featured in a great spoof on Mother’s Day family relations during a Saturday Night Live skit.
 
Enhance its Customer Relationships. The Company intends to deepen its relationship with its customers and be their trusted resource to fulfill their need for quality, tasteful gifts. It plans to improve customer purchase frequency via product exposure through its multi-brand portal, by providing value-added loyalty programs such as Celebrations Reminders and Passport and continually investing and innovating how and where it engages with its customers. Examples of these efforts include the Company’s active social media presence, and use of new and innovative platforms to reach customers, whether it be Facebook’s Messenger, Amazon’s Alexa voice-enabled platform, Google Assistant, Apple Business Chat, Samsung Chatbot or Google Rich Business Management. The Company also launched Smart Gift, a digital gifting application that enables customers to send a gift even when they don’t have their recipient’s address. The Company strives to improve our customer’s experience, and recently launched a digital self-service portal, allowing customers to track their orders, make modifications to delivery dates, addresses, and even their gift message, further enhancing the Company’s already historically high customer satisfaction metrics. In addition, through customer panel research, the Company has created a number of signature products designed to increase everyday purchases, including the “a DOG-able™” and “Fabulous Feline™” collections, the Unicorn line – based on the success of our Enchanting Unicorn floral arrangement – including Magical Unicorn Truffle Cake Pops and the Dazzling Unicorn, succulents collection, Fruit Bouquet Cookie Flower and Emoji arrangements, Cookie Cards, Fruit Bouquets, as well as Harry & David’s signature Comice pears, Moose Munch popcorn, and Gourmet line, all of which build upon the Company’s efforts to offer unique products, a strategy which stems back to the Company’s earliest signature collections, such as the still popular “Birthday Cake” and “Happy Hour” collections.
 
Strategic Online and Digital Relationships. The Company promotes its products through strategic relationships with leading Internet portals, search engines, and mobile and online social networks. The Company continues to leverage its experience and expertise in digital marketing where it is increasingly utilizing machine-learning in our search, display, video and other marketing programs.
 
Affiliate and Co-Marketing Promotions. In addition to securing alliances with frequently visited websites, the Company has developed an affiliate network that includes thousands of websites operated by third parties. Affiliate participation may be terminated by them or by the Company at any time. These websites earn commissions on purchases made by customers referred from their sites to the Company’s website. In order to expand the reach of its marketing programs and stretch its marketing dollars, the Company has established a number of co-marketing relationships and promotions to advertise its products.
 
E-mails. The Company is able to capitalize on its customer database by utilizing cost-effective, targeted e-mails to notify customers of product promotions, remind them of upcoming gifting occasions and convey other marketing messages, while maintaining user privacy.
 
 6


Direct Mail and Catalogs. The Company uses its direct mail promotions and catalogs to increase the number of new customers and to increase purchase frequency of its existing customers. Through the use of catalogs, the Company can utilize its extensive customer database to effectively cross-promote its products. In addition to providing a direct sale mechanism, these catalogs drive on-line sales and will attract additional customers to the Company’s websites.
Off-line Media. The Company utilizes off-line media, including television, radio and print to market its brands and products. Off-line media allows the Company to reach a large number of customers and to target particular market segments.
The Company’s Websites
 
The Company offers its products primarily through its multi-branded 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (www.1800flowers.com) website. The Company’s customers can access its family of brands through “tabs” on this Universal Resource Locators (“URL”), as well as through the URL of any of our family of brands, all with multi-brand functionality. Customers can come directly to the Company’s websites or be linked by one of the Company’s portal providers, search engine, affiliate or social media relationships. A majority of the Company’s online revenues are derived from traffic coming directly to one of the Company’s URLs.
 
The Company’s websites allow customers to easily browse and purchase its products, promote brand loyalty and encourage repeat purchases by providing an inviting customer experience. The Company’s websites offer customers detailed product information, complete with photographs, personalized shopping services, including search and order tracking, contests, gift-giving suggestions and reminder programs, party tips and planning, and information about special events and offers. The Company has designed its desktop and mobile websites to be fast, secure and easy to use and allows customers to order products with minimal effort.
 
Technology Infrastructure
 
The Company believes it has been and continues to be a leader in implementing new technologies to give its customers the best possible shopping experience, whether online or over the telephone. Through the use of customized software applications, the Company is able to retrieve, sort and analyze customer information to enable it to better serve its customers and target its product offerings. The Company’s online and telephonic orders are fed directly from the Company’s secure websites, or with the assistance of a gift advisor, into a transaction processing system which captures the required customer and recipient information. The system then routes the order to the appropriate Company distribution center or, for florist fulfilled or drop-shipped items, selects a florist or vendor to fulfill the customer's order and electronically transmits the necessary information using BloomLink, the Company’s proprietary Internet-based system, assuring timely delivery. In addition, the Company’s gift advisors have electronic access to this system, enabling them to assist in order fulfillment and subsequently track other customer and/or order information. We also launched an interactive, telephonic virtual assistant, integrating artificial intelligence and human understanding to reduce customer wait times and improve the customer experience.
 
The Company’s technology infrastructure, primarily consisting of the Company’s websites, transaction processing, manufacturing and warehouse management, customer databases and telecommunications systems, is built and maintained for reliability, security, scalability and flexibility. To minimize the risk of service interruptions from unexpected component or telecommunications failure, maintenance and upgrades, the Company has built back-up and system redundancies into those components of its systems that have been identified as critical.
 
Fulfillment and Manufacturing Operations
 
The Company’s customers primarily place their orders either online or over the telephone. The Company’s development of a hybrid fulfillment system, which enables the Company to offer same-day, next-day and any-day delivery, combines the use of BloomNet (comprised of independent florists operating retail flower shops and franchise florist shops), with the Company-owned distribution centers and vendors who ship directly to the Company’s customers. While providing a significant competitive advantage in terms of delivery options, the Company’s fulfillment system also has the added benefit of reducing the Company’s capital investments in inventory and infrastructure. All of the Company’s products are backed by a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and the Company’s business is not dependent on any single third-party supplier.
 
To ensure reliable and efficient communication of online and telephonic orders to its BloomNet members and third party gift vendors, the Company developed BloomLink, a proprietary and secure Internet-based system which is available to all BloomNet members and third-party gift vendors. The Company also has the ability to arrange for international delivery of floral products through third-party relationships.

Fulfillment and manufacturing of products is as follows:
 
Flowers and Plants. A majority of the Company’s floral orders are fulfilled by one of the Company’s BloomNet members, allowing the Company to deliver its floral and fruit bouquet products on a same-day or next-day basis to ensure freshness and to meet its customers’ need for immediate gifting. In addition, the Company is better positioned to ensure consistent product quality and presentation and offer a greater variety of arrangements, which creates a better experience for its customers and gift recipients. The Company selects retail florists for BloomNet based upon the florist's design staff, facilities, quality of floral processing, and delivery capabilities and allocates orders to members within a geographical area based on historical performance of the florist in fulfilling orders, and the number of BloomNet florists currently serving the area. The Company regularly monitors BloomNet florists’ performance and adherence to the Company’s quality standards to ensure proper fulfillment.
 
In addition to its florist designed product, the Company also offers its customers an alternative through its direct ship products fresh from the farm.
 
Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets. The Company offers a wide array of premium branded signature baked products, confections, gift baskets, gourmet popcorn, giftable fruit towers and baskets through its Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets’ brands. The Company’s Cheryl’s cookies and baked gifts are manufactured in its baking facility in Westerville, Ohio, while the Popcorn Factory and Moose Munch premium snack products are popped in Medford, Oregon and Lake Forest, Illinois. Harry & David products are grown and manufactured primarily from its facilities in Medford, Oregon. Gift basket confection and fulfillment for both wholesale and 1-800-Baskets.com is handled by DesignPac, located in Melrose Park, Illinois. Our products are distributed from a combination of Company owned and leased distribution facilities, across the country, which are shared by our brands in order to reduce both transit time to customer, and overall logistics costs. As of June 30, 2019, the Company operates 7 Cheryl’s and 39 Harry & David retail stores.
Seasonality
 
The Company’s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business, and its continued expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company’s second fiscal quarter, generates nearly 50% of the Company’s annual revenues, and all of its earnings. Additionally, due to the number of major floral gifting occasions, including Mother's Day, Valentine’s Day, Easter and Administrative Professionals Week, revenues also rise during the Company’s fiscal third and fourth quarters in comparison to its fiscal first quarter. In fiscal 2017, Easter was on April 16th, which resulted in the shift of most Easter-related revenue and EBITDA into the Company’s fourth quarter. In fiscal 2018, Easter was on April 1st, which resulted in the shift of Easter-related revenue and EBITDA into the Company’s third quarter. In fiscal 2019, Easter was on April 21st, which resulted in the shift of most Easter-related e-commerce and retail revenue and associated EBITDA, from the Company’s third quarter, back to its fourth quarter. In fiscal 2020, Easter falls on April 12th, which is not expected to result in a material quarterly shift of revenues compared to fiscal 2019.
 
In preparation for the Company’s second quarter holiday season, the Company significantly increases its inventories, and therefore, corresponding cash requirements, which traditionally have been financed by cash flows from operations and bank lines of credit, which peak in November. The Company has historically repaid all revolving bank lines of credit with cash generated from operations, prior to the end of the Company’s fiscal second quarter.

Competition
 
The growing popularity and convenience of e-commerce shopping has continued to give rise to established businesses on the Internet. In addition to selling their products over the Internet, many of these retailers sell their products through a combination of channels by maintaining a website, a toll-free phone number and physical locations. Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding variety of products and some are attracting an increasing number of customers. Certain mass merchants have expanded their offerings to include competing products and may continue to do so in the future. These businesses, as well as other potential competitors, may be able to:
 
● undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services;
 ● adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and
 ● make more attractive offers to potential employees, distributors and retailers.
 
In addition, the Company faces intense competition in each of its individual product categories. In the floral industry, there are various providers of floral products, none of which is dominant in the industry. The Company’s competitors include:
 
● retail floral shops, some of which maintain toll-free telephone numbers and websites;
 ● online floral retailers, as well as retailers offering substitute gift products;
 ● catalog companies that offer floral products;
 ● floral telemarketers and wire services; and
 ● supermarkets, mass merchants and specialty retailers with floral departments.
 
Similarly, the plant, gift basket and gourmet foods categories are highly competitive. Each of these categories encompasses a wide range of products, is highly fragmented and is served by a large number of companies, none of which is dominant. Products in these categories may be purchased from a number of outlets, including mass merchants, telemarketers, retail specialty shops, online retailers and mail-order catalogs.
 
The Company believes the strength of its brands, product selection, customer relationships, technology infrastructure and fulfillment capabilities position it to compete effectively against its current and potential competitors in each of its product categories. However, increased competition could result in:
 
● price reductions, decreased revenues and lower profit margins;
 ● loss of market share; and
 ● increased marketing expenditures.
 
These and other competitive factors may adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations.
 
Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties
 
The Internet continues to evolve and there are laws and regulations directly applicable to e-commerce. Legislatures are also considering an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet, including laws and regulations addressing:
 
● user privacy;
 ● pricing;
 ● content;
 ● connectivity;
 ● intellectual property;
 ● distribution;
 ● taxation and tariffs;
 ● liabilities;
 ● antitrust; and
 ● characteristics and quality of products and services.
 
Further, the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may impair the growth of the Internet or commercial online services. This could decrease the demand for the Company’s services and increase its cost of doing business. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws regarding issues like property ownership, taxes, libel and personal privacy is uncertain. Any new legislation or regulation that has an adverse impact on the Internet or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

States or foreign countries might attempt to regulate the Company’s business or levy additional sales or other taxes relating to its activities. Because the Company’s products and services are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions may claim that the Company is required to do business as a foreign corporation in one or more of those jurisdictions. Failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where the Company is required to do so could subject it to taxes and penalties. States or foreign governments may charge the Company with violations of local laws.
 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
The Company regards its service marks, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and similar intellectual property as critical to its success. The Company has applied for or received trademark and/or service mark registration for, among others, “1-800-FLOWERS.COM”, “1-800-FLOWERS”, “1-800-Baskets.com”, "FruitBouquets.com", "BloomNet", “GreatFood.com”, “The Popcorn Factory”, “Cheryl’s Cookies”, “Mrs. Beasley’s”, “Celebrations Passport”, “Flowerama”, “DesignPac”, “Napco”, “Harry & David”, “Wolferman’s", “Moose Munch”, Cushman’s”, “Goodsey”, “Simply Chocolate”, and “Personalization Universe”. The Company also has rights to numerous domain names, including: www.1800flowers.com, www.800flowers.com, www.1800baskets.com, www.flowers.com, www.personalizationuniverse.com, www.goodsey.com, www.greatfood.com, www.stockyards.com, www.cheryls.com, www.celebrations.com, www.flowerama.com, www.designpac.com, www.simplychocolate.com, www.mybloomnet.net, www.napcoimports.com, www.thepopcornfactory.com, www.harryanddavid.com and www.wolfermans.com. In addition, the Company owns a number of international trademarks and/or service marks. The Company has also developed transaction processing and operating systems as well as marketing data, and customer and recipient information databases.
 
The Company relies on trademark, unfair competition and copyright law, trade secret protection and contracts such as confidentiality and license agreements with its employees, customers, vendors and others to protect its proprietary rights. Despite the Company’s precautions, it may be possible for competitors to obtain and/or use the Company’s proprietary information without authorization or to develop technologies similar to the Company’s and independently create a similarly functioning infrastructure. Furthermore, the protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The Company’s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate.
 
Third parties have in the past infringed or misappropriated the Company’s intellectual property or similar proprietary rights. The Company believes infringements and misappropriations will continue to occur in the future. The Company intends to police against infringement and misappropriation. However, the Company cannot guarantee it will be able to enforce its rights and enjoin the alleged infringers from their use of confusingly similar trademarks, service marks, telephone numbers and domain names.
 
In addition, third parties may assert infringement claims against the Company. The Company cannot be certain that its technologies or its products and services do not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights or other proprietary rights held by third parties. The Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to its intellectual property and the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of its business. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management resources away from running the Company’s business.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had a total of 4,095 full and part-time employees. During peak periods, the Company substantially increases the number of customer service, manufacturing and retail and fulfillment personnel. The Company’s personnel are not represented under collective bargaining agreements and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.
