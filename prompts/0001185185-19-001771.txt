ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
AngioSoma is a wellness company dedicated to bringing innovative, effective and high-quality supplement products to the medical, wellness and adult-use markets through our marketing subsidiary, SomaCeuticalsTM. SomaCeuticals has acquired a diversified supply of supplements, strong clinical, scientific and operating capabilities and leading product research and development infrastructure in order to create trusted products and brands in an expanding global market.
 
We have abandoned our pursuit of FDA clearance and marketing of any drugs or products, including LiprostinTM, the patented pharmaceutical for a controlled drug delivery system. When rights to the drug were acquired it was represented that the initial clinical trials had been successfully completed and the single remaining trial was eligible to go forward. Research disclosed the representations are untrue. Therefore, further efforts to seek clearance and market the product ceased.
