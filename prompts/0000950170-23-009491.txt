Overview
 
Company Summary
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of our novel, potentially first-in-class product candidate, neffy® (previously referred to as ARS-1) for the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. neffy is a proprietary composition of epinephrine with an innovative absorption enhancer called Intravail®, which allows neffy to provide injection-like absorption of epinephrine at a low dose, in a small, easy-to-carry, easy-to-use, rapidly administered and reliable nasal spray.
 Type I severe allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine injection, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine injection devices have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. Delay in treatment can allow the allergic reaction to progress in severity leading to symptoms that seriously impact patient quality of life, to potential need for emergency services and/or hospitalizations, and to life-threatening symptoms or events.
 There are approximately 25 to 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I allergic reactions. Of this group, approximately 16 million people have been diagnosed and experienced severe Type I allergic reactions that may lead to anaphylaxis, but only 3.3 million currently have an active epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed autoinjector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency. In aggregate, we estimate that 90% of patients prescribed an epinephrine device are not achieving an optimal treatment outcome today.
 We believe neffy’s “no needle, no injection” delivery that eliminates needle-related apprehension and injury concerns, with its small pocket size, ease of use, and high reliability would, if approved, increase prescriptions for epinephrine and make it more likely for patients and caregivers to administer epinephrine sooner, achieve more rapid symptom relief and prevent the allergic reaction from progressing to a level of severity that could lead to hospitalization or even death. Data from our studies of neffy in more than 600 subjects demonstrated nasally delivered epinephrine reached blood levels comparable to those of already approved epinephrine injectable products.
 Our NDA was accepted for review by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 with an anticipated mid-2023 PDUFA target action date, and if our NDA is approved, we believe neffy will be the first “no needle, no injection” marketed epinephrine product for the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions. However, the timing for regulatory approvals is outside of our control and may be delayed and is uncertain.


Epinephrine and Allergic Reactions Background
 Type I allergic reactions are potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and need to be treated immediately to relieve symptoms and prevent further progression. Initial symptoms significantly impact patient quality of life and include difficulty breathing, bronchospasms, hypotension, presyncope, itching, hives, swelling of eyes and lips, and abdominal pain and vomiting. If not treated immediately, more severe reactions known as anaphylaxis that involve constriction of the airways, swelling of the throat, rapid heart rate, severe hypotension and other respiratory and cardiac symptoms can develop and potentially present a medical and life-threatening emergency. Immediate administration of epinephrine is currently the only first-line treatment for Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The only out-of-hospital delivery option today is an intra-muscular injectable product, typically offered as prefilled syringes or auto-injector devices, such as EpiPen®, which is marketed by Viatris Inc., and generic versions of EpiPen, marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These intra-muscular auto-injection devices have several limitations that result in under-utilization by patients and may lead to serious complications and hospitalizations.
 These limitations include:
 
 | lack ease of portability with only 50% of patients filling prescriptions carrying the device;


 | reluctance to use the device with approximately 25% to 50% of patients carrying the device refusing to administer;


 | apprehension stemming from the use of a needle that leads to approximately 40% to 60% of patients delaying administration by up to 18 minutes even if they are carrying the device;


 | a high rate of dosing errors, with meta-analyses reporting up to 35% of patients still failing to dose correctly even after training; and


 | safety concerns including lacerations, caregiver self-injection and frequent potentially cardiotoxic blood vessel injections, which occurred in approximately 14% of EpiPen subjects in our patient self-administration studies.

 As a result, many of the approximately 25 to 40 million patients at risk of severe Type I allergic reactions do not receive or fill prescriptions for intra-muscular injectables. Of 3.3 million patients that do fill their prescriptions, approximately half do not carry the intra-muscular injectable products with them on a regular basis, while many of the other half delay or hesitate treatment during a severe Type I allergic reaction. This may contribute to treatment postponement, prolonging troublesome symptoms, reducing quality of life and increasing the risk of complications or even death. In addition to the 3.3 million patients who currently fill their prescriptions for an epinephrine injectable device, we estimate that approximately 2.5 million patients received a prescription in the last 3 years, but either did not fill or renew it. We believe the advantages of neffy will be attractive to this group and lead to an increase in the number of patients filling their prescription as further described below. These patients are additive to the 3.3 million patients that do fill a prescription per year.
 Notwithstanding their widespread lack of use, we estimate that net sales of intra-muscular injectable products approved for outpatient use in the United States was approximately $1 billion in 2021 among the approximately 3.3 million patients who filled a prescription.


 Our Approach
 

neffyTM is an investigational drug currently in clinical trials for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (type I) including anaphylaxis. neffyTM is not approved by the FDA, EMA or other health authorities.
 

neffy is designed to address the shortcomings of intra-muscular injectable devices. neffy is a convenient “no needle, no injection,” solution designed to be easier to carry, more reliable and easier to administer, without the aversion, safety concerns and fear and pain of needles associated with intra-muscular injectables. Based on the factors set forth below, we believe that neffy can transform the paradigm of epinephrine delivery from cumbersome, unreliable, intra-muscular injectable devices to an intranasal delivery method that makes patients more likely to administer epinephrine sooner, thus achieving more rapid symptom relief and preventing symptoms from becoming serious or life-threatening.
 
 | Comparable PK and PD to injection products. In our clinical trials, we observed that neffy has comparable pharmacokinetics (“PK”) and pharmacodynamics (“PD”) compared to marketed epinephrine injectables.


 | Needle-free, easy-to-use, pocket-sized and highly reliable nasal spray. neffy is easier to carry than approved intra-muscular injectables because it is pocket-sized, increasing the likelihood that the device is available for use in an emergency. Our registrational self-administration study (EPI-17) with 2.0 mg neffy demonstrated that adult patients had zero critical dosing errors, and 100% of trained adults and trained children were able to dose successfully in two human factors validation study with a total of 150 subjects.


 | No risk of needle-related injuries. neffy has no risk of needle-related injuries including injection into a blood vessel, lacerations, or caregiver self-injection since the sprayer device does not have a needle.


 | Less hesitation to dose epinephrine. Early administration of epinephrine can reduce the severity, risk of hospitalization and mortality associated with severe Type I allergic reactions. In patient surveys we have conducted, patients indicated a relief from fear of injection and an expectation to utilize neffy without delay in a manner more consistent with recommended guidelines due to neffy being a nasal spray.


 | Low potent dose of epinephrine. Delivery of higher exposures of epinephrine increases the risk of overexposure and potential adverse events. neffy has high bioavailability matching the approved doses of injection at a low dose of 2.0 or 1.0 mg intranasally. Even in the unlikely situation where epinephrine would be 100% bioavailable after administration of neffy, the resulting exposure is expected to be tolerable.


 | Increased stability over existing treatment options. neffy is expected to have a shelf-life at least comparable to the 18 month shelf-life of auto-injector products, but with improved stability and shelf-life at high-temperature than existing products in the market (up to 3 months at 50oC or 122oF) that allows neffy to retain potency even if accidentally left in a high temperature environment.


 | Combination of previously validated product components. neffy consists of a unique combination of three validated products, which we believe will significantly reduce neffy’s clinical and commercial development risks: epinephrine, which has been approved by regulators and accepted by the physician community as the only effective option to treat Type I allergic reactions; the intranasal device, which has been commercially proven with millions of sprayers sold to date across four FDA-approved products, including NARCAN® for opioid overdose (marketed by Emergent BioSolutions); and Intravail, an innovative absorption enhancer that has been previously included in the formulations of FDA approved products, such as VALTOCO® and TOSYMRA® nasal spray. We believe the cost of goods for neffy will allow us to achieve gross profit margins similar to branded oral small molecule drugs assuming prices comparable to the marketed injectable products.


 | Well positioned for regulatory submissions, and if approved, advance to commercialization. Our NDA was accepted for review by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 with an anticipated mid-2023 PDUFA target action date and we believe that the completed trials are sufficient to serve as the basis for its approval in the United States. In Europe, our Market Authorization Application (“MAA”) was filed and validated for review by EMA in the fourth quarter of 2022.


 | Potential for high demand and attractive product uptake conditions. We have conducted extensive market research with physicians, patients, parents and other caregivers that shows neffy has a clinical product profile that is highly desirable and addresses key unmet needs. We believe we can successfully commercialize neffy by targeting high-prescribing allergists, pediatricians and primary care physicians who we believe will prescribe neffy as it would be a very attractive treatment option within the patient community. In addition, our market research indicates that insurance plans (payors) perceive neffy as a differentiated product candidate, which we believe supports the potential for favorable market access for neffy at net prices comparable to, or at a premium to, the approved intra-muscular injectables. We currently own or exclusively license a robust global intellectual property portfolio including issued composition of matter and method patents relating to neffy that are not expected to expire until 2038 before consideration of any potential patent term extension.

Our Management Team, Financing History and Investors
 We were created to innovate, develop and commercialize neffy, a novel, potentially first-in-class treatment that addresses Type I allergy patients’ desire and need for a no needle, no injection, easy-to-use, portable and reliable solution for delivering epinephrine. To achieve this goal, we have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the development and commercialization of drugs, such as recently approved nasal sprays NARCAN (naloxone nasal spray) and VALTOCO (diazepam nasal spray).

In the first quarter of 2023, we entered into an agreement with Recordati to terminate our prior agreement with it and reacquire Recordati’s rights to develop and commercialize neffy.
Our Pipeline: Suite of neffy Programs
 We are focused on advancing neffy through regulatory approvals for the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and commercialization. neffy is an intranasal composition of epinephrine that is designed to address the limitations of epinephrine intra-muscular injectable products that are available on the market today.
 We submitted our NDA for the 2.0 mg neffy dose for adults and children greater than 30 kg in weight to the FDA in the third quarter of 2022. Our NDA was accepted for review by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 with an anticipated mid-2023 PDUFA target action date. In the EU, our MAA for the 2.0 mg neffy dose for subjects greater than 30 kg in weight was filed and validated for review by EMA in the fourth quarter of 2022. We have also entered into partnerships for the development and commercialization of neffy in regions outside of the U.S., including our partnerships with Alfresa Pharma in Japan and Pediatrix Therapeutics in China to develop and commercialize neffy in those countries.
 Furthermore, we also plan to pursue additional expansion in our pediatric labeling with neffy and are conducting a single-arm pharmacokinetic study in subjects 4 to 18 years of age. The interim pediatric data including subjects greater than 30 kg in weight is included in our initial NDA. We plan to submit a supplemental NDA (“sNDA”) for neffy for children weighing 15 to 30 kilograms to the FDA in 2023. We also plan to submit a post-approval variation to EMA for 1.0 mg neffy following the potential approval of our MAA for the 2.0 mg neffy dose.
In addition, we believe neffy may be able to target other conditions in addition to Type I allergic reactions, and we have identified additional indications for further examination and potential future development.
Our Strategy
 Our strategy is focused on developing and commercializing neffy as a potentially first-in-class approved intranasal treatment for the approximately 16 million patients in the United States who have been diagnosed and experienced severe Type I allergic reactions and are at risk of anaphylaxis, in geographic regions outside of the United States and for other allergy indications. Key elements of our strategy include:

 | Obtain FDA approval of neffy. Our NDA was accepted for review by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 with an anticipated mid-2023 PDUFA target action date. If approved within our expected timeframe, neffy would be the first FDA-approved emergency treatment for Type I allergic reactions that is not an injection and that has no needle, which we believe would be an attractive treatment option for these patients. neffy has received Fast Track designation. However, the timing for regulatory approvals is outside ARS Pharma’s control, may be delayed and is uncertain.


 | Commercialize neffy in the United States. If neffy is approved by the FDA, we plan to initially commercialize it in the United States by deploying a combination of direct promotion, virtual sales consultants, and non-personal promotion intended to reach, at a minimum, the healthcare professionals that account for 45% of the current epinephrine prescriptions. Our promotion will target high-prescribing allergists, pediatricians and primary care physicians through both traditional and non-traditional professional channels. Through these efforts, combined with direct-to-consumer omnichannel strategies to drive awareness and patients asking for neffy, we believe we can quickly and efficiently reach a majority of the approximately 3.3 million patients in the United States who filled a prescription for an epinephrine intra-muscular injectable device in 2021. In addition, we believe that the potential for neffy to address the limitations of auto-injectors will allow us to expand the market opportunity for neffy over time to include the broader population of approximately 2.5 million patients who have received a prescription, but either refused or discontinued treatment in the last three years, as well as the approximately 11 million patients who are diagnosed and under the care of physicians, but have not been prescribed an epinephrine intra-muscular injectable.


 | Commercialize neffy outside of the United States with our partners. We believe that there is significant commercial potential for neffy in markets outside of the United States. In Europe, our MAA was filed and validated for review by EMA in the fourth quarter of 2022. We intend to submit regulatory filings equivalent to an NDA in Japan and China in collaboration with Alfresa Pharma and Pediatrix Therapeutics, respectively, to whom we have granted exclusive licenses in those regions for the development and commercialization of neffy.


 | Conduct additional studies of neffy to address additional Type I allergic reactions. There remains a significant unmet need for treatments for allergies that can produce Type I reactions. We are conducting clinical studies to support the expansion of labeling for neffy to outpatient epinephrine use in other Type I allergy conditions for which epinephrine intra-muscular injectables are not approved.

Overview of Type I Allergic Reactions and Current Challenges
 Overview of Type I Allergic Reactions
 The immune system plays an important role in monitoring and protecting the body against microbial threats. However, this system can lead to overstated immune and inflammatory responses that results in adverse outcomes known as hypersensitivity reactions. Type I allergic reactions are potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions that can occur within minutes following exposure to an allergen and need to be treated immediately to relieve troublesome symptoms, mitigate severity and avoid a potentially fatal event. These severe reactions are caused by exposure to a specific allergen, typically foods (most commonly, nuts, eggs, shellfish), drugs and venoms and are mediated by immunoglobulin E IgE antibodies that bind to mast cells causing the release of histamines. The histamines induce smooth muscle contraction in the airways and a wheal and flare response in the skin producing swelling and inflammation. At the same time, widespread activation of mast cells leads to systemic effects of circulatory shock, hypotension or vascular collapse, and in the most severe cases respiratory arrest and death. The severity of a Type I allergic reaction is a function of the speed of onset and the number of organ systems affected by the reaction. As such, early intervention within minutes is critical in order to provide symptom relief and to prevent severe allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis.
Table 1: Symptoms of Type I Allergic Reactions including Anaphylaxis
 
Body System | Common Symptoms of Type I Allergic Reactions 
Respiratory | Chest tightness, wheezing, difficulty breathingUpper airway or laryngeal angioedema including swelling of throat
Cardiovascular | Hypotension, presyncope (feeling faint), loss of consciousness 
Dermatological | Urticaria (hives) and pruritus (itching) 
Gastrointestinal | Abdominal pain and vomiting

 Role of Epinephrine in Treating Type I Allergic Reactions
 Epinephrine intra-muscular injectables are the only current out-of-hospital treatment for severe Type I allergic reactions and are recommended to be prescribed to all patients who have experienced a severe Type I allergic reaction and have either experienced anaphylaxis or are at risk of anaphylaxis. When properly used, these devices can allow for the early administration of epinephrine to stop or reduce the intensity of the systemic allergic reaction before refractory anaphylaxis develops. Even a few minutes delay in the administration of epinephrine can lead to the need for emergency services and/or hospitalizations, comorbidities and life-threatening symptoms or events, while also prolonging the significant negative impact on patient quality of life by delaying symptom relief.
 EpiPen epinephrine autoinjector was first approved by the FDA for the emergency treatment of Type I hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, in December 1987. Other FDA-approved epinephrine intra-muscular injection products include Twinject® approved in May 2003, Adrenaclick® approved in November 2009, and Auvi-Q® approved in August 2012. In June 2017, the FDA approved Symjepi epinephrine injection, which is a pre-filled syringe for the same indication. These injection devices were approved by the FDA without pharmacokinetic data based on an assumption that injections and devices were all effectively the same as the reference listed drug of intra-muscular injection with a needle and syringe. Intra-muscular injection with a needle and syringe is considered the gold standard, and is almost exclusively used in non-community use clinical settings. Although there are no known differences in efficacy or time to observed effect in clinical practice between these devices, current data indicates that different devices deliver an intra-muscular dose of epinephrine with a range of PKs. A single dose with either an intra-muscular injection with needle and syringe or an auto-injector device results in resolution of allergic reaction for approximately 90% of cases within 5 to 15 minutes.
 Epinephrine works due to its agonistic effects on the body’s adrenergic receptors (alpha and beta receptors). By activating alpha-1 receptors, epinephrine prevents and relieves airway edema, hypotension and shock. By activating beta-1 receptors, epinephrine increases the rate and force of cardiac contractions. Lastly, epinephrine’s effect on beta-2 receptors leads to bronchodilation and decreased allergy causing mediator release by mast cells.



Treatment guidelines recommend that epinephrine be administered immediately at the first sign of a severe allergic reaction. Epinephrine is the only medication that can reverse severe allergic reactions and reduce hospitalization and death. Early administration of epinephrine is associated with better outcomes and decreased likelihood of hospitalizations. The sooner epinephrine is administered following allergen exposure, the less severe the systemic allergic reaction may become, and the less likely it will develop into an anaphylaxis event. A short delay of even a few minutes in the recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis can lead to more serious symptoms, including potential hypoxia or death. Additionally, accompanying symptoms of even non-life-threatening allergic reactions can adversely impact health-related quality of life and can lead to loss of productivity, negatively impact social life, as well as lead to depression and anxiety and feelings of fear, frustration, worry and lack of control. A second dose of epinephrine is required for adequate treatment in about 10% of cases, irrespective of whether epinephrine was dosed using an auto-injector such as EpiPen or needle and syringe.
 While antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, also known as Benadryl® (marketed by Johnson & Johnson), can sometimes relieve the dermatological symptoms and pruritus associated with severe Type I allergic reactions, treatment guidelines state that antihistamines should never be administered instead of epinephrine because they do not reverse the cardiovascular symptoms such as hypotension and shock, or respiratory distress. Instead, antihistamines can potentially mask symptoms and allow the disease to continue to progress silently.
 In the United States, dosing recommendations for epinephrine use by intra-muscular injection are from 0.1 mg to 0.5 mg depending on weight with repeat dosing administered as needed to control a severe allergic reaction. 0.1 mg, 0.15 mg and 0.3 mg are the approved doses for the epinephrine auto-injectors. Approximately 80% of epinephrine auto-injectors prescribed in the United States for outpatient use are the 0.3 mg dose level for persons greater than 30 kg in weight, approximately 15% contain doses of 0.15 mg for persons between 15 to 30 kg and less than 5% contain 0.1 mg doses for persons less than 15 kg. A low dose of epinephrine is important for safety as overexposure to epinephrine can lead to adverse events.
 


Limitations of Existing Epinephrine Products
 

* Reprinted from RECAPEM (image described in the public-domain and freely available).
 Epinephrine intra-muscular injectables have been proven to be highly effective if they are administered timely and effectively, and work as intended, but the limitations of these products include painful application, inconvenient size and a complicated mechanism of administration. These limitations discourage patients and caregivers from carrying these devices and administering epinephrine in a timely manner. Both uptake and use of intra-muscular injection devices has been limited among eligible patients with severe Type I allergic reactions at risk of anaphylaxis. Of the approximately 16 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed and experienced Type I severe allergic reactions, only 3.3 million currently have an active and filled epinephrine autoinjector prescription.
 In studies published in peer-reviewed journals, only 23% to 48% of patients self-administered with an auto-injector during a severe Type I allergic reaction, likely due to less than half of patients actually carrying their prescribed injection device, and only half administering even if the device was available. Across our market research studies, approximately 40% to 60% of patients reported using an antihistamine first, which is not known to be effective, and if carrying an intra-muscular injectable, waited an average of 8 to 18 minutes to administer the device. The principal device-related reasons for delay were presence of a needle, concern about serious cardiac side effects, and potential pain. Patients, and particularly parents who administer to their child, perceive injection to be traumatic, which leads to a fear and avoidance of administering timely treatment. Further, the potentially life-threatening nature of a severe Type I allergic reaction is often accompanied with psychological stress and panic which can lead to delays or errors in proper intra-muscular injection, which can result in hospitalization or even death. In a meta-analysis of 32 studies evaluating epinephrine injectable administration techniques, 23% to 35% of participants failed to achieve the correct administration technique following training.
 Further, there is variability in respect to whether auto-injector devices are able to reliably deliver a sufficient dose of epinephrine. The FDA has reported that EpiPen device failures lead to multiple deaths and dozens of hospitalizations annually.
 The injection needle can be painful and dangerous not just due to the risk of skin lacerations and the possibility of the needle hitting a patient’s bone during administration, but also the risk of serious, sudden cardiovascular events resulting from accidental blood vessel injection. In our clinical studies, we observed instances of potential accidental blood vessel injection in approximately 14% of patients dosing themselves with EpiPen.
 In comparison, neffy is perceived by patients and parents as a potentially “game changing” device that, if approved, could improve the management of severe Type I allergic reactions by addressing the current limitations of epinephrine intra-muscular injectable devices.


Clinical Development of neffy
 
neffy is designed to provide injection-like absorption of epinephrine at a 1.0 or 2.0 mg dose comparable to 0.3 mg injection, in a small, easy-to-carry, easy-to-use, rapidly administered and reliable nasal spray. Based on our development work to date, we believe neffy’s “no needle, no injection” clinical profile supports differentiation over intra-muscular injections for the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.
 We submitted our NDA to the FDA in the third quarter of 2022 based on a rigorous clinical development program agreed upon during pre-NDA meeting discussion with the FDA in mid-2021. Our NDA was accepted for review by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 with an anticipated mid-2023 PDUFA target action date. The FDA reference listed drug is intra-muscular needle-in-syringe injection products but there are several approved epinephrine intra-muscular injection products, including intra-muscular auto-injectors such as EpiPen, that establish a range of exposures that have indistinguishable efficacy, time to observed clinical effect and safety.
 During our pre-NDA meeting in mid-2021, FDA agreed that bracketing based on the primary parameters of Cmax, tmax and early partial AUCs from the range of PKs observed in listed epinephrine injection products was the best approach to ensure efficacy and safety, while bracketing by AUC0-t was considered an important parameter to ensure safety. PD measures of epinephrine activity such as systolic blood pressure and pulse rate were agreed to be supportive, and to be not meaningfully lower than injection. FDA also agreed that successfully demonstrating that neffy met these criteria in three primary studies described below would be sufficient to serve as a basis for our registration program for adults. Furthermore, FDA also agreed that a single study in pediatric subjects also described below would be sufficient to support our pediatric labeling.
 We have completed three registrational clinical trials in adults using our 2.0 neffy dose for which we submitted our NDA to the FDA in the third quarter of 2022. The adult registrational program using the 2.0 mg neffy was intended to generate bioavailability, PDs and safety data in three primary studies: (i) during single and repeat dosing in healthy subjects (EPI-15), (ii) during self-administration by subjects with severe Type I allergies (EPI-17), and (iii) during rhinitis induced by a nasal challenge with an allergen (EPI-16). EPI-15 was conducted in the United States on behalf of ARS Pharma by WCCT Global, Inc., a third-party contract research organization, and selected for 59 healthy male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 to 55 years. EPI-16 was conducted in the United States on behalf of ARS Pharma by Altasciences Clinical Los Angeles, Inc., a third-party contract research organization, and selected 36 male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 to 55 years with a positive history of seasonal allergic rhinitis related to tree or grass allergens as demonstrated by skin prick test and nasal allergen challenge at screening. EPI-17 was conducted in the United States on behalf of ARS Pharma by Novum Pharmaceutical Research Services, a third party contract research organization, and selected 45 male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 to 55 years who had an ongoing history of Type I allergies. To support our proposed pediatric labeling, we are also conducting a single-arm pharmacokinetic study in subjects 4 to 18 years of age with either 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg of neffy depending on the subject’s weight (EPI-10). EPI-10 is being conducted in the United States by ARS Pharma and selected 42 male or female subjects between the ages of 4 and 18 years who have Type I allergies that required that the subject or caregiver been prescribed an epinephrine product. The interim results of this study from 57 subjects including 16 subjects dosed with 2.0 mg neffy were included in our initial NDA that was accepted for review by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 In addition, we have completed two proof of concept clinical studies that evaluated the bioavailability of our 2.0 mg neffy dose. These two earlier-stage studies were conducted in the United States on behalf of ARS Pharma by WCCT Global, Inc. and Altasciences Clinical Los Angeles, Inc, respectively, and selected a total of 26 healthy male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 to 55 years, and 42 male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 to 55 years who had an ongoing history of type I allergies.


2.0 mg neffy is intended to be the dose that is comparable to approved 0.3 mg epinephrine intra-muscular injection products for persons greater than 30 kg in weight, which represents approximately 80% of the prescriptions in the United States. 1.0 mg neffy is intended to be the dose for persons 15 to 30 kg in weight. Our NDA for the 2.0 mg dose of neffy for adults and children 30 kg and greater in weight was accepted for review by FDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 with an anticipated mid-2023 PDUFA target action date. We plan to submit a supplemental NDA for the 1.0 mg dose of neffy in 2023 for subjects 15 to 30 kg in weight.
 In our clinical studies in both adults and children, 2.0 mg neffy gave comparable epinephrine exposures that were within the range of approved intra-muscular injection products (needle-in-syringe products and EpiPen) on key pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, tmax, early partial AUCs, AUC0-t). The integrated data analysis summarizing the key outcomes for registration are shown below.
 
The hemodynamic response, measured by systolic blood pressure and heart rate, after administration of neffy was comparable to some injection products including EpiPen, and was greater than 0.3 mg intra-muscular needle-with-syringe. These hemodynamic responses were within normal physiologic ranges that are typically experienced during exercise or climbing stairs.
 Across all the clinical trials, a total of more than 600 subjects have been exposed to neffy. All doses of neffy ranging from 0.5 mg to 2.0 mg single doses, as well as repeat doses up to 4 mg within 10 minutes, were well-tolerated by patients. There is no meaningful pain upon administration of neffy with average scores of 5 to 8 as assessed on a 100 mm visual analogue scale, across studies. There was no irritation observed based on formal scoring in all studies. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events, and adverse events reported have generally not resulted in side effects more severe than grade 1, and were comparable to injection products. Since neffy is given without needle, there was also no needle-related injuries or accidental blood vessel injections.
 In contrast, for patients self-administering devices, which involved 132 subjects dosed for each of EpiPen and Symjepi, approximately 14% of subjects dosed with EpiPen (auto-injector) and 2% of subjects dosed with Symjepi (pre-filled needle-in-syringe) experienced a potential blood vessel injection leading to a rapid bolus dose of epinephrine, which could lead to serious side effects including cardiovascular events and cerebral hemorrhage according to the FDA EpiPen label. No subjects dosed with neffy experienced a blood vessel injection since it is not possible via the nasal route of administration.
 Furthermore, our registrational self-administration study of 2.0 mg neffy by adults with severe Type I allergies (EPI-17) showed no critical dosing errors with neffy as evaluated by human factors professionals. Furthermore, neffy also showed zero dosing errors in two human factor validation studies involving 150 subjects when used by trained adults or trained children across multiple demographic groups, as well as when used by passers-byers with no prior experience or training with an epinephrine device.


 Key features of neffy demonstrated in our clinical, human factors or stability studies include:
 

Clinical Feature | Supporting Clinical Data 
Comparable PKs at a low dose of epinephrine | Cmax, tmax and AUCs were within the range of approved intra-muscular injection products with a low intranasal dose of 2.0 mg neffy (people >30 kg in weight) and 1.0 mg neffy(people 15 – 30 kg weight). 
Robust PDs within a range comparable to injection products with no risk of accidental blood vessel injections | PD responses including systolic blood pressure and heart rate were within normal physiologic changes and comparable to auto-injector products, with maximum changes less that of the EpiPen.neffy has no potential for the accidental blood vessel injections observed with injection products such as EpiPen, which can lead to rapid and high epinephrine exposures that cause rapid increases in systolic blood pressure and can lead to cerebral hemorrhage or other cardiovascular side effects.
No meaningful pain or irritation after administration | Visual analogue scale scores were an average of 5 to 8 on a 100 mm scale, and show no meaningful pain (or burning or stinging sensation) after administration, attributable to neffy being an aqueous formulation. There is also no irritation observed based on formal scoring.Needle containing intra-muscular injection products are known to be painful and cause reluctance to dose. 
Easy to use | No critical dosing errors during self-administration with 2.0 mg neffy by type I allergy adult subjects (EPI-17).Zero percent error rate in two human factors studies with 150 persons, when used by trained adults or trained children and when used by untrained passers-byers. 
Easy to carry | neffy is comparable in size to a wireless earbud case, and multiple neffy devices can fit in a patient or parent’s pocket to satisfy guideline recommendations. 
High reliability | neffy ’s sprayer device is designed to deliver the effective dose more than 99.999% of the time, with no recalls or warnings among the millions of the same nasal sprayer devices sold to date. 
No breathing or inhalation required | neffy is designed to be absorbed passively through the nasal mucosa without any inhalation, sniffing or breathing required, with its particles too large to enter the lungs. 
Injection-like absorption even with nasal congestion | neffy reaches exposures comparable to approved injectable products even after induction of moderate to severe nasal rhinitis and/or edema (e.g., nasal congestion) 
Shelf-life at least comparable to injection products, but also with high temperature stability | Drug stability studies show that neffy has a shelf-life at least comparable to the 18 month shelf-life of EpiPen, but with high temperature stability, based on stability data from the 2.0 mg dose of neffy for 12 months and the 1.0 mg dose of neffy for 24 months.neffy remains within specifications even when exposed to temperatures of 50oC (122oF) for at least three months, or temperatures of 40oC (104oF) for at least six months. 

Planned Clinical Trials in Additional Indications
 Epinephrine has been used empirically by physicians and included in treatment guidelines for multiple allergy conditions that do not fall under the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions indication that epinephrine auto-injectors are labelled for. The needle-free, portable, easy-to-use and potentially safer clinical profile of neffy supported by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data could enable the broader adoption of epinephrine in the outpatient setting for these other indications. We are conducting proof of concept studies evaluating neffy in additional allergy indications where neffy could potentially be used multiple times a year to treat acute episodes.


Development outside the United States
 In Europe, our MAA was filed and validated for review by EMA in the fourth quarter of 2022.In the Day 120 comments, we received during EMA’s review of our prior 1.0 mg dose neffy MAA submission, EMA required a preclinical dog anaphylaxis study, which we completed with data showing no meaningful differences in epinephrine absorption of neffy in dogs in a normal state or an anaphylactic state. In April 2022, we voluntarily withdrew our 1.0 mg neffy MAA submission to re-submit a 2.0 mg neffy MAA submission and allow EMA to review both our 2.0 mg neffy and preclinical dog anaphylaxis study results.
 We are also pursuing pediatric approval of neffy in Europe based on the same US pediatric study. We plan to submit a post-approval variation to EMA for the 1.0 mg neffy following the potential approval of the 2.0 mg neffy dose.
 Our partners in Japan and China expect that they will file for regulatory approval in their respective regions at end of 2023 or early 2024 following our anticipated FDA approval of neffy.
 
Commercialization Opportunity and Commercialization Plan
 
Type I Allergy Market Overview
 neffy is a needle-free, low-dose intranasal epinephrine nasal spray in clinical development for use as a rescue medication for people with Type I severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. neffy was designed to provide injection-like absorption of epinephrine, in a small, easy-to-carry, easy-to-use, rapidly administered, and reliable nasal spray device.
 All systemic allergic reactions have the potential of progressing to anaphylaxis and becoming life-threatening. These reactions can be unpredictable and progress quickly to develop severe symptoms within a few minutes after exposure and can progress to a life-threatening event if not treated immediately. Patient and caregiver preparedness to act quickly and confidently during a severe allergic reaction is imperative. Hesitation can lead to worse clinical outcomes and can be fatal.
 Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Epinephrine needs to be given as soon as symptoms occur because it is the only medication proven to stop a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.
 Needle-free and easy-to-use neffy may allow for improved patient and caregiver preparedness to give epinephrine quickly, confidently, and without hesitation that is caused by fear of the needle. Intended for use at the first signs of an allergic response, neffy is designed to provide patients and their families with a new option to rapidly resolve symptoms and prevent progression to severe anaphylaxis.
 If approved for use, we believe our first-in-class nasal spray may transform the way we think about and use life-saving epinephrine.
 
Existing US Market Opportunity
 We estimate approximately 25 to 40 million people in the United States have experienced Type I allergic reactions. Of this group, approximately 16 million people have been diagnosed and experienced severe Type I allergic reactions that may lead to anaphylaxis, but only about 3.3 million of them filled a prescription in 2021 for an epinephrine intra-muscular injectable device, including auto-injectors, equating to approximately 10 million devices.
 Of those 3.3 million people, roughly half don’t carry these devices due to many drawbacks that can result in patient and caregiver injury, hesitation, and delays in administration principally because of apprehension and pain of needles. In turn, the failure or delay of epinephrine delivery can allow the allergic reaction to progress in severity causing life-threatening symptoms or events that potentially require emergency services and/or hospitalization.
 We believe neffy could address the needs of not only the approximately 3.3 million patients in the United States who currently fill intra-muscular injectable prescriptions, but also the more than 22 million eligible Type I allergy patients in the United States who are at risk of severe allergic reactions that are not prescribed or do not fill their epinephrine prescriptions, including approximately 2.5 million former injectable patients in the United States in the last three years that either refused to fill, or did not renew an intramuscular injectable device prescription.
 Based on market access research and data from IQVIA, we estimate that 2021 U.S. net sales for intra-muscular injectable devices were approximately $1 billion. Approximately 80% of the epinephrine intra-muscular injectables sold in the United States in 2021 were for the 0.3 mg dose for adults and children greater than 30 kg in weight.


We have conducted multiple market research studies with caregivers, generally parents, and patients with severe Type I allergic reactions in the United States to evaluate potential market perceptions of neffy and currently available epinephrine delivery devices. Based on two independent quantitative market research studies including a total of 350 patients and 75 allergists, pediatricians and primary care physicians, approximately 80% of patients with a current epinephrine auto-injector prescription stated that they would prefer neffy. Furthermore, 100% of the physicians surveyed stated they would prescribe if their patient asked for neffy, indicating that neffy prescriptions would likely be highly driven by patient preference and awareness of neffy.
 In our market research, parents and people with current or prior epinephrine auto-injector prescriptions were asked if and when they would adopt a new nasal spray device product such as neffy.
 

 | A majority indicated they would adopt neffy within three months of it coming to market,


 | 69% of patients indicated they would use neffy sooner than their current auto-injector device,


 | 65 to 72% of patients indicated that they would use neffy first instead of an over-the-counter antihistamine


 | 88% reported they would be more willing to use neffy in public.

 These data suggest that neffy has the potential to be rapidly adopted by most of the approximately 3.3 million patients in the United States today who fill their epinephrine auto-injector prescription, if approved. These patients serve as our base estimate for the current epinephrine market for neffy.
 Key potential growth levers for neffy within the existing epinephrine market for the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions, which currently consists of only intra-muscular injectable products include:
 
 | Consistent base market growth observed with the epinephrine intra-muscular injectable products. From 2007 to 2021, the number of epinephrine intra-muscular injectable devices sold in the United States has increased by approximately 5% annually based on IQVIA unit sales data, primarily due to the increasing size of the overall population affected by severe Type I allergies, led by food-based allergies.


 | Potential promotional lift due to new marketing and education efforts by a branded product such as neffy. The existing market for epinephrine intra-muscular injectable products is characterized by being highly promotionally sensitive, particularly from a consumer perspective, and our market research has indicated that neffy’s user-friendly product profile has the potential to resonate significantly with consumers. We estimate that branded marketing of EpiPen prior to generic entry contributed a promotional lift of 31% over base epinephrine intra-muscular injectable market trends. We plan to reach and support patients directly through efficient direct-to-consumer advertising after educating professional physician practices and securing appropriate payer coverage for neffy.


 | Targeting the approximately 2.5 million former patients that either do not fill their epinephrine intra-muscular injectables prescriptions or whose prescriptions have recently lapsed. The exodus of patients who have received prescriptions from the market has been attributed to a number of factors, including reduced promotional activities in recent years, limited adherence program effectiveness (lapsed prescriptions) and patient adversity to currently marketed products (i.e., fear of needles and concerns regarding poor reliability). In our market research of 100 former patients who refused to fill or renew a prescription, approximately 75% indicated a willingness to return to the market and request neffy if approved. We hope to engage with these patients through programs to encourage appropriate epinephrine use with neffy and increase consistency of epinephrine acquisition to help manage their condition.


 | Increased per patient device acquisition by patients and parents. In our market research of 350 patients with an active intra-muscular injectable prescription, approximately 70% to 80% of patients reported an intention to acquire additional devices compared to their current injectable device if neffy is approved by the FDA. Currently, we estimate only between 20% to 30% of patients currently obtain more than one pack (containing two devices) per year today.

US Market Expansion Opportunity
 While we believe the existing epinephrine intra-muscular injectables market is a large commercial opportunity for neffy with multiple independent opportunities for further growth, IQVIA claims data indicates that many diagnosed, identifiable eligible patients do not receive prescriptions for intra-muscular injectables. Outside of the five million patients who were recently prescribed an epinephrine injectable device, there are approximately 11 million patients who are under the care of physicians per IQVIA claims data, but have not been prescribed an epinephrine intra-muscular injectable device, as well as another approximately 9 million patients not currently under the care of physicians.

 | Over time, targeting the approximately 11 million identified and diagnosed in-office patients in IQVIA claims data with Type I allergic reactions that are eligible but have not been prescribed epinephrine device. In our market research, physicians indicated they would prescribe neffy to more than half of the patients who were eligible, but do not currently receive an intra-muscular injectable prescription.


 | Development in new allergy indications. There are approximately 10 million patients with allergy conditions (e.g., urticaria flares and asthma exacerbations) where epinephrine has never been formally developed as a prescription product, despite being used in-hospital to resolve such acute symptoms. Such patients in other conditions experience multiple episodes each year, and we believe they would likely use multiple neffy each year to resolve their symptoms. Therefore, the market opportunity for treating such conditions may be as large as the type I allergy including anaphylaxis indication.We are conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled proof of concept study evaluating the safety and efficacy of neffy in approximately 24 subjects with frequent urticaria flares. We expect to complete enrollment and report topline data from this study in the second half of 2023.

Ex-US Market Opportunity
 
 | Outside of the United States, we estimate that there are an additional 15 million patients in Europe, and over 30 million patients in Asia including China and Japan, that experience Type I allergic reactions that are clinically appropriate for being prescribed neffy.


 | In 2021, epinephrine intra-muscular injectable sales outside the United States were approximately $250 million based on IQVIA data. In Europe and Japan, sales of epinephrine injectable devices are approximately $160 million. We believe education around Type I allergic reactions and marketing of intra-muscular injectables has been limited in these regions, and that promotion and the availability of neffy would significantly expand the market.


 | Market research conducted in Europe with 120 patients who have an epinephrine auto-injector prescription indicated that 98% would prefer neffy, and that they would acquire approximately twice as many neffy devices compared to their current injectable device, if approved.


 | To target these opportunities outside of the United States, we have entered into licensing and collaboration agreements with Alfresa Pharma for Japanese rights to neffy and Pediatrix Therapeutics (founded by F-Prime Capital, Eight Roads and Creacion Ventures) for Chinese rights to neffy. We intend to pursue strategic partnerships for the commercialization of neffy in additional regions outside of the United States, subject to FDA approval of neffy.


 | We previously entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Recordati for development and commercialization rights in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Russia/CIS, Turkey, the Middle East and French-speaking African countries. In the first quarter of 2023, we entered into an agreement with Recordati to terminate our prior agreement with it and reacquire Recordati’s rights to develop and commercialize neffy.

Commercial Strategy



We believe that the epinephrine market is a highly consumer driven market. We expect this to be especially true for neffy, given that 100% of the physicians surveyed in our quantitative market research studies indicated that they would prescribe neffy if asked by a patient and approximately 70% of physicians would recommend neffy. As a result, we believe that driving consumer awareness, so that patients and parents ask their healthcare provider for neffy, while minimizing both access and educational barriers to acceptance is essential.
 Our plan to execute on our go-to-market strategy for neffy includes the following:
 We plan to create healthcare professional and consumer awareness and anticipation prior to launch. We are refining our go-to-market strategy and creating awareness about our company and our technology. We expect to expand medical affairs capabilities prior to commercial launch to establish additional relationships with key opinion leaders and gain insight into current practice patterns and burdens. The medical affairs team will also collaborate with the commercial team to help payers fully understand neffy’s value proposition and the limitations associated with needle injectors. We also plan to begin to raise awareness and support meaningful education through partnership with patient advocacy groups and medical societies as well as a disease education campaign including through social media and digital.
 Based on the unmet needs that we identified, our pre-launch activities may be focused on delivering disease awareness and education surrounding the appropriate epinephrine use to prevent anaphylaxis to allergists and pediatricians as well as parents and patients in partnership with allergy and professional advocacy groups. These disease education efforts will more specifically reinforce the importance of early administration of epinephrine at the first sign of a severe Type I allergic reaction, help stakeholders understand the factors that are associated with hesitation to fill and use epinephrine earlier in a reaction, and the importance of alternative epinephrine delivery options to support those affected by severe allergic reactions. In our market research, 42% of patients who had used an epinephrine injectable device during a recent episode reported that they delayed use by an average of approximately 9 minutes. If neffy were available, these patients reported that they would reduce their average wait time to use by 45%. Additionally, 47% of patients reported they were more likely to fill prescriptions and 86% of patients reported they would carry neffy with them. We believe a broad understanding of this evidence will help to establish and increase the urgency to treat patients with neffy and support our rapid launch uptake following FDA approval, if achieved.
 We plan to initially commercialize neffy in the United States with a combination of direct promotion, virtual sales consultants, and non-personal promotion intended to reach, at a minimum, the healthcare professionals that account for 45% of the current epinephrine prescriptions. Our promotion will focus the launch on the highest potential practicing allergists, pediatricians, and primary care physicians. In our market research, approximately 80% of patients see their treating physicians at least every six months, and 98% at least once a year. We plan to optimize our field representatives based on planned research on current market dynamics, geo-targeting and assessment of current professional-industry interaction preferences initially to reach these professionals. We expect significant reach to be achieved based on expanded use of non-personal promotional tactics and virtual sales representatives to reach healthcare professionals and focus on the sequential activation of patient demand through direct-to-consumer tactics that will help also drive physician awareness due to overlapping exposure.


We intend to partner with patient advocacy organizations as well as influencers and leverage an omnichannel strategy including direct-to-patient and parent tactics, social and traditional media, digital presence, and additional public relations to drive awareness, for patients to ask for neffy, and communicate our value proposition. The pent-up patient demand that we believe is ready to be activated by neffy is reflected in our market research where 87% of patients indicated a high likelihood to proactively visit their physician in-person and ask about getting a new prescription for neffy (43% of patients indicating a 10 out of 10 likelihood, and 44% of patients indicating a 7-9 out of 10 likelihood). Our research also showed that physicians would recommend neffy to approximately 70% of their patients. In addition, the severe Type I allergy market has historically been highly promotionally sensitive, and in recent years, there has been limited investment in education or promotion, which we believe provides an opportunity for significant promotional lift from our planned marketing efforts.
 We intend to establish neffy as the dominant and most recognized brand in the category. We believe neffy’s potential brand recognition and user-friendly profile can be an important driver of growth and source of competitive differentiation, especially as the first “no needle, no injection” solution for severe Type I allergic reactions. We have designed neffy to offer healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers a simple, injection-free, portable, highly reliable and user-friendly alternative that facilitates early administration of epinephrine to provide rapid symptom relief and to stop the allergic reaction from progressing to more serious events. We believe the attractiveness and meaningful differentiation of neffy across both physicians and payers will stimulate a high patient and parent desire to switch to or return to managing their condition with neffy.
 We intend to secure affordable market access for all consumers by optimizing contracting, co-pay support and distribution of neffy. To ensure access and affordability for neffy, we plan to engage with payors to convey the clinical rationale and value proposition of neffy. To date, we have conducted extensive market research with approximately 50 decision-makers at payors to help forecast the potential commercial opportunity for neffy in the United States. Health insurers surveyed have indicated that neffy is perceived as differentiated brand from epinephrine auto-injector products, with its needle-free route of administration and increased likelihood of being carried as the most important product attributes. Based on these analyses and our planned contracting strategy, we believe payers can support favorable and broad market access for neffy. Further, we will offer comprehensive patient support programs in the form of co-pay buydowns to help ensure access and affordability for all patients.
 We intend to expand the market beyond the 3.3 million patients currently filling epinephrine injection device prescriptions. We believe that the severe Type I allergy market is currently significantly underpenetrated due to the lack of, and limitations in, current treatment options. We believe the availability of neffy could drive increased device uptake among the existing 3.3 million patients currently filling epinephrine injection device prescriptions, adoption by the approximately 2.5 million patient that receive, but do not fill their prescription, and the 11 million patients diagnosed and managed by physicians who do not currently have an epinephrine auto-injector, especially those incorrectly using antihistamines as a substitute. Other launches of intranasal products for emergency use into previously injection-only markets such as NARCAN (marketed by Emergent BioSolutions), VALTOCO (marketed by Neurelis), NAYZILAM (marketed by UCB) and BAQSIMI (marketed by Eli Lilly) have rapidly captured a significant percentage of the existing market, and also expanded their respective markets. Both products use the same device that we have chosen for neffy. We believe that NARCAN’s widespread use clearly demonstrates market uptake in response to the advantages of an intranasal product via proven device over injection, considering in particular that NARCAN is used in life threatening rescue situations where reliable administration is required for confident administration, similar to severe Type I allergic reactions. Beyond just reliability, we believe that an intranasal product has unique advantages for treating a severe Type I allergic reaction due to patient and parent fear and avoidance of injection and because time is of the essence. This perspective is distinct from other diseases with chronic use of injection products, administration by a trained professional is required, or where the injection is more manageable and tolerated. In our market research, respondents have described neffy as “game-changing” and we believe neffy, if approved, can make a significant difference in patient lives and outcomes.
 If approved, we plan to establish a distribution channel in the United States for the commercialization of neffy. We expect to sell neffy to wholesalers, who, in turn, will sell our neffy to retailors and other customers. We expect to use a third-party logistics provider for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration, order management and chargeback processing and accounts receivable management. We also plan to explore other non-traditional distribution channels including telemedicine.
 To target markets outside of the United States, we have entered into strategic partnerships with several pharmaceutical companies to obtain regulatory approval and market neffy. These include Alfresa Pharma for Japan and Pediatrix Therapeutics for China. We intend to pursue strategic partnerships for the commercialization of neffy in additional regions outside of the United States, subject to FDA approval of neffy. We anticipate that in certain markets additional clinical trials of neffy may be required to obtain regulatory approval and/or ensure market access.
 

Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, commercial and human resources than we do and significantly more experience in the discovery, development and regulatory approval of product candidates and the commercialization of those products. We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of neffy and the other product candidates that we may develop are their efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, value and price, in addition to whether there are alternative therapies approved for other indications and prescribed for off-label use and the availability of reimbursement from the government and other third parties. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if our competitors have products which are better in one or more of these categories.
 We expect that, if approved, neffy would compete with a number of existing products and other product candidates that target Type I allergic reactions, including certain products that are or may become generic products. Additionally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our current or future product candidates non-competitive or obsolete.
 We anticipate that, if approved, neffy will compete primarily against epinephrine intra-muscular injectable products, for the emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions including EpiPen and its generics, which are marketed by Viatris, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., respectively; Adrenaclick, which is marketed by Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Auvi-Q, which is marketed by Kaleo, Inc.; and Symjepi, which is marketed by Sandoz, Inc., a Novartis division.
 We are not aware of any other company that has a “no needle, no injection” epinephrine product candidate in clinical development in the United States that has demonstrated PKs bracketed by the approved injection products for all pharmacokinetic parameters requested by the FDA. We are also not aware of any “no needle, no injection” epinephrine product candidate for the pediatric population that is in clinical development.
 We are aware of several companies developing higher dose intranasal candidates including Bryn Pharma, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (previously INSYS Therapeutics, Inc.), Nasus Pharma and Orexo AB. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is reported to be developing an intranasal candidate, but has not disclosed its dose. Aquestive Therapeutics is developing a sublingual candidate based on a prodrug of epinephrine.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of neffy, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations for clinical materials or commercial products in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials.
 We currently rely on suppliers for raw materials including drug substance and multiple manufacturers for our product candidates and expect to rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the commercial supply of any approved products. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants as needed to manage our CMOs. These CMOs offer a comprehensive range of contract manufacturing and packaging services and have successfully handled the scale up of neffy in preparation for commercialization.
 neffy is presented as a nasal spray in aqueous solution with epinephrine as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) filled into glass vials and closed with a rubber stopper and assembled into the unit dose sprayer device. Over time, epinephrine is oxidized and loses potency resulting in a finite shelf-life, and the neffy solution inside the unit dose sprayer changes to an amber to brown color.
 Epinephrine is the API used in neffy. We intend to use Cambrex Profarmco (“Cambrex”) as one of our commercial sources for epinephrine API. Cambrex holds a U.S. drug master file for epinephrine produced at its facility in Italy, and its manufacturing process is fully validated. We have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Cambrex, and while we believe that Cambrex has sufficient capacity to satisfy our long-term requirements, there are several sources of API available, and we intend to launch with a second source of API and are in the process of qualifying this second API source.
 Dodecyl maltoside or Intravail is purchased through our license agreement with Aegis Therapeutics, Inc. from two manufacturers, Dr. Reddy Laboratories and Inalco, which are based in India and Italy, respectively.
 The unit dose sprayer device used to delivery drug product in neffy is produced by Aptar Pharma (“Aptar”). Aptar produces devices in France and we believe Aptar has sufficient capacity to satisfy our long-term requirements. The patent for the Aptar unit dose nasal spray device expired in early 2020, and we believe there will be generic supplies available soon after launch.


Manufacturing drug product for neffy is conducted by Renaissance Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Renaissance Pharma”), which has been actively involved in supporting the manufacture of neffy devices in our clinical development. We intend to use its facility in Lakewood, New Jersey as our primary source for drug product manufacturing and final packaging. We have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Renaissance Pharma, and believe they have sufficient capacity to satisfy our long-term requirements, although we are evaluating alternating sourcing options.
 Ongoing stability studies demonstrate that neffy is stable at room temperature for at least 18 months, based on stability data from the 2.0 mg dose of neffy for 12 months and the 1.0 mg dose of neffy for 24 months, and we plan to continue to conduct ongoing registration stability studies that we anticipate will enable us to indicate on our label, if approved, that neffy is stable at room temperature for 18 months at 25oC. We have also conducted studies indicating that neffy is also stable at temperature excursions including 40oC for up to six months, and at 50oC for up to three months.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect our intranasal epinephrine product candidates by seeking, maintaining, and defending our patent rights in the United States and internationally. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 We co-own or exclusively license the patents and patent applications relating to our intranasal epinephrine product candidates. As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio consisted of issued patents and pending patent applications that we co-own or exclusively license from Aegis Therapeutics LLC in the United States and other countries throughout the world. In total, as of that date, our patent portfolio consisted of four issued U.S. patents, one granted Australian patent, one granted Japanese patent, one granted Chinese patent, one granted patent in South Korea, one granted European patent, three granted United Kingdom patents, three pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and over fifteen pending foreign patent applications directed to intranasal epinephrine formulations and methods of their use. These issued patents and pending patent applications are expected to expire as early as 2038, absent any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions for regulatory delay.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, and other proprietary information to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek trademark protection in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions where available and when we deem appropriate. We currently have registrations for our “neffy” mark in the United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”


We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with companies with whom we share proprietary and confidential information in the course of business discussions, and by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators, and other collaborators and contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them while in our employ. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The patent positions of specialty pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 As a pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA, before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
 neffy is comprised of drug and delivery device components that would normally be subject to different regulatory frameworks by the FDA and frequently regulated by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product.
 A combination product with a primary mode of action attributable to the drug component, such as neffy, generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes set forth in the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA for such a product, however, FDA reviewers would consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product – the sprayer - met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products such as neffy are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System Regulations applicable to medical devices.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA, and implementing regulations. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

 | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations and other applicable regulations;


 | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


 | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good clinical practice (“GCP”) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;


 | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


 | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA to assess compliance with GCP regulations;


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP requirements. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.


Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
  Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
 | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


 | Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


 | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage and clinical efficacy at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit/risk ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.

 Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.


U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the Pediatric Research Equity Act does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows the advisory committee’s recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or (an) additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.


If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
 
Fast Track Designation
 The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, the FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
 Fast track designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, such designations or shortened review periods may not provide a material commercial advantage.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products.
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the drug product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.


The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


 | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;


 | clinical holds on clinical studies;


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;


 | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;


 | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;


 | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.


Hatch-Waxman Act
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
 Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing new chemical entities that have not been previously approved by the FDA. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug’s approval. As a general matter, the three year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.


Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 
Other Healthcare Laws
 In the United States, we are subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws, such as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
  The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 In addition, the federal civil monetary penalties law, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program.
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), imposes certain requirements on covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.


The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing information and marketing expenditures or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 Violations of any of these laws and other applicable healthcare fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including significant fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. In the United States, no uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products among third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Some third-party payors require pre-approval of coverage for new drugs before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. Generally, third-party payors limit coverage and reimbursement for new medication prior to a formal review by the payors’ pharmacy and therapeutics committees. As such, several third-party payors have indicated that our products may be subject to denial or limited coverage prior to formal review. There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug or therapeutic biologic is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
 Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Moreover, as a condition of participating in, and having products covered under, certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, we are subject to federal laws and regulations that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as Medicaid Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”), and Best Price, Medicare Average Sales Price, the 340B Ceiling Price, and Non-Federal AMP reported to the Department of Veteran Affairs, and with respect to Medicaid, pay statutory rebates on utilization of manufacturers’ products by Medicaid beneficiaries.


In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that a product will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability to sell a product profitably.
 
Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. For example, implementation of the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts (increased to 70 percent, effective as of January 1, 2019) off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive, and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Congress is considering additional health reform measures.


Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries, and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, would eliminate the statutory cap on rebate amounts owed by drug manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”), which is currently capped at 100% of the AMP for a covered outpatient drug.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services.
 
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, local, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations related to data privacy, security, and protection, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. Such obligations may include, without limitation, HIPAA, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”).HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates and covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the CCPA, the CPRA and the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 In addition, Congress and various other states have enacted or are considering new laws and regulations regarding the privacy and security of heath and other personal information to which we may become subject. Further, all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. We intend to continue to protect all personal information in our control and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information.


The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA regulates the processing of personal information of California residents and increases the privacy and security obligations of covered companies handling such personal information, including requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California residents, and affords such residents new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information that may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. Moreover, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, – a consumer privacy ballot initiative that amends and expands the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2023, and expands the CCPA. The CPRA affords California residents significantly more control over their personal information, imposes heightened compliance obligations on covered companies, and establishes a new enforcement agency dedicated to consumer privacy. While aspects of the CCPA and CPRA and its interpretation remain to be determined in practice, they create further uncertainty and may result in additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply.
 Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. As one example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we or our potential collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of an application for a clinical trial authorization (“CTA”) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an application made to an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements and a favorable ethics committee opinion has been issued, clinical trial development may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials are to a significant extent harmonized at the EU level, but could vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures. The application used to file an NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, but the exact requirements for authorization may vary.
 Centralized Procedure.  The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases, other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for other products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health or which contain a new active substance for indications other than those specified to be compulsory.


National Authorization Procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 

 | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU Member State of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.


 | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition in the EU and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the investment required to develop the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free or reduced-fee protocol assistance, fee reductions for marketing authorization applications and other post-authorization activities and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 In the EU, early access mechanisms for innovative medicines (such as compassionate use programs and named patient supplies), pricing and reimbursement, and promotion and advertising, amongst other things, are subject to national regulations and oversight by national competent authorities and therefore significantly vary from country to country.
 Sanctions for non-compliance with the aforementioned requirements, which may include administrative and criminal penalties, are generally determined and enforced at national level. However, under the EU financial penalties regime, the EMA can investigate and report on alleged breaches of the EU pharmaceutical rules by holders of a marketing authorization for centrally authorized medicinal products and the European Commission could adopt decisions imposing significant financial penalties on infringing marketing authorization holders.
 The United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020. Following the transition period which ended on December 31, 2020, Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom in the coming years.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
