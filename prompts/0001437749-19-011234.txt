Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division
 
Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division provides testing services, along with the manufacture and marketing of biological, chemical and cleaning indicators used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization processes, including steam, gas, hydrogen peroxide, ethylene oxide and radiation, in the hospital, dental, medical device and pharmaceutical industries.  Our biological indicators are developed and manufactured according to International Standards Organization (“ISO”) 11138 (Sterilization of health care products) under a quality system that complies with ISO 13485 (Medical devices) and 21 CFR 820 (Quality System Regulation). 
 
Biological indicators consist of resistant spores of certain microorganisms that are applied on a convenient substrate, such as a small piece of filter paper. The spores are well characterized in terms of purity, numbers and resistance to sterilization. In use, the biological indicator is exposed to a sterilization process and then tested to determine the presence of surviving organisms. Our biological indicators include (1) spore strips, which require post-processing transfer to a growth media, (2) self-contained products, which have the growth media already pre-packaged in crushable ampoules, (3) culture media, and (4) process challenge devices (“PCDs”) which increase the resistance of biological indicators, mimicking the packaging or other unique characteristics of a product being sterilized. Biological indicators are used to validate equipment and monitor the effectiveness of a process in any industrial or healthcare setting which uses sterilization. Key markets include healthcare, such as dental offices and hospitals, and industrial, such as medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
 
Our biological indicators are distinguished in the marketplace by their high level of quality, consistency and flexibility. A variety of different formats allows our biological indicators to be used in many different types of processes and products. For example, the simple spore strips are used most often in the small table-top steam sterilizers in dental offices, while a more complex self-contained biological indicator, either with or without a PCD, may be used by a medical device manufacturer to assure the sterility in a complex ethylene oxide sterilization process. In either case, the number of spores contained on the carrier and the resistance of the spores to the sterilization process must be well characterized in order to accurately assess the effectiveness of sterilization. During manufacturing, extensive quality control steps are used to ensure that the microorganism spores are well-characterized and their resistance is known following placement on the target carrier.
 
Chemical indicators use a chemical change (generally determined by color) to assess the exposure to sterilization conditions. Biological indicators and chemical indicators are often used together to monitor processes.
 
Cleaning indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of cleaning processes, including washer-disinfectors and ultrasonic cleaners in healthcare settings. Cleaning is the critical first step performed prior to disinfection and sterilization. Debris left on an instrument may interfere with microbial inactivation and can compromise the disinfection or sterilization process. Cleaning indicators compliment sterilization and disinfection processes within central sterile supply departments in hospitals.

Instruments Division
 
Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures and markets quality control instruments and disposable products used in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, medical device, food and beverage, industrial hygiene, and environmental air sampling industries.  Generally, our instrument products are used for testing, quality control, safety, validation and regulatory compliance.  Our Instruments Division products include:  (1) Data loggers, which are used in critical manufacturing and quality control processes in the pharmaceutical, medical device, food and tool industries; (2) Medical meters and calibration solutions, which are used for quality control in dialysis clinics and dialysis machine manufacturing operations; (3) Gas flow calibration and air sampling equipment, which are used for industrial hygiene monitoring, calibration of gas metering equipment and environmental air assessments by a variety of organizations, including metrology labs, manufacturing companies and government agencies; and 4) Torque testing systems, which are used to measure bottle cap tightness in the pharmaceutical and beverage industries. 
Data Loggers
 Our data logger products are self-contained, wireless, high precision instruments that are used in critical manufacturing, quality control and validation applications. They are used to measure temperature, humidity and pressure inside a process or a product during manufacturing. In addition, data loggers can be used to validate the proper operation of laboratory or manufacturing equipment, either during its installation or for annual re-certifications. The products consist of individual data loggers, a personal computer (“PC”) interface, software and various accessories. A customer typically purchases a large number of data loggers along with a single PC interface and the software package. In practice, using the PC interface, the user programs the loggers to collect environmental data at a pre-determined interval, places the data loggers in the product or process, and then collects stored process data from the data logger either through the PC interface or wirelessly via a radio link. The user can then prepare tabular and graphical reports using the software. Unique aspects of our data loggers are their ability to operate at elevated temperatures and in explosive environments – important differentiating factors in the marketplace and, consequently, they are used by companies to control their most critical processes, such as sterilization. Industries using the data loggers include pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and food processors.
Medical Meters and Calibration Solutions
 Our medical meters are used to test various parameters of the dialysis fluid (dialysate), and the proper calibration and operation of the dialysis machine. Each meter measures some combination of temperature, pressure, pH and conductivity to ensure that the dialysate has the proper composition to promote the transfer of waste products from the blood to the dialysate. The meters provide a digital readout that the patient, physician or technician uses to verify that the dialysis machine is working within prescribed limits and delivering properly prepared dialysate. We manufacture two styles of medical meters: those designed for use by dialysis machine manufacturers and biomedical technicians, and those used primarily by dialysis nurses. The meters for technicians are characterized by exceptional accuracy, stability and flexibility, and are used by the industry as the primary standard for the calibration of dialysis machines. The meters designed for use by dialysis nurses are known primarily for their ease of use and incorporate a previously patented, built-in syringe sampling system. These meters are used as the final quality control check on the dialysate just prior to starting a treatment. In addition to the dialysate meters, we market a line of standard solutions for use in dialysis clinics for calibration of our meters. These standard solutions are regularly consumed by the dialysis clinics; thus, along with calibration services, are less impacted by general economic conditions than instrument sales. Customers that utilize these products include dialysis facilities, medical device manufacturers, and biomedical service companies.
Gas Flow Calibration and Air Sampling Equipment
 We manufacture a variety of instruments and equipment for gas flow calibration and environmental air sampling. In the air sampling area, our technology is used primarily for the determination of particulate concentrations in air as a measure of urban or industrial air pollution, and for industrial hygiene assessments. The primary products include air samplers, particle separators and pumps. In the environmental area, our particle samplers were some of the first on the market and they were recognized early-on as “reference samplers” by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
 
We also manufacture gas flow calibration instruments to support the use of our air sampling equipment, and for broader industrial applications. Our gas flow calibration instruments provide the precise standards required by laboratories and industry in the design, development, manufacture, installation and calibration of various gas flow meters and air sampling devices. Our flow calibrators are used in many industries where professionals require the superior accuracy, reliability and ease of operation that they provide, including (1) industrial hygienists, (2) calibration and research laboratories, (3) manufacturers who design, develop and manufacture gas flow metering devices, and (4) industrial engineering and manufacturing companies that utilize gas flow metering devices.
 
Torque Testing Systems
 Our automated torque testing systems are durable and reliable motorized cap torque analyzers used throughout the packaging industry. The primary advantages of our torque instruments are their high accuracy and long-term consistency of measurement. Unlike manual torque testing instruments, our motorized torque systems eliminate the effects on the measurement results of different operators and different cap removal speeds. With a motorized torque testing system, the force applied to a cap is precisely the same in each testing cycle, regardless of who may be operating the machine, or how strong they may be. Our torque systems provide the information that helps the packaging operation track events, and potential problems during the manufacturing process so that corrections can be performed in a timely fashion. Industries utilizing these instruments include beverage, pharmaceutical, and food processing companies.

Cold Chain Monitoring Division
 
Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division designs, develops and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained. Cold chain monitoring systems are used in controlled environments such as refrigerators, freezers, warehouses, laboratory incubators, clean rooms and a number of other settings. The cold chain monitoring systems consist of wireless sensors that are placed in controlled environments, hardware modules to receive the wireless data, and various software programs to collect, store and process the data. Our systems are designed to operate continuously, providing data around the clock, 365 days per year. A critical function of our systems is the ability to provide local alarms and notifications via e-mail, text or telephone, in the case where established environmental conditions are exceeded. Key markets for our cold chain monitoring systems are hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies and laboratory environments.
 
Among the important competitive differentiators of our cold chain monitoring systems are (1) their high degree of reliability and up-time; (2) a large variety of sensor types (including our newly-acquired Point Six Wireless® brand) to meet the needs of most applications; (3) a skilled, distributed installation and service team; and (4) a full-featured and 21 CFR Part 11(Electronic records; Electronic signatures) validated software program, providing extensive reporting and alarm capability. An important aspect of our cold chain monitoring business is the ability to provide post-installation service and support. For most systems, annual re-calibration of each sensor is required, and we provide this service through our dedicated service organization
 
Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division also provides parameter (primarily temperature) monitoring of products during transport in a cold chain and consulting services such as compliance monitoring and validation or mapping of transport and storage containers. Our compliance services help customers validate the effectiveness of their cold chain and our monitoring systems record temperature during shipment and provide alarms in case of temperature excursions throughout a cold chain, from point of manufacture or collection, all the way to point of use.
 
Cold Chain Packaging Division
 
Our Cold Chain Packaging Division provides thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials and phase-change products to control temperature during transport.

Market Factors
 
Product sales are dependent on several factors, including general economic conditions, both domestic and international, customer capital spending trends, competition, introduction of new products, and acquisitions. Sterilization and Disinfection Control products and most products in our Cold Chain Packaging Division are disposable and are used on a routine basis, thus product sales are less sensitive to general economic conditions. Instrument products and Cold Chain Monitoring products and systems have a longer life, and their purchase by our customers is somewhat discretionary, so sales are more sensitive to general economic conditions. Service demand is driven by our customers’ quality control and regulatory environments, which require periodic repair and recalibration or certification of our instrument products and cold chain monitoring systems. We typically evaluate costs and pricing annually. Our policy is to price our products competitively and, where possible, we pass along cost increases in order to maintain our margins.
Manufacturing and Materials
 
We conduct product development, manufacturing and support of our Instruments Division products from our facilities in Lakewood, Colorado, Hanover Germany, and Butler, New Jersey.  Our instrument products are manufactured primarily by assembling the products from purchased components and calibrating the final products prior to release.  The manufacture and support of our Cold Chain Monitoring Division systems are conducted from our facility in Lakewood, Colorado and primarily involve assembling the systems from purchased components and calibrating the sensors, either at the factory or at the point of installation at the customer’s facility.  Our Point Six Wireless® brand sensors are manufactured by third party suppliers. Facilities in Bozeman, Montana, and Munich, Germany are used to manufacture the substantial majority of the Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division’s products, although one product line is manufactured in our Lakewood, Colorado facility.  Our biological indicator products are manufactured by growing microbiological spores from raw materials, forming the finished products and testing the finished biological indicators using established quality control tests.  Our dental sterilizer testing products are assembled into kits containing biological indicator spore strips and our microbiological laboratory tests these kits when they are returned to us to determine the effectiveness of our customer’s sterilization process.  Our cleaning indicator products are manufactured by inoculating a test soil onto a stainless-steel coupon.  The test soil is designed to mimic the challenge of removing blood and tissue from surgical instruments and evaluates the effectiveness of our customer’s cleaning process.  Our Cold Chain Packaging products are manufactured by third party suppliers.

Most of the materials and components used in our product lines are available from a number of different suppliers.  We generally maintain multiple sources of supply, but we are dependent on a single source for certain items.  We believe that in most cases, alternative sources could be developed, if required, for present single supply sources.  Although our dependence on these single supply sources may involve a degree of risk, to date we have been able to source sufficient stock to meet our production requirements. During the year ended March 31, 2019, we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on the business.

Government Regulation
 
While our quality system and manufacturing processes are generally the same throughout the Instruments Division, specific products are compliant under ISO 13485, ISO 17025, ISO 9001 and certain U.S. Federal regulations. Compliance requires us to obtain third party certification for certain products.
 
Several products in both the Instruments and Sterilization and Disinfection Control Divisions are medical devices subject to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”). The Act requires any company proposing to market a medical device to notify the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of its intention at least 90 days before doing so and in such notification must advise the FDA as to whether the device is substantially equivalent to a device marketed prior to May 28, 1976. We have received permission from the FDA to market all of our products requiring such permission.
 
Some of our facilities are subject to FDA regulations and inspections, which may be time-consuming and costly. This includes on-going compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations that require, among other things, the systematic control of manufacture, packaging and storage of products intended for human use. Failure to comply with these practices renders the product adulterated and could subject us to an interruption of manufacturing and selling these products, and possible regulatory action by the FDA.
 
The manufacture and sale of medical devices is also regulated by some states. Although there is substantial overlap between state regulations and the regulations of the FDA, some state laws may apply. We do not anticipate that complying with state regulations, however, will create any significant problems. Foreign countries also have laws regulating medical devices sold in those countries, which may cause us to expend additional resources on compliance.
 
We are also subject to anti-bribery laws in the U.S. and abroad, and to various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws.
 
Government Contracts
 
Although we transact business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on our financial results
Working Capital
 
We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items. In addition, our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.
Employees
 
On March 31, 2019, we had 347 employees, of which 167 are employed for manufacturing and quality assurance, 29 for research and development and engineering, 94 for sales and marketing, and 57 for administration.
