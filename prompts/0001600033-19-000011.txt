Item 1. Business.
Overview
e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (“e.l.f. Beauty” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” or “we”), which conducts business under the name e.l.f. Cosmetics, makes luxurious beauty accessible for all by offering high-quality, prestige-inspired cosmetic and skin care products at extraordinary value. Established in 2004 as an e-commerce business, the Company has become a multi-channel brand with strength across multiple channels. 

• | e-commerce. Our e-commerce business serves as a strong source of sales and an important component of our engagement and innovation model. We have nurtured a loyal, highly active online community for over a decade. Our foundation as an e-commerce company and our digital engagement model drive conversion on elfcosmetics.com, where we sell our full product offering. 


• | National retailers. We currently sell our products in the United States in the mass, drug store, food, and specialty retail channels. 


• | International. e.l.f. products are sold in a number of international markets, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico and Germany. 

Since 2014, we have made significant investments in our business by adding top talent and building our functional capabilities. We have developed strong consumer relationships through our differentiated engagement model; accelerated our first-to-mass innovation capability, including our first category adjacency in skin care; expanded our distribution; and significantly strengthened our operations.
Product
Our portfolio spans the eyes, lips, face, kits, tools and skin care categories. Our consumers recognize our ability to provide a broad assortment of high-quality, prestige-inspired products at an extraordinary value. We do not define ourselves as strictly mass or prestige or limit our product availability to select channels. The majority of our products retail for $6 or less, providing a low-risk way for consumers to try new products. From formulation to package design, our products deliver quality and innovation at a fraction of prestige prices, encouraging frequent consumer purchasing and experimentation without the guilt of overspending.
All e.l.f. products are hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic and vegan and do not contain any animal-derived ingredients. We do not test on animals or endorse such practices, nor do we use ingredients that are tested on animals. We 
have been designated as a “cruelty-free” company by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Our products are also free from parabens, phthalates, microbeads, and sulfates.
Marketing
The Company has deployed a low-cost, consumer-centric marketing model. Total expenses for advertising and promotions in the year ended December 31, 2018 were $10.2 million, approximately 4% of our net sales.
Our consumers have been our best advocates, growing the e.l.f. brand virally through strong word of mouth. Many are very active in social media, write reviews of our products online and generate content on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media outlets. Over 31 million people visited our e-commerce websites and/or followed us on social media in 2018. Our e-commerce websites reflect our passionate consumer base with approximately 136,000 ratings. Our digital content inspires our fans with looks and products they love and avoids common industry messaging that beauty is about perfection.
Relative to the overall cosmetics category, our brand over-indexes with Millennials, multi-cultural consumers and some of the heaviest users in the category. This attractive and loyal consumer base supports high sales per linear foot and high category sales for our retail customers.
Innovation
We believe innovation is key to our success and that we are a leader in the industry in speed and new product introductions. We leverage multiple sources of inspiration to develop our new product ideas, including global trend assessments, supplier and industry research, strategic customer input and consumer feedback and insights. Our innovation strategy is underpinned by three key pillars to delight consumers:

• | First-to-mass. “First-to-mass” products are inspired by trends in prestige beauty that we bring to the mass market. As consumers are increasingly savvy and knowledgeable about trends in the prestige market, they look for how they can achieve on-trend looks, but at an accessible price. Examples include the e.l.f. Mineral Infused Face Primer at $6 versus a prestige primer at $36, e.l.f. Poreless Putty Primer at $8 versus a prestige primer at $52, the e.l.f. Beauty Shield Magnetic Mask at $24 versus a similar type of mask at $75, and the e.l.f. 16HR Camo Concealer at $5 versus a similar type of concealer at $27. 


• | Core expansion. Core expansion products are those trend-inspired products across eyes, lips, face and tools that augment our assortment and deliver extraordinary value across price points. We consistently evaluate our core offerings and develop new products based on category trends, consumer feedback, and other market intelligence. 


• | Adjacencies. We believe that we can reapply our model to launch products into adjacent categories. For example, we entered the skin care category in 2015 with a high-quality skin care product assortment. 

We leverage insights gained from each channel to drive performance across the business. Our direct channel enables us to analyze sales results, reviews, and feedback through social media to provide a quick indication of a product’s performance. We use this valuable data to introduce validated, best-selling products to retail, which drives leading performance relative to others in the category.
Unlike many beauty companies that launch products in concert with the timing of when retailers rearrange or restock products, we leverage our multi-channel model to launch products throughout the year and test in our direct channel.
Markets and competition
The cosmetics category primarily consists of face makeup, eye makeup, lip products, nail products and cosmetics sets/kits and excludes beauty tools and accessories such as brushes and applicators. Cosmetics are broadly sold through food, drug and mass channels, as well as through department stores and direct and specialty channels. The cosmetics industry is relatively concentrated, with a significant portion of cosmetics retail sales in the United States generated by brands owned by a few large multinational companies, such as L’Oreal, Estee Lauder, Revlon, Coty and Shiseido. These large multinational companies own many brands across mass and prestige cosmetics and e.l.f. is one of a small number of brands that is independent. In addition to the traditional brands against which we compete, small independent companies continue to enter the market with new brands and customized product offerings.

Customers
Walmart and Target accounted for 30% and 21%, respectively, of our net sales in 2018. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's net sales in 2018. The Company expects that Walmart and Target and a small number of other customers will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of the Company's net sales in the future. 
As is customary in the industry, none of the Company’s customers is under an obligation to continue purchasing products from the Company in the future.
For more information regarding customer concentration see Item 7 “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “Overview.”
Operations
We have developed a scalable, asset-light supply chain centered on speed to market and high-quality at low cost. Our China-based sourcing, quality and innovation teams work with their U.S.-based counterparts to deliver ongoing product quality, innovation and cost savings.
Manufacturing process
Our manufacturing process centers on close collaboration with a network of third-party manufacturers in China and, more recently, the United States. We believe what differentiates us is our ability to drive speed, quality and efficient production. We leverage high annual unit volumes with our suppliers to have them quickly produce small quantities of a new product so that we can launch online in as few as 13 weeks from concept and 20 weeks on average. These early sales provide us with validation data to determine which products to introduce at our national retail customers. Based on what we decide to scale up, we believe we can provide higher, more reliable, longer-term volumes to our manufacturers.
We have improved our internal team and supply network to drive even higher quality, while keeping our flexible and low-cost structure. We have ample manufacturing capacity as well as redundant capability in the event that one or more suppliers cannot meet our needs. Our broad supply base gives us the ability to fulfill our product requirements and remain cost competitive.
Ingredients and packaging
We work closely with our suppliers on new product innovation and quality. Our innovation team creates our formulas and our suppliers produce to our specifications. We are not overly dependent on any single formula raw material. These raw materials are broadly available and have regular quality testing for ingredient integrity.
Our team members create our component and secondary packaging specifications and source their production. We have multiple component and packaging suppliers in place with ample back-up capacity. Our co-packers purchase from our packaging suppliers at our pre-negotiated specifications and rates. This allows us to efficiently manage our packaging quality, capacity and cost.
Quality control
We have a comprehensive quality assurance program that gives us visibility into the quality of our products during the sourcing and production cycle. Our innovation team approves product samples and is on-site for initial production runs of new products. Our quality team provides oversight through on-site inspections and audits of our third-party manufacturers as well as component and packaging suppliers. We periodically conduct comprehensive audits of all our suppliers and have an on-site scheduled presence at our primary suppliers, where we inspect and monitor finished and semi-finished product, raw materials, batch records and testing records. We also validate our manufacturers’ finished product testing results with third-party laboratory testing. In the spirit of continual improvement, we have frequent dialogue with our suppliers on quality assurance enhancements.
Warehousing, distribution and logistics
We opened a new distribution center in Columbus, Ohio in 2018 to expand our e-commerce distribution capabilities. In conjunction with our existing distribution center in Ontario, California, this new facility supports multi-channel shipping, with the ability to pick and ship directly to e-commerce consumers, national retail customers and international

customers. We have also invested capital in picking, packaging, scanning, and conveying technology to more fully automate our processes. Our Ontario facility and our Columbus facility are both operated by a leading third-party logistics provider. Additionally, we utilize third-party logistics providers in Canada and the United Kingdom to distribute to certain international customers.
Seasonality
Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the third and fourth calendar quarters typically being higher than in the first and second calendar quarters. The higher net sales in the third and fourth calendar quarters are largely attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday season, and adverse events that occur during the third or fourth calendar quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. As a result of higher sales during the third and fourth calendar quarters, we are required to make investments in working capital during the second and third calendar quarters. For more information regarding our working capital requirements see Item 7 “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources.” Fluctuations throughout the year are also driven by the timing of product restocking or rearrangement by our major customers as well as our expansion into new customers. 
Trademarks and other intellectual property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademarks include “e.l.f.,” “eyes lips face” and “play beautifully,” all of which are registered in the United States with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our goods and services of primary interest. These trademarks are also registered or have registrations pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Mexico, Russia and approximately 25 other countries or registries. We also have numerous other trademark registrations and pending applications for product names and tag lines. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand and our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. The current registrations of these trademarks in the United States and foreign countries are effective for consecutive terms of 10 to 15 years and are due for periodic renewals, presently scheduled between 2019 and 2032, provided that we comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of trademarks in connection with the listed goods or services. In addition to trademark protection, we own four U.S. Design Patents covering make-up tools and brush handle shapes with expiration dates in 2026, 2032, 2033, and 2034 and we own numerous domain names, including our e-commerce websites (www.elfcosmetics.com and www.elfcosmetics.co.uk). We also rely on and use reasonable business activities to protect unpatented proprietary expertise and product formulations, continuing innovation and other know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 277 full-time employees and 137 part-time and seasonal employees. As of December 31, 2018, we had 206 and 71 full-time employees in the United States and China, respectively. The majority of our part-time employees in 2018 worked in our e.l.f. stores. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Government regulation
We and our products are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations, including regulation in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”). These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients, proper labeling, advertising (including the use of 3rd party influencers), packaging, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of our products. Further, as the vast majority of our products are imported from overseas manufacturers, we are subject to Customs Border Patrol clearance regulations prior to goods being released into the US market.
We are also subject to a number of federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including regulations related to consumer protection, the promotion and sale of merchandise, privacy, use and protection of consumer and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), behavioral tracking, and advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways).

Additional laws in all these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we operate and may significantly increase our compliance costs. For information regarding the risks related to the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see Item 1A “Risk factors”.
Expenditures for environmental compliance
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
Segments
We operate our business as a single operating and reportable segment. For more information regarding segment reporting, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 “Exhibits, financial statement schedules” under the heading “Segment reporting.”
Geographic information
For information regarding the geographic source of our net sales and the location of our long-lived assets, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 “Exhibits, financial statement schedules” under the heading “Segment reporting.” For information regarding the risks related to our non-U.S. operations, see Item 1A “Risk factors.”
