ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 
Freshpet, Inc. (“Freshpet,” the “Company,” "we" or "our") is disrupting the over $38.4 billion North American pet food industry by driving consumers to reassess conventional dog and cat food offerings that have remained essentially unchanged for decades. We position our brand to benefit from mainstream trends of growing pet humanization and consumer focus on health and wellness. We price our products to be accessible to the average consumer, providing us with broad demographic appeal and allowing us to penetrate multiple classes of retail, including grocery (including online), mass, club, pet specialty and natural. We have successfully expanded our network of Freshpet Fridges within leading blue-chip retail chains. The strength of our business model extends to our customers, who we believe find that Freshpet grows their pet category sales, drives higher traffic, increases shopper frequency and delivers category leading margins. As of December 31, 2022, our household penetration within North America was approximately 4.9 million, with a target of 11 million households by 2025. Additionally, we believe that there are opportunities to expand our network into international markets as demonstrated with our recent initiatives in the U.K. market.
Our Industry 
 
We primarily compete in the North American dog and cat food market, which we estimate will grow at an average compounded annual growth rate of 5.7% from 2022 to 2027. We believe pet food spending in North America will continue to increase at a similar rate during this same time period. The pet food market has historically been resilient as consumers continue to spend on their pets even during economic downturns.
 
We believe the following trends are driving growth in our industry:
 
Pet ownership.    There are currently approximately 90.5 million pet owning households in the United States, which represents approximately 70% of total households, and over 114.3 million dogs and cats in the United States, according to the American Pet Products Association.
 
Pet humanization.    According to Packaged Facts, 92%-96% of U.S. pet owners view their pets as members of the family. As pets are increasingly viewed as companions, friends and family members, pet owners are being transformed into “pet parents” who spare no expense for their loved ones, driving premiumization across pet categories. This trend is reflected in food purchasing decisions. According to an American Pet Products Association's Pulse Study, 72% of pet parents feel they are closer/more bonded with their pet due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that pet owners' closer bond to their pets aligns with recent trends, which the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated. 
 
Increasing consumer focus on health & wellness.   Consumers are increasingly purchasing fresh, natural and organic food products. We believe consumers are seeking simple, fresh and easy to understand food products from brands they trust and made with ingredients that are transparently sourced.
 
The pet food purchasing decision is underpinned by higher brand loyalty than many other consumer packaged goods categories. A consumer selecting a pet food brand resists frequent switching in order to avoid disrupting the pet’s diet, resulting in high repeat purchasing behavior. As a result, we believe that as consumers try fresh, refrigerated pet food, they are likely to become repeat users of the product.
 
Our Opportunity 
 
Even though long-term consumer trends of pet humanization and health and wellness are well documented, conventional pet food sold as dry kibble or wet food in cans has not changed substantially for decades. We believe that the pet food industry has not kept pace with how consumers think about food for their families, including their pets. As a result, consumers are searching for higher quality, less processed food for their dogs’ and cats’ meals that measure up to today’s sensibilities of what actually constitutes “good food.” Freshpet was specifically designed to address this growing need with affordable offerings accessible to the average consumer.

Our Mission and Values 
 
We started Freshpet with a single-minded mission—to bring the power of real, fresh food to our dogs and cats. And, we are committed to doing so in ways that are good for Pets, People and Planet.
Pets 
 
Our pets are members of our family and deserve to eat the kind of fresh, healthy food that we do. Freshpet's carefully selected ingredients and gentle cooking process ensures best-in-class bioavailable nutrition. Hundreds of customer testimonials each year underscore Freshpet's support of a long and healthy life. Further, since founding Freshpet, we have donated over fourteen million fresh meals to pets via shelters, charitable organizations, and humane societies, including St Hubert's Animal Welfare Center, Pennsylvania SPCA and 4 Paws for Ability. 
People 
 
People include our team members, pet parents, and our partners. We treat our team members with respect and are committed to helping them develop professionally and personally. These efforts have contributed to an employee net promoter score of 80.0%. Additionally, we strive to be good partners with customers, distributors, and suppliers by conducting business with honesty and transparency knowing that we cannot grow without their support.
Planet
 
We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact while providing the healthiest, tastiest pet food possible. Freshpet Kitchens Bethlehem is a landfill-free facility thanks to state-of-the-art recycling, digesting, and waste-to-energy processes. We support renewable energy by matching the electricity used in Freshpet Kitchens Bethlehem and our refrigerators in over 25,000 retail locations with Green-E Certified renewable energy certificates from North American based projects. Freshpet's chiller fleet efficiency continues to improve with our latest units being up to 8.5x more efficient than older units. In 2020, Nature's Fresh became Freshpet's first, and one of the industry's only, carbon neutral brand for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. For 2021, we went even further and made Freshpet's entire business carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We are committed to reducing as much of our carbon emissions as possible and use offsets to mitigate residual emissions. In 2022 we opened our state-of-the-art Kitchens in Ennis, TX. This facility will be our most sustainable yet with on-site solar power and battery micro-grid, wastewater recycling, and our most advanced heating / cooling technology. These efforts are intended to help achieve our environmental goals, building and preserving a healthy planet for generations to come. 
 
Our commitment to our values helps us engage with consumers, motivate our team members and attract strong partners, which allows us to fulfill our mission of delivering the best nutritional product choices to improve the well-being of our pets, enrich pet parents’ lives and contribute to communities. Freshpet—Pets, People, Planet.

Our Products 
 
Freshpet's business operates in a single segment: the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of pet food and pet treats for dogs and cats. Our products consist of dog food, cat food and dog treats. All Freshpet products are made according to our nutritional philosophy of fresh, meat-based nutrition and minimal processing. Our proprietary recipes include real, fresh meat and varying combinations of vitamin-rich vegetables, leafy greens and antioxidant rich fruits, without the use of preservatives, additives or artificial ingredients. Our unique product attributes appeal to diverse consumer needs across multiple classes of retail where Freshpet is sold. Consequently, our brand resonates across a broad cross-section of pet parent demographics.
 
Our products are sold under the Freshpet brand name, with ingredients, packaging and labeling customized by different classes of trade and are available in multiple forms.
 

We also offer fresh treats across all classes of retail under the Dognation and Dog Joy labels.

Our Product Innovation 
 
As the first manufacturer of fresh, refrigerated pet food distributed across North America, product innovation is core to our strategy. We take a fresh approach to pet food and are not constrained by conventional pet food products, attributes and production capabilities. We employ a tightly-knit, creative team of marketing and research and development professionals, and we consult with outside experts through our Nutrition Council, which consist of PhDs in nutrition and veterinary nutritionists. Our team often identifies pet parents’ needs by evaluating emerging demand trends in both pet food and human food. New products are refined iteratively with the help of consumer panel data to arrive at products that we believe can be commercially successful.
 
The success of our approach is evidenced by our broad product portfolio today. We began Freshpet by producing fresh, refrigerated slice and serve rolls, and over time have steadily expanded into successful new product forms including bags and treats. We also introduced new fresh recipes and ingredients, such as proteins and grain-free options never before seen in pet food that cater to the specific dietary requirements of pets.
 
Our Innovation Center, which is part of our Freshpet Kitchens, helps us ensure that we remain capable of strong innovation including creating new product platforms to expand the breadth of our fresh pet food offerings. We expect that new product introductions and the introduction of new cooking techniques will continue to delight our consumers and drive growth going forward.
 
Our Supply Chain 
 
Manufacturing: All of our products are manufactured in the United States. We own and operate what we believe to be the first fresh, refrigerated pet food manufacturing network in North America. Our original Freshpet Kitchens Bethlehem is a 240,000 square foot facility, built to United States Department of Agriculture standards and currently houses six production lines customized to produce fresh, refrigerated food. 
 
In 2020 we began making investments at a manufacturing facility titled "Freshpet Kitchens South." Freshpet Kitchens South currently has three production lines with the space for additional production lines in the future. 
 
The construction of Freshpet Kitchens Ennis, located in Ennis, Texas, began in 2020, with the first production line having been commissioned in Q4 of 2022, and two more lines to be commissioned over the next 18 months from the first phase of the project. The project is being developed in three phases with subsequent expansion planned for the next several years.
 
Due to the continued growth of the Company’s fresh pet food sales, the Company has plans to continue expanding its manufacturing capacity via operational efficiency improvements at our current facilities and via future expansion of our physical features.
 
In 2022, approximately 98.8% of our product volume was manufactured with Freshpet owned equipment.
 
Ingredients and Packaging: Our products are made with natural and fresh ingredients including meat, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, vitamins and minerals. Over 50% of our raw ingredients are sourced from suppliers located within 300 miles of our Freshpet Kitchens, and 96% are from North America. We maintain rigorous standards for ingredient quality and safety. By volume, our single largest input is fresh chicken. In order to retain operating flexibility and negotiating leverage, we do not enter into exclusivity agreements or long-term commitments with any of our suppliers. All of our suppliers are well-established companies that have the scale to support our growth. For every ingredient, we either use multiple suppliers or have identified alternative sources of supply that meet our quality and safety standards.
Distribution: Outbound transportation from our facility is handled through a third-party refrigerated freight broker. During 2022 we began to leverage a second third-party distribution center in Texas with the expectation that the Texas facility will service the western section of the country and the Pennsylvania distribution center will service the eastern section of the country. As volume grows we expect to leverage our distribution network to continuously improve customer service levels and decrease certain distribution costs. For certain retailers, we use national and regional distributors.

Our Product Quality and Safety 
 
We go to great lengths to ensure product quality, consistency and safety from ingredient sourcing to finished product. Our Freshpet-owned manufacturing lines allows us to exercise significant control over production. We have a highly skilled Quality Assurance team consisting of quality assurance supervisors, specialists, analysts and quality technicians with significant experience in pet and human food production.
 
Our production processes are designed to meet science-based quality standards with documented plans for Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points and Hazard Analysis Risk Based Preventive Control to monitor established production controls, calibrate instruments, record data and perform corrective actions. Our on-site laboratory has microbial and composition testing capabilities. Quality control approvals are based on a positive release strategy, wherein a batch can only be shipped when it passes control point record reviews and laboratory testing. Before commencing production, quality assurance professionals swab equipment to test for potential contaminants.
 
Freshpet’s food safety program is certified at Safe Quality Food Level III, which is the highest standard determined under the Global Food Safety Initiative Benchmarks. We believe our systems and standards for product quality and safety can support our growth and ensure continued success in the market.
 
Our Customers and Distributors 
 
We sell our products throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe, generating the vast majority of our sales in the United States. The strength of our business model makes us an attractive partner for leading blue-chip retailers, who we believe find that Freshpet grows the sales of their pet category, drives higher traffic, increases shopper frequency and delivers category-leading margins. Our Freshpet Fridge locations have been consistently increasing as we add new retail accounts and add stores in existing accounts. We are in approximately 25,281 stores and believe there is opportunity for us to install a Freshpet Fridge in at least 30,000 stores in North America. We sell our products through the following classes of retail: grocery (including online), mass, club, pet specialty and natural.
 
Our customers determine whether they wish to purchase our products either directly from us or through a third-party distributor. In 2022, our largest distributor by net sales, Animal Supply Co., accounted for 8.0% of our net sales and our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 21.4% of our net sales.

The Freshpet Fridge 
 
We sell our products through a growing network of company-owned branded refrigerators, the Freshpet Fridges. Our Freshpet Fridges are typically four feet wide by seven feet high and replace standard shelving in the pet aisle or an end-cap of a retail store. Our Freshpet Fridge designs are constantly evolving with all new models featuring prominent edge-lit LED headers, LED interior lighting, crisp black interiors and frameless glass swing doors for aesthetics and easy access. We use state-of-the-art refrigeration technology and environmentally friendly refrigerants to minimize energy consumption and environmental impact.
 
We design and produce the Freshpet Fridge through a combination of in-house resources and world-class partners. We source our Freshpet Fridges from leading global commercial refrigerator manufacturers with whom we have a collaborative approach to refrigerator design and innovation. Once ordered by us, Freshpet Fridges are shipped to distribution centers for delivery and installation in retail stores.
 
Installation into retail locations and ongoing maintenance of the Freshpet Fridge is coordinated by Freshpet and executed through leading third-party service providers. All of our Freshpet Fridges are protected by a manufacturer warranty of three years. Our refrigerators are designed to be highly reliable, and at any given time less than 0.5% of the network is out of service for maintenance. Moreover, to ensure quality, cleanliness and appropriate in-stock levels, we employ brokerage partners to conduct a physical audit of the Freshpet Fridge network on an ongoing basis, with photographic results of our Freshpet Fridges transmitted back to Freshpet for review by members of our sales team.
 
We currently estimate less than 12 month cash-on-cash payback for the average Freshpet Fridge installation, calculated by comparing our total current costs for a refrigerator (including installation) to our current margin on net revenues. We believe our attractive value proposition to retailers and pet parents will allow us to continue penetrating store locations of existing and new customers. The Freshpet Fridge provides a highly-visible merchandising platform, allowing us to control how our brand is presented to consumers at point-of-sale and represents a significant point of differentiation from other pet food competitors. Our total chiller fleet at retailers covers over one million cubic feet of space.

Marketing and Advertising 
 
Our marketing strategy is designed to educate consumers about the benefits of fresh refrigerated pet food and build awareness of the Freshpet brand. We deploy a broad set of marketing tools across television, digital and public relations to reach consumers through multiple touch points and increase product trials.
 
Our network of fridges at approximately 25,281 retail locations within blue-chip retailers helps to introduce consumers to our brand and instantly distinguish Freshpet from traditionally merchandised pet food. We have effectively used national TV advertising to drive incremental consumers to try Freshpet products. We expect to realize greater benefits from national TV advertising as we continue to grow the network of Freshpet store locations nationwide. We have also expanded our online presence to better target consumers seeking information on healthy pet food. We reach consumers across multiple digital and social media platforms including websites, blogs and online reviews, as well as with tailored messaging on popular digital hubs including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube. 
 
Our marketing strategy has allowed us to drive new consumers to our brand and develop a highly engaged community of users who actively advocate for Freshpet.
 
Competition 
 
Pet food is a highly competitive industry. We compete with manufacturers of conventional pet food such as Mars, Nestlé and Big Heart Pet Brands (part of The J.M. Smucker Company). We also compete with specialty and natural pet food manufacturers such as Colgate-Palmolive and General Mills. In addition, we compete with many regional niche brands in individual geographic markets, as well as the launch of new direct-to-consumer frozen brands.
 
Given a North American retail landscape dominated by large retailers, with limited shelf space and a significant number of competing products, competitors actively support their brands through marketing, advertising, promotional spending and discounting.
 
Competitive factors in the pet food industry include product quality, ingredients, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety, product packaging and design, reputation, price, advertising, promotion and nutritional claims. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.

At Freshpet we always want to build a fair, healthy and safe workplace, while creating work environment policies that promote diversity, equality and inclusion for our valued employees.

We are proud of our focus on promoting employee engagement across our operations - from our supply chain to our products - and are committed to building our business on a foundation of strong ethics.
