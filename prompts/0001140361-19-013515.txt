Our Business
 
Janel Corporation (“Janel,” the “Company,” or the “Registrant”) is a holding company with subsidiaries in two business segments: Global Logistics Services and Manufacturing. Janel strives to create shareholder value primarily through three strategic priorities:

• | supporting its businesses’ efforts to make investments and to build long-term profits;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | allocating Janel’s capital at high risk-adjusted rates of return; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attracting and retaining exceptional talent.
--+---------------------------------------------


 
 The Company’s Global Logistics Services segment, comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively known as “Janel Group,” provides customs brokerage and non-asset-based transportation services. The Company’s Manufacturing segment is comprised of two manufacturing businesses in mixing equipment and life sciences. Janel was incorporated on August 31, 2000 and is domiciled in the state of Nevada.  Its corporate headquarters are located in Lynbrook, New York.

 
 A management group at the holding company level (the “corporate group”) focuses on significant capital allocation decisions, corporate governance and supporting Janel’s subsidiaries where appropriate. Janel expects to grow through its subsidiaries’ organic growth and by completing acquisitions. We plan to either acquire businesses within our existing segments or expand our portfolio into new strategic segments. Our acquisition strategy focuses on reasonably-priced companies with strong and capable management teams, attractive existing business economics and stable and predictable earnings power.
 
Janel and its consolidated subsidiaries employ 172 full-time and four part-time people in the United States. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Janel and its subsidiaries have experienced no work stoppages and consider relations with their employees to be good.

 Our Business Segments
 
We have two reportable segments: Global Logistics Services and Manufacturing.
 
 
 
 Global Logistics Services
      The Company’s Global Logistics Services segment is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively known as “Janel Group.” Janel Group is a non-asset based, full-service provider of cargo transportation logistics management services, including freight forwarding via air-, ocean- and land-based carriers, customs brokerage services, warehousing and distribution services, and other value-added logistics services.

 
Janel Group helps its clients move and manage freight efficiently to reduce inventories and to increase supply chain speed and reliability. Key services include customs entry filing, arrangement of freight forwarding by air, ocean and ground, warehousing, cargo insurance procurement, logistics planning, product repackaging and online shipment tracking.

 
 Janel Group earns flat fees for certain services, such as customs entry filing. For brokered services, Janel Group earns the difference between the rate charged by a service provider and the rate Janel Group charges the customer for the provider’s service. Janel Group’s freight consolidation activities, in addition to on-going volume-based relationships with providers, allows Janel Group to command preferred service rates that can be passed on profitably to the customer.

 
 Our Global Logistics Services revenue is greatly influenced by the price of transportation services and other items such as fuel prices. We and others in the industry, therefore, tend to track net revenue calculated as total revenues less the cost of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale. We consider net revenue to be our primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues.
 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, Janel Group handled approximately 53,000 individual import and export shipments originating or terminating in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Approximately 38% of the “gross” revenue from these activities related to ocean import/export, 24% to air import/export, 16% to customs brokerage and the remainder to ground and other freight forwarding services. Janel Group had no customers that accounted for more than 10% of Janel Corporation’s total revenue in fiscal 2018.

 
 Based upon net revenue, our customers are diverse with the largest individual customer accounting for about 3% of net revenue and the top ten customers accounting for 23% of net revenue during fiscal 2018. For our service offerings by net revenues, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, 49% related to customs brokerage entries, 16% to ocean freight, 15% to air freight and 20% to domestic transportation.
 
Janel Group operates out of eleven leased, full-service locations in the United States: Lynbrook (New York), New York (headquarters, operations and accounting); Boston, Massachusetts; Pawtucket (Providence), Rhode Island; Edison (Newark), New Jersey; Essington (Philadelphia), Pennsylvania; Forest Park (Atlanta), Georgia; Elk Grove Village (Chicago), Illinois; Tucson, Arizona; Torrance (Los Angeles), California; Daly City (San Francisco), California; and Portland, Oregon. Janel Group maintains a network of independent agent relationships in many trading countries, giving it the ability to provide a global service to its clients.

      Each office is responsible for its growth and profitability. The Janel Group leadership helps the offices as needed with efforts such as hiring new people, maintaining a common information technology platform and centralized accounting services. Our growth strategy includes servicing existing customers well and winning more of their business, hiring new people that can grow our company, and adding new companies or services through acquisitions. Our goal is to maintain a high-quality service network that shares one brand connected with a common information technology platform.

      The logistics industry is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry and intense competition. Janel Group competes against providers ranging in size from “mom-and-pop” businesses to multi-national firms with hundreds of offices worldwide. Many Janel Group customers utilize more than one logistics provider.

      The global forwarding industry requires dealings in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. As a result, Janel Group is exposed to the inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental interference. Some countries in which Janel Group maintains agent relationships have currency control regulations that influence Janel Group’s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure. Janel Group tries to manage these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among those agents.

      Historically, Janel Group’s quarterly operating results have been subject to seasonal trends. The fiscal third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest, and the fiscal second quarter has traditionally been the weakest. This pattern has been the result of, or influenced by, numerous factors including climate, national holidays, consumer demand, economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces.

 A significant portion of Janel Group’s revenues are derived from customers in industries with shipping patterns tied to consumer demand and/or just-in-time production schedules. Many of Janel Group’s customers may ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter. Therefore, the timing of Janel Group revenues is, to a large degree, affected by factors beyond its control, such as shifting consumer demand for retail goods and manufacturing production delays. Janel Group cannot accurately forecast many of these factors, nor can it estimate the relative impact of any given factor. Therefore, historical patterns experienced may not continue in the future.

 
 Government Regulation

 
 Interstate and international transportation of freight is highly regulated. Failure to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, or to maintain required permits or licenses, can result in substantial fines or revocation of operating permits or authorities imposed on both transportation intermediaries and their shipper customers. We cannot give assurance as to the degree or cost of future regulations on our business.

 
 Janel Group is a customs broker licensed and permitted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). All U.S. customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP. Janel Group is a registered Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) and is licensed as a non-vessel operating common carrier (“NVOCC”) by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). The FMC has established certain qualifications for shipping agents, including certain surety bonding requirements. We also operate as a Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) certified Indirect Air Carrier (“IAC”), providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration.

 
 Risk Management and Insurance

 
 As a property freight broker, we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers’ cargo. In our customer contracts, we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum. We typically do not assume cargo liability above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding, ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments. With regards to international freight forwarding, ocean transportation and international domestic air freight shipments, we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers’ interest coverage to insure goods in transit. When we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms, we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage.

 
 We maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier. We also carry various liability insurance policies, including automobile and general liability, with an umbrella policy.

      Manufacturing

      The Company’s Manufacturing segment is comprised of Indco, Inc. (“Indco”), Aves and Antibodies. Janel established the Manufacturing segment in 2016 with its acquisition of Indco and expanded the segment with two manufacturing businesses in 2018 through the acquisitions of Aves and Antibodies.
Mixing Equipment

 
 Indco, which is a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, manufactures and distributes mixing equipment and apparatus for specific applications within various industries. Indco’s headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in a single leased facility in New Albany, Indiana.

      Indco provides solutions for the mixing needs of customers operating in diverse industries, including chemicals, inks, paints, construction, plastics, adhesives, cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals. Solutions include over 2,500 standard product configurations, both manufactured and distributed, available for order from Indco’s website and its print catalog, mailed quarterly. In addition, Indco manufactures custom-designed mixing solutions that Indco helps specify, design, machine, assemble and distribute. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, Indco made approximately 5,800 individual shipments to customers. In fiscal 2018, approximately 82% of Indco’s revenue came from manufacturing activity. The remainder of its revenue came from non-manufactured product distribution activity. Indco’s revenue generally is level throughout the year with little seasonality.

 
 Indco relies on a variety of providers of raw materials, mechanical components and other services in order to manufacture its products. These providers include national and multi-national suppliers for common industrial components such as motors, gear drives, motor controls and many other standard hardware products. Additionally, regional and local suppliers provide Indco-specific parts such as castings and fabricated metal components. Raw materials, primarily steel bar, plate and shafts are sourced from domestic steel mills through local distributors. Alternative or substantially similar options are available from suppliers other than those Indco currently employs. While custom cast or fabricated parts are at greater risk for supply interruption, alternative equivalent suppliers are typically available.

 Our growth strategy within the industrial mixer business is to expand our reputation as a high-quality manufacturer of often customized products to meet specialized mixing needs. Indco’s products are often utilized in mission-critical applications, making our high quality and strong service offering highly valuable to our customers. Our growth strategy includes keeping our direct relationship with the customer relevant through our web presence, introducing new relevant products and expanding our reach into new and existing markets with sales efforts and partners.

 
 The industrial mixer manufacturing industry is highly fragmented with low barriers to entry. Indco competes with companies of all sizes based on a combination of pricing, lead-times, service, quality and ability to reach customers through internet presence and catalog circulation.

      Government regulation directly governing Indco’s industrial mixer product line is minimal. Changing energy efficiency standards, however, as mandated by the Department of Energy, can, over time, affect electric motor manufacturers whose products are used by Indco.  Historically, these changes have resulted in only minor changes to our product line.

      Indco is subject to U.S. federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment. Although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws, the Company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on Indco. Indco does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during the remainder of the current or succeeding fiscal years.

 
 Life Sciences

 
 The Company’s wholly-owned life science subsidiaries consist of Antibodies and Aves. Aves is a manufacturer and distributor of high-quality antibodies and other immunoreagents for biomedical research and diagnostics. Antibodies is a manufacturer and distributor of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, diagnostic reagents and diagnostic kits and a developer and practitioner of immunoassays for academic and industry research scientists. Through a combined portfolio of approximately 900 products and a range of custom services, Aves and Antibodies provide the scientific community with high quality tools to support critical research efforts.

 
 Our life sciences business is based in Davis, California on its owned 40-acre facility.

 
 Our growth strategy is to place high-quality products in the hands of more researchers to accelerate scientific discovery. Our strategies include:

 
   
• | Product innovation: By working with key researchers and scientific organizations, we seek to develop new products to enhance the range of tools available and thereby expand the capabilities of life science researchers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operational improvement: We continue to enhance our operational designs and processes to be more efficient, which supports higher profitability and enables us to devote more resources to investments in growth and innovation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attract and retain exceptional talent: High quality scientists enable our top-quality products and services to be offered which are key to our reputation in the market place. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquisitions and investments: We intend to grow by acquiring new businesses with high quality reputations that will benefit from our combined innovation and operational strength. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customers and distribution methods: We sell our biotechnology products directly to customers, principally direct through our website or distributors. Some of our customers utilize our scientific expertise and production capabilities and purchase our products and re-label them. Our reputation for quality products is critical to our ability to attract new customers for both our products and services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitors: A number of companies supply protein-related research and diagnostic reagents. Customers choose their products based upon product quality, reputation and price. We believe a number of our products have long standing reputations and that our portfolio overall is well regarded, especially amongst the academic, diagnostic and pharmaceutical research community. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Manufacturing: We manufacture our products at one location in Davis, California. Our antibodies are produced using a variety of technologies including traditional animal immunization and hybridoma technology as well as recombinant antibody techniques. We are not dependent on key or sole source suppliers for most of our products as we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 The majority of our life science products are shipped within two days of receipt of the customers’ orders. Consequently, we typically do not maintain significant backlog of orders for our life science segment products.
 
Our life science business is subject to regulation. Antibodies maintains International Organization of Standardization certification for medical devices to support our manufacturing operation. We also comply with regulations related to the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institutes of Health, Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare and the United States Food and Drug Administration. Many on our customers are regulated and must verify our compliance with their standards throughout the supply chain which requires us to maintain careful records. The failure to comply with these regulations may impair our ability to compete in the marketplace.
