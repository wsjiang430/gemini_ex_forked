Item 1. Business
General
Group 1 Automotive, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1995, is a leading operator in the automotive retail industry. As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 238 franchises, representing 30 brands of automobiles, at 183 dealership locations and 47 collision centers worldwide. We own 152 franchises at 118 dealership locations and 29 collision centers in the United States of America (“U.S.”), 63 franchises at 47 dealership locations and 11 collision centers in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and 23 franchises at 18 dealership locations and seven collision centers in Brazil. Through our dealerships, we sell new and used cars and light trucks; arrange related vehicle financing; sell service and insurance contracts; provide automotive maintenance and repair services; and sell vehicle parts. Our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas in the U.S., in 32 towns in the U.K., and in key metropolitan markets in the states of Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul and Santa Catarina in Brazil.
As discussed in more detail in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates”, within our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, all of our operating subsidiaries are aligned into one of three operating segments (or regions): the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. The President of U.S. Operations reports directly to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the overall performance of the U.S. region, as well as for overseeing the market directors and dealership general managers. The operations of the Company's two international regions are structured similar to the U.S. region. Our financial information, including our revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets, is segregated into our three operating segments and included in our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page F-1.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy primarily focuses on the performance of our existing dealerships to achieve growth, capture market share, and maximize the investment return to our stockholders. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to improve the overall profitability of our dealerships. For 2019, our priorities will be on three key areas as we continue to become a best-in-class automotive retailer. These areas are:

• | sustained growth of our higher margin parts and service business. Our focus on growth in our parts and service operations continues to hinge on the retention and expansion of our service professionals, targeted marketing efforts, strategic selling and operational efficiencies, as well as capital investments designed to support our growth targets;


• | promotion of the customer experience and customer satisfaction, in all areas of our business; and


• | improvement of operating efficiencies, through further development of our operating model that promotes commonality of processes, systems and training, to further leverage our cost base. We made significant changes in our operating model during the last five years, which were designed to reduce variable and fixed expenses. And, we continue our efforts to fully leverage our scale, reduce costs, enhance internal controls, and enable further growth. As our business grows in 2019 and beyond, we intend to manage our costs carefully and to look for additional opportunities to improve our processes and disseminate best practices. We believe that our management structure supports more rapid decision making and facilitates an efficient and effective roll-out of new processes.

 A key to the execution of our business strategy is the leverage of what we believe to be one of our key strengths — the talent of our people. We believe that we have developed a distinguished management team with substantial industry expertise. With our management structure and level of executive talent, we plan to continue empowering the operators of our dealerships to make appropriate decisions to grow their respective dealership operations and to control fixed and variable costs. We believe this approach allows us to provide the best possible service to our customers, as well as attract and retain talented employees.
We will continue to focus on opportunities to enhance our current dealership portfolio by strategic acquisitions and improving or disposing any underperforming dealerships. We believe that substantial opportunities for growth through acquisitions remain in our industry in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. An absolute acquisition target has not been established for 2019, but we expect to acquire dealerships that provide attractive returns on investment. We believe that as of December 31, 2018, we have sufficient financial resources to support additional acquisitions. We plan to focus our future growth in geographically diverse areas with positive economic outlooks over the longer-term. Further, we intend to critically evaluate our return on invested capital in our current dealership portfolio for disposition opportunities. In 2018, we completed the acquisition of five U.K. dealerships, inclusive of eight franchises, added one franchise and opened one additional dealership for one awarded franchise in the U.K., with expected aggregate annualized revenues of $315.0 million, as estimated at the time of the 
2

acquisitions. The Company acquired four dealerships in the U.S., inclusive of four franchises, and opened one additional dealership, representing one franchise with expected aggregate annualized revenues of $230.0 million. Further, the Company acquired one dealership in Brazil, representing one franchise, and opened one additional dealership, representing one franchise, with expected aggregate annualized revenues of $70.0 million. For more information on our acquisitions and dispositions, including those occurring in 2018, see “Acquisition and Divestiture Program” for further details.
Dealership Operations
Our operations are located in geographically diverse markets that extend domestically across 15 states aggregated into one U.S. region, and internationally in the U.K. and Brazil, representing our three reportable segments: U.S., U.K. and Brazil. See Note 21, “Segment Information” within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further financial information on our three reportable segments. For a discussion of the risks associated with our operations in the U.S., U.K. and Brazil, please see Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The following table sets forth the regions and geographic markets in which we operate, the percentage of new vehicle retail units sold in each region in 2018 and the number of dealerships and franchises in each region:

Region | Geographic Market | Percentage of Our New Vehicle Retail Units Sold During the Year Ended December 31, 2018 | | As of December 31, 2018

Total | | 100.0 | % | | 183 | 238

Each of our local operations has a management structure designed to promote and reward entrepreneurial spirit and the achievement of team goals. The general manager of each dealership, with assistance from the managers of new vehicle sales, used vehicle sales, parts, service, collision and finance and insurance departments, is ultimately responsible for the operation, personnel and financial performance of the dealership. Our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers, and our general managers have a reasonable degree of empowerment within our organization. 
New Vehicle Retail Sales
In 2018, we sold 170,517 new vehicles in retail transactions at our dealerships, representing 32 brands. Our retail sales of new vehicles accounted for 18.0% of our gross profit in 2018. In addition to the profit related to the transactions, a typical new vehicle retail sale or lease may create the following additional profit opportunities for our dealerships:

• | manufacturer dealer incentives;


• | the resale of any used vehicle trade-in purchased by the dealership;


• | arrangement of third-party financing in connection with the retail sale;


• | the sale of vehicle service and insurance contracts;


• | the sale of vehicle parts, accessories or other after-market products; and

3


• | the service and repair of the vehicle both during and after the warranty period.

We consider brand diversity to be one of our strengths. The following table sets forth our consolidated new vehicle sales revenue by brand and number of new vehicle retail units sold in the year ended, as well as the number of franchises we owned as of December 31, 2018:

Our new vehicle unit sales mix was affected by, among other things, our acquisitions and dispositions during 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Some new vehicles we sell are purchased by customers under lease or lease-type financing arrangements with third-party lenders. New vehicle leases generally have shorter terms, bringing the customer back to the vehicle market, and our dealerships specifically, sooner than if the vehicle purchase was debt financed. In addition, lease or lease-type customer financing arrangements provide our dealerships with a steady supply of late-model, off-lease vehicles to be sold as used vehicles. Generally, leased vehicles remain under factory warranty, allowing the opportunity for our dealerships to provide maintenance and repair services for the contract term. However, the penetration rate for other finance and insurance product sales on leases and lease-type customer financing arrangements tends to be less than in other financing arrangements (such as debt financed vehicles). We do not guarantee residual values on lease transactions. Lease vehicle unit sales represented 14.6%, 14.6% and 16.7% of our total new vehicle retail unit sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Used Vehicle Sales, Retail and Wholesale
We sell used vehicles at each of our franchised dealerships. In 2018, we sold 147,999 used vehicles at our dealerships, and sold 53,887 used vehicles in wholesale markets. Our retail sales of used vehicles accounted for 10.9% of our gross profit in 2018. Used vehicles sold at retail typically generate higher gross margins on a percentage basis than new vehicles primarily because of their relatively limited comparability, which is dependent on a vehicle’s age, mileage and condition, among other things. 
Valuations of used vehicles vary based on supply and demand factors, the level of new vehicle incentives, and the availability of retail financing and general economic conditions. Profit from the sale of used vehicles depends primarily on a dealership’s ability to obtain a high-quality supply of used vehicles at reasonable prices and to effectively manage that inventory. Our new vehicle operations generally provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high-quality trade-ins and off-lease vehicles, and are the best source of high-quality used vehicles. Our dealerships supplement their used vehicle inventory with purchases at auctions, including manufacturer-sponsored auctions available only to franchised dealers. We continue to utilize used vehicle management software tools with the goal to enhance the management of used vehicle inventory, focusing on the more profitable retail used vehicle business and reducing our wholesale used vehicle business. This internet-based software tool is an integral part of our used vehicle process, enabling our managers to make used vehicle inventory decisions based on real time market valuation data. It also allows us to leverage our size and local market presence by expanding the pool from which used vehicles can be sold within a given market or region within the U.S., effectively broadening the demand for our used vehicle inventory. Further, this software supports increased oversight of our assets in inventory, allowing us to better control our exposure to declines in used vehicle market valuations, the values of which typically decrease over time.
In addition to active management of the quality and age of our used vehicle inventory, we are focused on increasing the total lifecycle profitability of our used vehicle operations by participating in manufacturer certification programs where 
5

available. Manufacturer certified pre-owned (“CPO”) vehicles offer customers the opportunity to purchase a used vehicle that has passed a rigorous array of manufacturer-defined tests, and are eligible for manufacturer support, such as subsidized finance rates, the extension of manufacturer’s service warranty and other benefits. With the extended service warranty, the sale of CPO vehicles tends to generate better ongoing customer loyalty for maintenance and repair services at the selling dealership. CPO vehicles typically cost more to recondition, but sell at a premium compared to other used vehicles and are available only from franchised new vehicle dealerships. Our CPO vehicle sales represented 40.2% of total used retail sales in 2018. 
In the first quarter of 2018 in the U.S., we launched a new sales program called “Val-U-Line®,” a strategic used vehicle initiative that targets a growing customer niche and enables the Company to retail lower cost, higher mileage units that would have otherwise been sent to the auction. Val-U-Line® leverages our operational discipline and existing assets to create standardized used vehicle policies, merchandising, and pricing options. Given our scale, internal on-line buying center, revamped internal auction capability, and new transportation infrastructure, the Val-U-Line® segment has provided incremental retail volume and represents approximately 10.3% of our U.S. retail used car business. As part of this initiative, the Company has revamped its compensation structure for used vehicle commissions, and has added a used car director and functional support team at the corporate level. We continue to believe that concentrating on the sale of used vehicles at our existing dealerships and utilizing state-of-the-art on-line digital marketing methods to enhance the sale of used cars is a better capital investment as opposed to the costs associated with opening free-standing used car facilities unrelated to a new car dealership location. 
Parts and Service Sales
We sell replacement parts and provide both warranty and non-warranty (i.e., customer-pay) maintenance and repair services at each of our franchised dealerships, as well as provide collision repair services at the 47 collision centers that we operate. We also sell parts to wholesale customers. Our parts and service business accounted for 44.0% of our gross profit in 2018. Customer-pay maintenance and repair services, warranty maintenance and repair services, wholesale parts sales and collision repair services accounted for 45.6%, 20.7%, 20.6% and 13.1%, respectively, of the revenues from our parts and service business in 2018. Our parts and service departments also perform used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle enhancement services in support of our new and used retail vehicle operations for which they realize a profit. However, the revenue for that internal work is eliminated from our parts and service revenue in the consolidation of our financial statements.
The automotive maintenance and repair industry is highly fragmented, with a significant number of independent maintenance and repair facilities in addition to those of the franchised dealerships. We believe, however, that the increasing complexity of new vehicles, especially in the area of electronics and technological advancements, is making it difficult for many independent repair shops to retain the expertise necessary to perform major or technical repairs. We have made investments in recruiting, training, and retaining qualified technicians and advisors to work in our service and repair facilities. And, we have made investments in state of the art diagnostic and repair equipment to be utilized by these technicians. 
Vehicle manufacturers only permit warranty and recall work to be performed at franchised dealerships. Currently, a trend exists in the automobile industry towards longer new vehicle warranty periods and more diligence with manufacturer recalls. As a result, we believe that over time an increasing percentage of all repair work will be performed at franchised dealerships that have the sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel necessary to perform repairs and warranty work on today’s complex vehicles.
Our strategy to capture an increasing share of the available parts and service business and enhance profitability includes the following elements:

• | Invest in the Recruiting, Training and Retaining of Qualified Service Professionals. We are developing and implementing programs designed to more effectively identify and recruit service professionals, onboard and train these service professionals and improve our retention of these service professionals. We believe such efforts will improve customer satisfaction, reduce costs and allow us to grow our parts and service business.


• | Focus on Customer Relationships; Emphasize Preventative Maintenance. Our dealerships seek to retain customers of our new and used vehicles as ongoing clients of our parts and service departments. To accomplish this goal, we use computer systems that track the vehicle owners’ maintenance records and provide advance notice to them when their vehicles are due for periodic service. Our use of computer-based customer relationship management tools increases the reach and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, allowing us to target our promotional offerings to areas in which service capacity is under-utilized or profit margins are greatest. We continue to train our service professionals to establish relationships with their service clients to promote a long-term business relationship. And, we are focused on enhancing access to our service facilities by providing patrons with readily-accessible means to schedule service appointments. We believe our parts and service activities are an integral part of the customer service experience, allowing us to maintain ongoing relationships with our dealerships’ clients and, thereby, deepening customer loyalty to the dealership as a whole.

• | Sell Vehicle Service Contracts in Conjunction with Vehicle Sales. Our finance and insurance sales departments attempt to connect new and used vehicle customers with vehicle service contracts, and thereby enhance repeat customer business for our parts and service departments.


• | Efficient Management of Parts Inventory. Our dealerships’ parts departments support their vehicle sales and service departments, selling factory-approved parts for the respective vehicle makes and models. Parts are either used in repairs made in the service department, sold at retail to customers, or sold at wholesale to independent repair shops and other franchised dealerships. Our dealerships also frequently share parts with each other. Our dealerships employ parts managers who oversee parts inventories and sales. Software programs are used to monitor parts inventory, maximize sales, avoid obsolete and unused parts, and make the best use of manufacturer return procedures.


• | Expansion of Collision Center Operations. We plan to continue to grow our collision center operations. Expansion in this segment of the business is not restricted by franchise agreements or manufacturer relationships. We believe that our concentration of dealership operations in certain of the markets in which we currently operate significantly enhances the profit model opportunities for our collision center operations.

Finance and Insurance Sales
Revenues from our finance and insurance operations consist primarily of fees for arranging financing and selling vehicle service and insurance contracts in connection with the retail purchase of a new or used vehicle. Our finance and insurance business accounted for 27.1% of our gross profit in 2018. We offer a wide variety of third-party finance, vehicle service and insurance products in a convenient manner and at competitive prices. To increase transparency to our customers, we offer all of our products on menus that display pricing and other information, allowing customers to choose the products that suit their needs.
Financing. We arrange third-party purchase and lease financing for our customers. In return, we receive a fee from the third-party finance company upon completion of the financing. These third-party finance companies include manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries, selected commercial banks and a variety of other third-parties, including credit unions and regional auto finance companies. Generally, we do not retain substantial credit risk after a customer has received financing. The fees we receive from the third-party finance companies are subject to chargeback, or repayment, to the finance company in full or in part, if a customer defaults or prepays the financing contract, typically during some limited time period at the beginning of the contract term. We have negotiated incentive programs with some finance companies pursuant to which we receive additional fees upon reaching a certain volume of business. 
Extended Warranty, Vehicle Service and Insurance Products. We offer our customers a variety of vehicle warranty and extended protection products in connection with purchases of new and used vehicles, including:

• | extended warranties;


• | maintenance, or vehicle service, products and programs;


• | guaranteed asset protection insurance, which covers the shortfall between a customer’s contract balance and insurance payoff in the event of a total vehicle loss; and


• | lease “wear and tear” insurance.

The products our dealerships offer are generally underwritten and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries. Under our arrangements with the providers of these products, we either sell these products on a straight commission basis, or we sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future underwriting profit, if any, pursuant to a retrospective commission arrangement. We do not retain the risk of loss for claims made under these contracts. However, the commissions that we earn may be subject to chargeback, in full or in part, if the contract is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity.
Our strategy to improve the customer experience and enhance profitability of our finance and insurance operations includes the following elements:

• | Continue to enhance our product offerings. We are constantly evaluating the mix of insurance products that we offer our customers to ensure that their needs are met. In addition, we regularly work with our current and prospective insurance product providers to assess new product offerings and match them with changing markets and customer demand. Further, we routinely consider our relationships with finance company and insurance product providers, as well as our marketing and other strategies to expand the accessibility and affordability of our product offerings to more of our clients.


• | Improve our processes within the dealership. We routinely consider software and other technological improvements that can make the process by which a customer finances a vehicle purchase and/or purchases an insurance product

7

more efficient. Further, we maintain a focus on compliance with our standard policies and procedures, as well as applicable laws and regulations, in order to optimize the customer experience and overall profitability of each transaction. 
New and Used Vehicle Inventory Financing
See Note 12, “Credit Facilities” within our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for a detailed description of our new and used vehicle inventory financing arrangements.
Acquisition and Divestiture Program
We pursue an acquisition and divestiture program focused on delivering an attractive return on investment.
Acquisition Strategy. We seek to acquire large, profitable, well-established dealerships and franchises that are leaders in their markets to:

• | enhance brand and geographic diversity with primary focus on import and luxury brands;


• | expand into geographic areas we currently do not serve;


• | expand our brand, product, and service offerings in our existing markets;

 and/or

• | capitalize on economies of scale and cost savings opportunities in our existing markets in areas such as used vehicle sourcing, advertising, purchasing, data processing, personnel utilization, and the cost of floorplan financing, thereby, increasing operating efficiency.

We typically pursue dealerships with superior operational management, whom we seek to retain. By retaining existing personnel who have experience and in-depth knowledge of their local market, we believe that we can mitigate the risks involved with employing and training new and untested personnel. In addition, our acquisition strategy targets the purchase of the related real estate to provide maximum operating flexibility.
We focus on the acquisition of dealerships or groups of dealerships that we believe offer opportunities for higher returns, and particularly on brands which provide growth opportunities for our parts and service operations and strengthen our operations in geographic regions in which we currently operate with attractive long-term economic prospects.
Recent Acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired 5 dealerships in the U.K., inclusive of 8 franchises, added one franchise and opened one additional dealership for one awarded franchise. The Company also acquired four dealerships in the U.S., inclusive of four franchises and opened one additional dealership, representing one additional franchise. In addition, the Company acquired one dealership in Brazil, inclusive of one franchise, and opened one dealership, inclusive of one franchise. The expected aggregate annualized revenues, estimated at the time of acquisition, for these acquisitions, were $615.0 million. 
Divestiture Strategy. We continually review the investments in our dealership portfolio for disposition opportunities, based upon a number of criteria, including:

• | the rate of return on our capital investment over a period of time;


• | location of the dealership in relation to existing markets and our ability to leverage our cost structure;


• | potential future capital investment requirements;


• | the brand; and


• | existing real estate obligations, coupled with our ability to exit those obligations or identify an alternate use for real estate.

While it is our desire to only acquire profitable, well-established dealerships, we have, at times, acquired dealerships that do not fit our acquisition strategy in connection with the acquisition of a larger dealership group. We acquire such dealerships with the understanding that we may need to divest some or all of them at some future time. The costs associated with such potential divestitures are included in our analysis of whether we acquire all dealerships in the same acquisition. Additionally, we may acquire a dealership whose profitability is marginal, but which we believe can be increased through various factors, such as: (a) change in management, (b) expansion or improvement in facility operations, (c) relocation of facility based on demographic changes, (d) reduction in costs, and/or (e) sales training. If, after a period of time, a dealership’s profitability does not positively respond, we will seek to sell the dealership to a third party, or, in a rare case, surrender the franchise back to the manufacturer. In conjunction with the disposition of certain of our dealerships, we may also dispose of the associated real estate. Management constantly monitors the performance of all of our dealerships, and routinely assesses the need for divestiture. In connection with divestitures, we are sometimes required to incur additional charges associated with lease 
8

terminations or the impairment of long-lived and/or intangible, indefinite-lived assets. We continue to rationalize our dealership portfolio and focus on increasing the overall profitability of our operations. 
Recent Dispositions. During 2018, we disposed of two dealerships in the U.S., representing three franchises, terminated one additional franchise in the U.S., disposed of one dealership in the U.K., representing one franchise, and terminated one additional franchise in the U.K. These dispositions represented aggregate annual revenues of approximately $195.0 million.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry. In each of our markets, consumers have a number of choices when deciding where to purchase a new or used vehicle and how the purchase will be financed. Consumers also have options for the purchase of related parts and accessories, as well as the maintenance and repair of vehicles. In the U.S., according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, there were approximately 16,802 franchised automobile dealerships as of January 1, 2018, which was up from 16,708 as of January 1, 2017. In the U.K., according to the National Franchised Dealers Association, there were approximately 4,240 franchised dealerships as of January 1, 2018, which was up from 4,184 as of January 1, 2017. In Brazil, according to The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers, there were approximately 4,287 franchised automobile dealerships as of January 1, 2018, which was down from 4,393 as of January 1, 2017. 
Our competitive success depends, in part, on national and regional automobile-buying trends, local and regional economic factors, and other regional competitive pressures. Conditions and competitive pressures affecting the markets in which we operate, or in any new markets we enter, could adversely affect us, although the retail automobile industry as a whole might not be affected. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and personnel resources, and lower overhead and sales costs than we do. We cannot guarantee that our operating performance and our acquisition or disposition strategies will be more effective than the strategies of our competitors.
New and Used Vehicles. We believe the principal competitive factors in the automotive retailing business are location, suitability of the facility, on-site management, the acceptance of a franchise to the market in which it is located, concentration of same franchises in the surrounding markets, service, price, and selection. In the new vehicle market, our dealerships compete with other franchised dealerships in their market areas, as well as auto brokers, leasing companies, and internet companies that provide referrals to, or broker vehicle sales with, other dealerships or customers. We are subject to competition from dealers that sell the same brands of new vehicles that we sell and from dealers that sell other brands of new vehicles that we do not sell in a particular market. Our new vehicle dealer competitors also have franchise agreements with the various vehicle manufacturers and, as such, generally have access to new vehicles on the same terms as we do. We do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from vehicle manufacturers, and our franchise agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer’s product within a given geographic area.
In the used vehicle market, our dealerships compete both in their local market and nationally, including over the internet, with other franchised dealers, large multi-location used vehicle retailers, local independent used vehicle dealers, automobile rental agencies, and private parties for the supply and resale of used vehicles.
Parts, Service and Collision Businesses. We believe the principal competitive factors in the parts and service business are the quality of customer service, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, familiarity with a manufacturer’s brands and models, accessibility and convenience for potential customers, access to and use of technology required for certain repairs and services (e.g., software patches, diagnostic equipment, etc.), location, price, the competence of technicians, and the availability of training programs to enhance such expertise. In the parts and service market, our dealerships compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty maintenance and repairs, conduct manufacturer recall services and sell factory replacement parts. Our dealerships also compete with other automobile dealers, franchised and independent service center chains, and independent repair shops for non-warranty repair and maintenance business. In addition, our dealerships sell replacement and aftermarket parts both locally and nationally over the internet in competition with franchised and independent retail and wholesale parts outlets. A number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than ours. Our collision centers compete with other large, multi-location companies, as well as local, independent, collision service operations.
Finance and Insurance. We believe the principal competitive factors in the finance and insurance business are convenience, interest rates, product availability and affordability, product knowledge and flexibility in contract length. We face competition in arranging financing for our customers’ vehicle purchases from a broad range of financial institutions. Many financial institutions now offer finance and insurance products over the internet, which may reduce our profits from the sale of these products. 
Acquisitions. We compete with other national dealer groups and individual investors for acquisitions. Increased competition, especially for certain luxury and import brands, may raise the cost of acquisitions. In the future, we cannot guarantee that there will be opportunities to complete acquisitions, nor are we able to guarantee that we will be able to complete acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.

Relationships and Agreements with our Manufacturers
Each of our U.S. dealerships operates under one or more franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers (or authorized distributors). The franchise agreements grant the franchised automobile dealership a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s or distributor’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area. These franchise agreements also grant franchised dealerships the right to use the manufacturer’s or distributor’s trademarks in connection with their operations, and impose numerous operational requirements and restrictions relating to, among other things:

• | inventory levels;


• | working capital levels;


• | the sales process;


• | minimum sales performance requirements;


• | customer satisfaction standards;


• | marketing and branding;


• | facility standards and signage;


• | personnel;


• | changes in management;


• | change in control; and


• | monthly financial reporting.

Our dealerships’ franchise agreements are for various terms, ranging from one year to indefinite. Each of our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by the manufacturer for a variety of reasons, including unapproved changes of ownership or management and performance deficiencies in such areas as sales volume, sales effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. In most cases, manufacturers have renewed the franchises upon expiration so long as the dealership is in compliance with the terms of the agreement. From time to time, certain manufacturers may assert sales and customer satisfaction performance requirements under the terms of our framework or franchise agreements. We work with these manufacturers to address any performance issues. Failure to meet such requirements could limit our ability to acquire future dealerships of such manufacturers.
In general, the U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate have automotive dealership franchise laws, providing that, notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement, it is unlawful for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise unless “good cause” exists. It generally is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate, or not renew, a franchise under these laws, which were designed to protect dealers. Though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers’ lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of dealer laws. If dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate in the U.S., manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or showing of good cause. Without the protection of dealer laws, it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration. Further, U.S. federal law, including any federal bankruptcy law, may preempt U.S. state law and allow manufacturers greater freedom to terminate or not renew franchises.
The U.K. generally does not have automotive dealership franchise laws and, as a result, our U.K. dealerships operate without these types of specific protections. However, similar protections may be available as a matter of general U.K. contractual law. In addition, our U.K. dealerships are subject to European Union (“EU”) and U.K. antitrust rules prohibiting certain restrictions on the sale of new vehicles and spare parts and on the provision of repairs and maintenance across the EU. For example, authorized dealers are generally able to, subject to manufacturer facility requirements, relocate or add additional facilities throughout the EU, offer multiple brands in the same facility, allow the operation of service facilities independent of new car sales facilities and ease restrictions on cross supplies (including on transfers of dealerships) between existing authorized dealers within the EU. However, certain restrictions on dealerships may be permissible, provided the conditions set out in the relevant EU Block Exemption Regulations are met. On June 23, 2016, the British citizens voted on a referendum in favor of exiting the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Currently, representatives of both the U.K. and the EU are negotiating an agreement to set both the terms and conditions for the U.K.’s departure from the EU. Any such agreement must be approved by the British Parliament. To date, the British Parliament has not approved an agreement for the U.K. to exit from the EU. The inability of the U.K. and EU to reach such agreement, has created uncertainty in the regulatory environment in the U.K. There has been no clear indication of how and when Brexit will occur or how it will ultimately impact our business operations.

The sale of vehicles in Brazil is regulated by federal law, commonly referred to in Brazil as the Ferrari Law. Such law sets forth the terms and conditions of distribution agreements executed among manufacturers and dealerships, specifically with regard to the distribution of cars, trucks, buses, tractors, motorbikes and similar vehicles. In addition, the Ferrari Law establishes the geographical area of a dealership, termination of distribution agreements and their consequences, among other things. Any contractual provision that conflicts with the Ferrari Law is considered void in Brazil. The distribution agreements contemplate the commercialization of vehicles and components fabricated by the manufacturer, the rendering of technical assistance relating to such products and the usage by the dealerships of the manufacturers’ brand. According to the Ferrari Law, distribution agreements may be executed for either a determined or an undetermined term. In the case of a distribution agreement executed for a determined term, its initial term may not be less than 5 years. At the end of this initial 5 year term, such distribution agreement will be automatically converted into an undetermined term distribution agreement, unless any of the parties thereto expressly waives such right with 180 days prior notice. In the case of an early termination of a distribution agreement other than as a result of a persistent breach or force majeure, the Ferrari law entitles the non-breaching party to, among other things, certain termination payments. 
The U.S. economic recession, that began in 2008, caused domestic manufacturers to critically evaluate their respective dealer networks and terminate certain brands, and, as a result, the respective franchises. For example, General Motors chose to discontinue the Pontiac brand and, as a result, both of our Pontiac franchises were terminated. In addition, Ford chose to discontinue the Mercury brand and, as a result, all four of our Mercury franchises were terminated. In each of these cases, state law required the manufacturer to repurchase new car inventory, parts and accessories, and certain tools and signage, but the dealership would still incur costs associated with such termination. Subject to similar future economic factors and material changes to the regulations discussed above, we generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost or modification.
Our dealership service departments perform vehicle repairs and service for customers under manufacturer warranties. We are reimbursed for the repairs and service directly from the manufacturer. Some manufacturers offer rebates to new vehicle customers that we are required, under specific program rules, to adequately document, support, and typically collect. In addition, some manufacturers provide us with incentives to order and/or sell certain models and/or volumes of inventory over designated periods of time. Under the terms of our dealership franchise agreements, the respective manufacturers are able to perform warranty, incentive, and rebate audits and charge us back for unsupported or non-qualifying warranty repairs, rebates or incentives.
In addition to the individual dealership franchise agreements discussed above, we have entered into framework agreements in the U.S. with most major vehicle manufacturers and distributors. These agreements impose a number of restrictions on our operations, including our ability to make acquisitions and obtain financing, and on our management. These agreements also impose change of control provisions related to the ownership of our common stock. For a discussion of these restrictions and the risks related to our relationships with vehicle manufacturers, please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
The following table sets forth the percentage of our new vehicle retail unit sales attributable to our top five manufacturers in terms of percent of new vehicle retail units sold: 
Manufacturer | Percentage of New Vehicle Retail Units Sold during the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Toyota | 25.2% 
Volkswagen | 13.4% 
BMW | 12.0% 
Ford | 10.9% 
Honda | 9.7% 

Governmental Regulations
Automotive and Other Laws and Regulations
We operate in a highly regulated industry. A number of U.S. state and federal laws and regulations affect our business and the business of our manufacturers. Similar laws and regulations affect our business operations in the U.K. and Brazil, including EU Block Exemption Regulations in the U.K. and the Ferrari Law in Brazil. In every state in which we operate in the U.S., we must obtain various licenses in order to conduct our businesses, including dealer sales, finance and insurance licenses issued by state regulatory authorities. Numerous laws and regulations govern our conduct of business, including those relating to our sales, operations, financing, insurance, advertising and employment practices. These laws and regulations include franchise 
11

laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers, as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. These laws also include U.S. federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws.
Our financing activities with customers are subject to U.S. federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, usury laws, and other installment sales laws and regulations. Some states in the U.S. regulate finance fees and charges that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us, or our dealerships, by individuals or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct dealership operations and fines.
Our U.S. operations are subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. The imported automobiles that we purchase in the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business, we may, from time to time, be subject to claims for duties, penalties, liquidated damages or other charges.
Our U.S. operations are subject to consumer protection laws known as Lemon Laws. These laws typically require a manufacturer or dealer to replace a new vehicle or accept it for a full refund within one year after initial purchase, if the vehicle does not conform to the manufacturer’s express warranties and the dealer or manufacturer, after a reasonable number of attempts, is unable to correct or repair the defect. U.S. federal laws require various written disclosures to be provided on new vehicles, including mileage and pricing information. We are aware that several states in the U.S. are considering enacting consumer “bill-of-rights” statutes to provide further protection to the consumer which could affect our profitability in such states.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) with broad regulatory powers. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded from the CFPB’s regulatory authority, we are required to comply with regulations applicable to privacy notices, and the CFPB acted to regulate automotive financing activities through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions that service the automotive industry. Refer to “We are subject to substantial regulations, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations” of Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the Dodd-Frank Act and its potential impact on us. 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
Our operations in the United States as well as the United Kingdom and Brazil involve the use, handling and storage of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires, and fuel. We contract for recycling and/or disposal of used fluids, filters and other waste materials generated by our operations. In the United States, our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations governing management and disposal of materials and wastes, protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations affect many aspects of our operations, such as requiring the acquisition of permits or other governmental approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which we handle, recycle and dispose of our wastes, requiring capital and operating expenditures to construct, maintain and upgrade pollution control and containment equipment and facilities, imposing specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or incurrence of capital expenditures, restrictions, delays or cancellations in permitting or in the performance of projects, and issuance of injunctions delaying, restricting or prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.
Most of our dealerships utilize above-ground storage tanks, primarily for storing and dispensing petroleum-based products, and above-ground lifts used to raise vehicles. To a lesser extent, our dealerships use underground storage tanks and in-ground lifts. Storage tanks in the United States are subject to testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and its state law counterparts. Similarly, below ground lifts may contain fluid reservoirs that may leak. RCRA imposes requirements relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and requires us to comply with stringent and costly requirements in connection with our storage and recycling or disposal of the various used fluids, paints, batteries, tires, and fuels generated by our operations. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other unauthorized discharges from storage tanks or other equipment operated by us. In addition, water quality protection programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) and comparable state and local programs in the United States govern certain wastewater and storm water discharges from our operations, which discharges may require permitting. Similarly, certain sources of air emissions from our operations including, for example, paint booths, may be subject to permitting, monitoring and reporting 
12

requirements, pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Certain health and safety standards imposed under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act or otherwise promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and related state agencies are also applicable to protection of the health and safety of our employees.
We generally conduct environmental studies on dealerships to be acquired regardless of whether we are leasing or acquiring the underlying real property, and as necessary, implement environmental management practices or remedial or corrective actions to reduce the risk of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. We currently own or lease, and in connection with our acquisition program anticipate in the future owning or leasing, properties that in some instances have been used for auto retailing and servicing for many years. Laws regarding the prevention of pollution or remediation of environmental contamination generally apply regardless of whether we lease or purchase the land and facilities. Although we, or our predecessors, may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, a risk exists that petroleum products and wastes such as new and used motor oil, transmission fluids, antifreeze, lubricants, solvents and motor fuels could have been spilled or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, or under or from other locations where such materials were taken for recycling or disposal. Further, we believe that structures found on some of these properties may contain asbestos-containing materials, although in an undisturbed condition that requires management in place but does not require removal or other corrective action under applicable regulations. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose use, handling and disposal of such petroleum products or wastes were not under our control. In the United States, these properties and the materials transported and disposed from, or released on, them may be subject to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law), RCRA and analogous state laws in the U.S., pursuant to which we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Vehicle manufacturers in the United States are subject to regulations adopted in 2012 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) that establish greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards applicable to light-duty vehicles for model years 2017 through 2021. In August 2018, the Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and EPA under the Trump administration proposed the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (“SAFE”) Vehicles Rule. SAFE, if enacted into law, would amend existing CAFE and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light-duty trucks and establish new standards covering model years 2021 through 2026. The proposal would retain the model year 2020 standards for both programs through model year 2026. 
Legal controls similar to those used in the United States and relating to the management and disposal of materials and wastes, as well as protection of the environment exist in the United Kingdom and Brazil, where we also conduct operations. These legal controls as implemented and enforced in the United Kingdom and Brazil also affect many aspects of our operations in those countries. For example, with regards to the Paris Agreement, the United Kingdom and Brazil each signed that agreement in April 2016. We may incur significant capital expenditures, operational costs and risks of liability and sanction as we seek to comply with those foreign-country environmental legal requirements.
In 2018, our supply of some brands of new vehicles in the U.K. experienced significant shortages caused by the introduction of the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (“WLTP”) legislation. The WLTP is a global harmonized standard for determining the levels of pollutants and CO2 emissions, fuel or energy consumption, and electric range from light-duty vehicles (passenger cars and light commercial vans). The tests have been developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“UN-ECE”) Working Party on Pollution and Energy (“GRPE”). The WLTP replaces the New European Driving Cycle (“NEDC”) procedure for type approval testing of light-duty vehicles.
For further discussion, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. 
U.S. Federal Tax Laws 
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, creating a territorial tax system that generally eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, and requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of their foreign subsidiaries. 
For further discussion, please see Note 8, “Income Taxes” within our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Insurance and Bonding
Our operations expose us to the risk of various liabilities, including:
13


• | claims by employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury or property damage resulting from our operations;


• | weather events, such as hail, tornadoes and hurricanes; and


• | potential fines and civil and criminal penalties resulting from alleged violations of federal and state laws or regulatory requirements.

The automotive retailing business is also subject to substantial risk of real and personal property loss as a result of the significant concentration of real and personal property values at dealership locations. Under self-insurance programs, we retain various levels of risk associated with aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles and claims handling expenses, including property and casualty, automobile physical damage, and employee medical benefits. In certain cases, we insure costs in excess of our retained risk under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. Risk retention levels may change in the future as a result of changes in the insurance market or other factors affecting the economics of our insurance programs. Although we believe our insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot assure that we will not be exposed to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We make provisions for retained losses and deductibles by reflecting charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. Actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. The insurance companies that underwrite our insurance require that we secure certain of our obligations for self-insured exposures with collateral. Our collateral requirements are set by the insurance companies and, to date, have been satisfied by posting surety bonds, letters of credit and/or cash deposits. Our collateral requirements may change from time to time based on, among other things, our total insured exposure and the related self-insured retention assumed under the policies. We are subject to potential premium cost fluctuations with the annual renewal of these programs.
Employees
We believe our relationship with our employees is favorable. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 14,570 (full-time, part-time and temporary) people in the U.S., U.K. and Brazil, of whom:

• | 1,796 were employed in managerial positions;


• | 3,658 were employed in non-managerial vehicle sales department positions;


• | 6,848 were employed in non-managerial parts and service department positions; and


• | 2,268 were employed in administrative support positions.

In Brazil, all employees are represented by a local union. 
Because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers, we may be affected by labor strikes, work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturing facilities and/or their suppliers. Additionally, labor strikes, work slowdowns and walkouts at businesses participating in the distribution of manufacturers’ products may also affect us.
For further discussion, please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
We generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the U.S., in the first and third quarters in the U.K. and during the third and fourth quarters in Brazil. This seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions. The first quarter is generally the weakest in Brazil, driven by heavy consumer vacations and activities associated with Carnival. In addition, in some regions of the U.S., vehicle purchases decline during the winter months due to inclement weather. For the U.K., the first and third calendar quarters tend to be stronger, driven by plate change months of March and September. As a result of all these factors, our consolidated revenues and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters. Other factors unrelated to seasonality, such as changes in economic conditions, inventory availability, manufacturer incentive programs, severe weather events, changes in currency exchange rates or shifts in governmental taxes or regulations may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter-seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income.
