Item 1. Business.
General
Systemax Inc., through its operating subsidiaries, is primarily a direct marketer of brand name and private label industrial and business equipment and supplies in North America going to market through a system of branded e-commerce websites and relationship marketers. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. Certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the Company have been in business since 1949. Our headquarters office is located at 11 Harbor Park Drive, Port Washington, New York.
Current Operations
Industrial Products
Industrial Products Group (“IPG”) sells a wide array of industrial and general business hard goods and supplies and to a lesser extent products that would fall into the generally recognizable category of maintenance, repair and operational (“MRO”) products, which are marketed in North America. Many of these products are manufactured by other companies. Some products are manufactured for us and sold under our brand as a white label product, and some are manufactured to our own design and marketed under the trademarks: Global™, GlobalIndustrial.com™, Nexel™ Paramount™ and Interion™. IPG accounted for 100% of our net sales from continuing operations in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 95% in 2016. 
See Note 3 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information about our business as well as information about our geographic operations.
Products
WE CAN SUPPLY THAT™
We offer over one million brand name and private label products through our e-commerce sites and have access to over 1.7 million products available in our database. We endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers, and periodically remove certain products from our offering to improve efficiencies or to address vendor or market changes. Sourcing hard to find, and non-standard product helps to differentiate our business from our competitors and we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. 
Historically IPG focused on products within the following categories: storage and shelving; material handling; janitorial and maintenance; furniture and office; and workbench and shopdesks. IPG has become a destination and trusted supplier of these products by offering competitive pricing, high service levels, broad and deep product offering, extensive product and sales expertise, and a well-developed Private Label product portfolio offering both high quality and attractively priced alternatives to leading national brands. Other emerging or growing categories are becoming a larger portion of our product portfolio; these include HVAC/R and fans, safety and security, outdoor and grounds maintenance, tools and instruments, office and school supplies, plumbing and pumps, packaging and supplies, electrical and lighting, food service and appliances, raw materials and building supplies, motors and power transmission, pneumatics and hydraulics, medical and laboratory equipment, metalworking and cutting tools, vehicle maintenance, and fasteners and hardware. Within these categories we intend to use the go to market strategy that we successfully employed to grow our legacy core product categories, as discussed below.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products primarily to business customers, which include for-profit businesses, state, local, and private educational organizations and government entities including federal, state, and local municipalities. We have an established multi-faceted direct marketing system and customer life cycle marketing program which tends to begin with customer acquisition via keyword or branding search, supported by strategic account managers, leading e-commerce and account management tools, and deep pre and post sales product expertise which are intended to drive customer retention and penetration and to maximize sales. From time to time we adjust or re-allocate our marketing and advertising spend to best take advantage of changes in market conditions, changes in product mix and/or to drive special sales initiatives and product promotions.

Relationship Marketers
Our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a Systemax account manager. The goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers. With access to the records we maintain, our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values. We also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange (“EDI”) ordering and customized billing services, customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers. Our relationship marketers’ efforts are supported by e-mail campaigns and periodic catalog mailings, both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales, and visits to our interactive websites, which allow customers to purchase products directly online. We believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business, educational and government customer base. We believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet-related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales; just as we believe email campaigns, and to a lesser extent catalog mailings, which feature our websites results in greater internet-related sales.
E-commerce
We currently operate multiple e-commerce sites, including:
 
North America 
www.globalindustrial.com 
www.globalindustrial.ca 
www.industrialsupplies.com


We are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites in our significant markets. Our internet sites feature over one million MRO and industrial and general business supplies. Our customers have around-the-clock, online access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers’ interests. 
In addition to our own e-commerce websites, we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide “click-throughs” from their sites directly to ours. These arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost.
Catalogs
As IPG increased its focus on online and e-commerce advertising, marketing and sales activities over the years, its use of hard copy catalogs decreased as compared to earlier periods, but over the last several years, it has distributed a stable number of regular and specialty catalogs and anticipates continuing to do so in the near term.
Customer Service, Order Fulfillment and Support
We strive to serve our customers in the manner most efficient for how they prefer to operate. A growing proportion of our orders are received electronically via internet, extranet, EDI, customer punch out catalog, online chat, or through broadly utilizing vendor and customer portals such as Ariba or Coupa. Manual orders are received by telephone to our Inbound call center, direct dial to our Inside account management team, placement through one of our field sales representatives, and to a small extent via fax. We generally provide toll-free telephone number access for our customers in countries where it is customary. Certain domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service. 
IPG utilizes a sourcing strategy encompassing sales of in stock items that are either national brands, private label, or white label products as well as supplementing its stocking strategy with product fulfilled directly by our vendor partners via a drop ship relationship. In stock items tend to be higher in velocity, higher in gross margin, and offer a higher service level to our customers. In stock items are distributed via a network of four large distribution centers in the U.S. located in the Northeast, Midwest, West, and Southeast and two additional smaller distribution facilities in Canada. We tend to stock items in our distribution center, and invest the requisite working capital in inventory position, after demonstrating sales volume success in the drop ship sales of that item effected through our suppliers. Orders are generally shipped by third-party delivery services and we maintain relationships with thousands of distributors and product vendors in the United States and Canada.

We maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives, enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions. We conduct regular on-site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings. 
Suppliers
We purchase substantially all of our products and components directly from both large and small manufacturers as well as large wholesale distributors. No supplier accounted for 10% or more of our product purchases related to continuing operations in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Most private label products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications. 
Competition and Other Market Factors
Industrial Products
The market for the sale of industrial products in North America is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships, direct mail distribution, internet-based resellers, large warehouse stores and retail outlets. We face competition from large diversified MRO distributors such as Grainger Inc., MSC Industrial Direct Inc., Fastenal Inc., and other large retailers, including Amazon. We also face competition from manufacturers’ own sales representatives, who sell industrial equipment directly to customers, and from regional or local distributors. Many purchasers begin sourcing products via search engine or mobile application on desktops, laptops, or mobile devices. In the industrial products market, customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price, product selection, product availability, level of service, access to open account terms, and convenience. We believe that direct marketing via sales representatives, the internet and catalogs are effective and convenient distribution methods to reach both our core small and mid-sized customer as well as large enterprises. Further we believe that our customer engagement approach allows for high levels of service to accounts that may purchase high volume capital or durable goods infrequently or that place many small orders for supplies and other consumables that require a wide selection of products. In addition, because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented, we believe it is well suited to private label and white label products.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of approximately 1,550 employees, of whom 1,400 were in North America and 150 were in Asia. Approximately 42% of our employees are customer facing including customer service, quota bearing sales representatives, inbound call center representatives, and other pre and post sales management and support. Approximately 37% of our team members are employed within distribution, logistics, and fulfillment areas, while 21% of our employee base works within administrative functions including: IT, Marketing, Product Management, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, and general administrative and management roles.
Seasonality
Seasonality does have some effect on the Company’s IPG segment. Within IPG, certain product lines are highly seasonal in nature, including HVAC products, snow removal products and outdoor furniture and equipment. In addition, certain customer segment buying cycles, including those of education and government, may tend to be more seasonal than others. Given these trends IPG financial results tend to vary quarter to quarter with sales and margin in the second and third quarters moderately higher than those in the first and fourth quarters respectively.
Environmental Matters
Under various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations in North America, Europe and Asia, a current or previous owner or operator (including the lessee) of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault. We lease most of our facilities. In connection with such leases, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances. Although we have not been notified of, and are not otherwise aware of, any material real property

environmental liability, claim or non-compliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with real property environmental matters in the future.
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations
We currently sell substantially all of our products through established sales channels to our customers in North America (primarily the United States and Canada).   Approximately 4.7%, 4.1%, and 8.1% of our net sales from continuing operations during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively were made by subsidiaries located outside of the United States.
