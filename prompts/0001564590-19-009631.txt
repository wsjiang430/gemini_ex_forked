Overview
 Novus Therapeutics, Inc. (Novus) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing products for patients with disorders of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT). The Company has two platform technologies, each with the potential to be developed for multiple indications. Novus’ lead program (OP0201) is a surfactant-based nasal aerosol drug-device combination product candidate being developed as a potential first-in-class treatment option for patients at risk for, or with, otitis media (OM), which is middle ear inflammation and effusion with or without infection. Globally, OM affects more than 700 million adults and children every year, with over half of the cases occurring in children under five years of age. OM is one of the most common disorders seen in pediatric practice, and in the U.S. is a leading cause of health care visits and the most frequent reason children are prescribed antibiotics or undergo surgery. Novus also has a foam-based drug delivery technology platform (OP01xx), which may be developed in the future to deliver drugs into the ear, nasal, and sinus cavities. 
Surfactant Platform (OP02xx)
 The first product in the surfactant platform program, OP0201, is being developed as a potential first-in-class treatment option for OM. OM is often caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). OP0201 is a nasal aerosol, drug-device combination product comprised of a novel formulation of a surfactant (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine [DPPC]) and a spreading agent (cholesteryl palmitate [CP]) suspended in propellant. The product is administered intranasally via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI). OP0201is intended to be used to restore the normal physiologic activity of the Eustachian tube (ET), which is a small tube that connects from the chamber of the middle ear to the back of the nasopharynx. Together, the active ingredients in OP0201 effectively absorb to the air-liquid interface of the mucosa and reduce the interfacial surface tension of the ET, which reduces passive pressure required for the ET to open. In other words, OP0201 promotes ‘de-sticking’ of the ET so that ventilation of the middle ear is restored. 
 Novus is currently conducting four clinical trials to explore the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of OP0201. These trials include a phase 1 safety and pharmacodynamic effects study (study C-001), a phase 1 safety and tolerability study (study C-002), a phase 1 safety and exploration of effects study in adults with acute otitis media (study C-004), and an exploratory phase 2a study in children with acute otitis media (study C-006). Upon completion of these clinical studies, Novus intends to initiate phase 2 and phase 3 studies, with an initial focus on a development program that, if successful, will lead to registration of OP0201 in North America and key European markets as a product to treat OM and prevent OM in children. Additional development activities to support registration of OP0201 in other countries, or for other indications, or other patient populations, may occur in the future. 
 Foam Platform (OP01xx)
 OP0101 and OP0102 are foam-based products intended to be used as a delivery vehicle for drugs to be administered into the ear canals, as well as the nasal and sinus cavities. OP0101 was the initial product utilizing the foam platform. It was developed as an improved treatment option for acute otitis externa (AOE), a common infectious medical condition of the outer ear canal that affects tens of millions of adults and children each year (frequently called “swimmer’s ear”). Novus completed four clinical trials of OP0101 in 353 adult and pediatric subjects, including a successful phase 2b study with a steroid-free, antibiotic-only formulation of OP0101 that was non-inferior to standard of care, but with a more favorable dosing regimen (once a day dosing instead of twice a day). 
 In 2016, Novus began development of OP0102, a second-generation formulation designed to rapidly relieve ear pain (an unmet need in AOE) and eradicate infection with less than seven days of treatment. Novus subsequently suspended the OP0102 development program to focus resources on the surfactant program.

OP0201 for Otitis Media (OM)
 OM is a generic term without reference to a specific etiology or pathogenesis and best regarded as a spectrum of diseases of the middle ear. OM is a very common condition and a leading cause of healthcare visits and antibiotic prescriptions. Common forms of OM are acute OM (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME). Both AOM and OME can occur episodically or persist for long periods of time. If reoccurrence is frequent (i.e., three episodes within six months), the patient is diagnosed with recurrent AOM (RAOM). If middle ear effusion (MEE) persists in the middle ear for longer than three months, then the patient is diagnosed with chronic OME (COME).
 AOM is very common and can affect both children and adults. AOM is usually a short-term inflammation of the middle ear, characterized by the sudden onset of one or more signs or symptoms of acute middle ear inflammation (e.g., ear pain, fever or irritability) in the presence of MEE. AOM is often preceded by upper respiratory symptoms including cough and rhinorrhea. Micro-organisms (viral or bacterial) in the nasopharynx may reflux into the middle ear, where they adhere and colonize resulting in an ear infection. AOM is extremely common in young children, many of whom will have multiple AOM episodes (RAOM) over the course of months or even years.
 OME is also very common and can affect both children and adults. OME is characterized by a non-purulent (non-infected) MEE without sudden onset of signs or symptoms of an acute ear infection. Symptoms usually involve conductive hearing loss or aural fullness caused by impaired transduction of sound waves through the fluid-filled middle ear, but typically without pain or fever. OME often follows an AOM episode and can last for several months or up to a year, which can result in speech and learning delays in children and other morbidities in both children and adults. There are several predisposing factors that have been associated with OME including environmental (e.g., bottle feeding, day-care setting, allergies to common environmental entities, cigarette smoke), age (higher incidence in pre-school age children), and ETD. Like AOM, patients can experience multiple OME episodes over the course of months or years (recurrent OME; ROME). If MEE persists for longer than three months, then the patient is diagnosed with COME and is often considered as a surgical candidate to insert tympanostomy tubes to facilitate ventilating the middle ear. 
 An important component of middle ear health is a normally functioning ET. The ET is a small cilia-lined passageway that connects the middle ear to the back of the nasal cavity (nasopharynx). Its primary functions are to protect, drain, and ventilate the middle ear. Normally, it is collapsed, preventing material from entering the middle ear. The ET opens periodically upon swallowing, chewing, yawning, or when a pressure differential exists between the middle ear and the external environment. When the ET becomes blocked or does not open normally, ETD occurs.
 Pathophysiology of Otitis Media:

The pathophysiology of OM and ETD are closely related. Both conditions can arise as a result of upper respiratory tract infections, allergies, and other inflammatory mediators and one condition can perpetuate the other condition. There are more than 700 million cases of OM and ETD around the world every year, half of which occur in children under 5 years of age. In the U.S. alone, there were more than 15 million visits to physicians during 2014 related to OM and ETD. It is one of the most common diseases seen in Pediatric and Otolaryngology practices and is the most frequent reason children consume antibiotics or undergo surgery.
 To date, no drug product has been approved to treat OM. Antibiotics are commonly used to treat AOM patients who present with signs and symptoms of infection, but antibiotics have no effect on viral infections or OME which is a non-infectious condition. More importantly, antibiotics do not prevent recurrent AOM, recurrent OME or chronic OME. Topical steroids, antihistamines, and decongestants have not been shown to be effective as OM treatments or to prevent OM. In addition, the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery recommends against use of these drugs in patients with OM. The only option today to treat and possibly prevent RAOM, ROME or COME, is to perform a surgery where the tympanic membrane is perforated to improve drainage and ventilation of the middle ear (myringotomy or tympanostomy tube insertions). However, surgery is not always an effective solution for all patients as many continue to suffer with OM or its complications, and sometimes require repeat surgeries. Managing recurrent and chronic OM drives billions of dollars in healthcare costs and results in millions of surgical procedures in children and adults around the world. There is a clear unmet need for a safe, non-antibiotic, non-surgical option for patients.
 In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted marketing of a medical device that uses a small intranasal balloon inserted into the ET to treat persistent ETD in adults. However, like OM, no drug product has been approved for the prevention of ETD.
 OP0201 is a novel nasal aerosol combination drug product, comprised of the two active ingredients, DPPC and CP, and formulated with a propellant for easy administration. OP0201 is delivered as a local treatment through each nostril using a pMDI device. The pMDI device holds the canister and sprays the drug product into the nasal cavity. Together DPPC and CP are designed to effectively absorb to the air-liquid interface of the mucosa and reduce the interfacial surface tension of the ET, which reduces the passive pressure required for the ET to open. In other words, OP0201 is intended to promote ‘de-sticking’ of the ET so that ventilation of the middle ear may occur. 
 Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, Alabama, U.S.) is our sole supplier of DPPC and CP, the active pharmaceutical ingredients used in OP0201. Other manufacturers of DPPC and CP exist, but we have not yet qualified a secondary supplier. The drug product is currently manufactured using Good Manufacturing Practices by Sciarra Aeromed, Inc. (Hicksville, New York, U.S.). We have not yet qualified a secondary manufacturer. 
 Surfactants are ubiquitous and well-understood endogenous compounds present in human nasal passages, the ET, and lung tissues, as well as in human milk and amniotic fluid. Surfactants have been evaluated under the hypothesis that exogenous administration of surfactant to a mucosal lined lumen such as the alveoli would result in de-sticking of the tissue and allowance of oxygen exchange in the lungs. In the case of the ET, it is known that the quantity of surfactants along the ET of children with OM is significantly reduced when compared to otologically healthy children. Also, the ET surface tension in patients with OM is higher than reported for patients with healthy ETs, causing the luminal surfaces to stick together. Indeed, reduction in ET luminal surface tension and passive opening pressure (POP), as well as improved ET function was demonstrated in a study of six cynomolgus monkeys who received injections of the calf lung surfactant extract INFASURF® (whose main component is the surfactant DPPC) directly into the ET lumen.
 The positive effects of OP0201 on ET function have been observed in preclinical animal studies using an early formulation of a DPPC and CP combination surfactant product. Meaningful reductions in POP of healthy ET, as well as meaningful reduction in severity and duration of OM episodes in three animal species after treatment were observed. In two separate animal-model experiments, the investigators studied the effects of intranasal administration of the early formulation on ET POP of the left ear as compared to propellant in healthy Mongolian gerbils and albino mice. In both animal species, administration of the product resulted in significant (p<0.001) reductions in mean ET POP measurements at both the 5 and 10-minute assessment times compared to baseline and immediately following propellant alone administration (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Among the gerbils, the mean (standard error [SE]) ET POP values (in millimeters of mercury [mmHg]) were 42.8 (2.29) at baseline, 42.43 (2.36) after propellant, 31.76 (1.74) at 5 minutes after surfactant, and 29.3 (1.51) at 10 minutes after surfactant. Similar findings were noted in the mice: mean (SE) ET POP values were 42.02 (1.22) at baseline, 42.02 (1.22) after propellant, 29.77 (1.69) at 5 minutes after surfactant, and 32.79 (1.77) at 10 minutes after surfactant.

 In a study of experimentally induced AOM in chinchillas, the use of the early formulation was associated with a marked reduction in the severity and duration of AOM. Furthermore, quantitative cultures of middle ear fluid showed dramatic decreases in bacterial colonization with intranasal treatment alone (i.e., no antibiotics were administered in this study). Based on these findings, Novus believes that resolution of MEE may occur significantly earlier with treatment. The data suggest that restoration of ET function and ventilation of the middle ear is beneficial in resolving bacterial AOM.
 Prior to licensing rights to the surfactant program, the inventors treated nine humans who had various OM and ETD conditions. This human experience was captured as case studies and reported to the FDA. Based on these case studies, in conjunction with the preclinical animal data, Novus believes that a product of this type may have utility in the treatment and prevention of OM and ETD in children and adults. Novus is currently conducting four clinical trials to explore the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of OP0201. 
  
• | Study OP0201-C-001 (“C-001”) is a phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and ET function following a single intranasal dose of OP0201 in 16 healthy adults. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial will explore the effect of a 20 mg dose of OP0201 on ET function. Assessment of ET function will be captured using continuous tympanic impedance while subjects are exposed to changes in atmospheric pressure produced in a hyperbaric/hypobaric chamber. The single center study will be conducted in Germany. Additional information about the study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov using the identifier NCT03828149.

• | Study OP0201-C-004 (“C-004”) is a phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and relief of ear pain over a 60-minute observation period following a single intranasal dose of OP0201 in 24 adults with acute otitis media. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial will explore the effects of a 20 mg intranasal dose of OP0201. Assessment of pain relief will be captured utilizing a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Clinical Global Impressions Scale: Global Improvement (CGI-I). The multicenter study was conducted in the U.S. Additional information about the study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov using the identifier NCT03766373.

• | Study OP0201-C-006 (“C-006”) is an exploratory phase 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of daily intranasal administration of OP0201 over 10 consecutive days in 50 pediatric patients, 6 to 24 months of age, with acute otitis media. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial will explore the effects of a 20 mg per day dose of OP0201 as an adjunct to oral antibiotics. Patients will receive 10 days of treatment and will be followed for up to 30 days, during which multiple endpoints will be explored. The single center study will be conducted in the U.S. Additional information about the study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov using the identifier NCT03818815.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon completion of these clinical studies, Novus intends to initiate phase 2 and phase 3 studies, with an initial focus on a development program that, if successful, will lead to registration of OP0201 in North America and key European markets as a product to treat OM and prevent OM in children. Additional development activities to support registration of OP0201 in other countries, or for other indications, or for other patient populations, may occur in the future.
 OP0101 and OP0102 for Acute Otitis Externa (AOE)
 AOE (or “swimmer’s ear”) is a generalized inflammation of the epithelium of the external ear canal that may also involve the pinna and/or the tympanic membrane (eardrum). The vast majority of AOE cases are due to bacterial infections, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus being the most common pathogens. The condition is commonly associated with pain and characterized by redness of the ear canal (erythema), swelling of the tissue (edema), increased secretion of fluid, and shedding or peeling of the skin (desquamation of the epithelium). AOE occurs in all age groups and is more frequently observed in the summer months as well as in hot and humid environments. The most common treatment for AOE is antibiotics, with or without steroids, analgesics and avoiding ears being immersed underwater (e.g., swimming). Ear treatments are generally supplied in the form of liquids with several drops administered into each infected ear multiple times per day for a week or longer. In the U.S. alone, more than 5 million prescriptions for ear anti-infective products are prescribed every year, mostly for the treatment of AOE.
 The current market leader in the ear anti-infective market is CIPRODEX®, marketed by Alcon, which according to IMS Health generated over $400 million in sales in the U.S. in 2015. It is a liquid suspension containing the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the steroid dexamethasone. It is administered as four drops per infected ear, twice-daily over seven days for a total of 14 doses (56 drops placed into the ear canal over the course of a week). There are numerous other branded and generic ear anti-infectives, but none of these are clinically differentiated from CIPRODEX. Although effective when administered properly, liquid drops like these anti-infectives can be a challenge to administer into the ear, particularly in children. Proper administration requires the patient to lie down with the infected ear pointed upward, careful placement of multiple drops into the infected ear, manipulation of the ear lobe to move the liquid down into the ear canal, and the patient should remain still with the infected ear pointed upwards after applying the product for a period of time to prevent the medication from draining out of the ear. In addition, rapid resolution of otalgia (ear pain) is not achieved with any of the currently approved anti-infective products, even those that also contain an anti-inflammatory (e.g., steroid) in the formulation, like CIPRODEX.
 Foam formulations such as OP0101 and OP0102 are becoming a prominent delivery system for topical drugs due to the intrinsic advantages of the platform: easy and fast administration, visibility of product during and after the administration, and complete coverage of large and variable surface areas as the product expands and molds to the shape of the cavity. In addition, foam formulations can remain in place for longer periods of time, increasing residence time of drugs at target sites. Finally, foam-based ear products can be administered while the patient is standing or sitting and do not require holding the head in any special orientation for a period of time.

Novus conducted four clinical trials of its first generation, antibiotic only formulation (OP0101), which it believes supported the utility of the foam platform in AOE. Data from the most recent clinical trial was announced in January 2015. The study was a 220 patient, phase 2, randomized, multicenter, parallel, active comparator trial in 220 AOE patients ages six months and older. During this trial, OP0101, which contains 0.3% ciprofloxacin, was administered once-daily for 7 days (7 doses) while the active comparator (CIPRODEX), which contains 0.3% ciprofloxacin and 0.1% dexamethasone, was administered twice-daily for 7 days (14 doses). The primary endpoint of the study was clinical cure, defined as score = 0 for erythema, edema, tenderness, ear discharge (otorrhea), and no further antibiotic required. Safety and efficacy of OP0101 was found to be non-inferior to CIPRODEX, even though OP0101 contained no steroid and utilized 50% fewer doses over the week-long course of therapy. Although OP0101 proved to be effective in treating AOE infection, the product is not sufficiently differentiated from other products in the market. Novus believes that none of the currently marketed products adequately address the greatest unmet need, which is rapid pain relief. Therefore, in 2016, Novus began development of OP0102, a second-generation formulation designed to rapidly relieve ear pain and eradicate infection with less than seven days of treatment. Novus subsequently paused OP0102 development to focus resources on the surfactant program.
 The competitive conditions faced by the Company are described in greater detail in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.”
 Intellectual Property
 Novus’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for its product candidates, novel discoveries, product technologies and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing Novus’s proprietary rights. Novus seeks to protect its product candidates by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to its proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of its business. Novus also relies on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain Novus’s proprietary protection for Novus’s product candidates.
 Novus’s intellectual property portfolio includes issued patents and patent applications directed towards products derived from Novus’s foam platform (OP01xx) and surfactant platform (OP02xx) with claims to pharmaceutical preparations as well as to methods of treatment. For OP0101 and OP0102, Novus owns or has exclusive rights to two families of patents, one with three U.S. and seven foreign patents (Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), and a second with two U.S. and five foreign patents (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). In the first family the last to expire issued patent in the U.S. will expire in September 2027, including patent term adjustment. In the second family the last to expire issued patent in the U.S. will expire in December 2033. For OP0201, Novus has exclusive rights to seven U.S. and three foreign patents (Canada, Mexico, and Europe). The last to expire patent in the U.S. will expire in November 2019. In addition, Novus owns or has exclusive rights to two U.S. patent applications and seven foreign patent applications. If allowed. the last to expire patent application will expire in December 2039, absent any adjustments or extensions.
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 Novus also protects its proprietary information by requiring its employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. In addition, Novus also requires confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive confidential information or materials.
 License Agreement with Otodyne, Inc.
 In November 2015, Novus entered into a license agreement with Scientific Development and Research, Inc. and Otodyne, Inc. granting Novus exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize surfactant-based products. Under the terms of the agreement, Novus is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek approval for and commercialize at least one product for otitis media in the U.S. and key European markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). Novus is responsible for prosecuting, maintaining, and enforcing all intellectual property and will be the sole owner of improvements.

In January 2016, Otodyne completed transfer of all technology, including the active investigational new drug application (IND), to Novus. Novus is obligated to pay up to $42.1 million in development and regulatory milestones if OP0201 is approved for three indications in the U.S., two in Europe, and two in Japan. Novus is also obligated to pay up to $36.0 million in sales-based milestones, beginning with sales exceeding $1.0 billion in a calendar year. Novus is also obligated to pay a tiered royalty for a period up to eight years, on a country-by-country basis. The royalty ranges from low-single to mid-single percent of net sales.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the U.S., including federal, state, and local authorities, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of pharmaceutical and biological products, such as those we are developing. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
 The FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA) or a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the product application by a FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA or NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans in clinical trials. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time during clinical trials and may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit trials, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA or NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials.
 11

A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug (compassionate use). This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug. At this time, Novus does not have a program for the compassionate use of an investigational product outside of a clinical trial as it is not applicable to our investigational products and our current stage of development.
 Submission of a BLA or NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing (e.g. completion of pivotal clinical trials) in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs and NDAs is subject to an application user fee and these fees are typically increased on an annual basis. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the BLA and NDA user fees and may be exempted from product and establishment user fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. No application user fees are anticipated for OP0201 in calendar 2019. 
 A BLA or NDA for a new molecular entity must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from several alternative sources, including investigator-initiated trials that are not sponsored by Novus. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 Once a BLA or NDA for a new molecular entity has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on a BLA or NDA
 The FDA evaluates a BLA to determine whether the data demonstrate that the biologic is safe, pure, and potent, or effective, and an NDA to determine whether the drug is safe and effective. After the FDA evaluates the BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial. The FDA could also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to 
 12

proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production, distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or NDAs or supplements to approved BLAs or NDAs, or suspension or revocation of licenses or withdrawal of approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable 
 13

expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S.
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) as amended, BLAs and NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA or NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric trials are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the BLA or NDA sponsor’s data.
 Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of the product’s approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of the patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA.

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD).
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug...”
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider an “AB” therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of an “AB” rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of the European Union (EU) and in other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial authorization application (CTA) must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The content of the BLA or NDA filed in the U.S. is like that required in the EU, except, among other things, country-specific document requirements
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.
 Countries that are part of the EU, as well as countries outside of the European Union, have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of pharmaceutical and biologic products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Authorization Procedures in the EU
 Medicines can be authorized in the EU by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
  
• | Centralized procedure. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16

 
• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric trials and their timing relative to clinical trials in adults. Because Novus intends to pursue pediatric indications for OP0201 before adult indications, a PIP will be submitted to EMA and other EU countries, as required. The PIP will need to be submitted early during product development, before marketing authorization applications are submitted. The timing of PIP submission cannot be after initiation of pivotal trials or confirmatory (phase 3) trials.
 Exclusivity of New Chemical Entities and New Fixed Dose Combinations
 In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances as well as new fixed dose combinations, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which a generic application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval
 Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances may be applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization may be applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.
Accelerated Review
 Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the 
 17

reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third- party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, any law replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal or replacement on our business remains unclear. Adoption of government controls, measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 In European countries, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. and other countries has increased, and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 18

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the provision of the Affordable Care Act referred to as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug and biologics manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests of physicians and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

 Reverse Merger
 On December 21, 2016, Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Tokai”), a Delaware corporation, Otic, and the stockholders of Otic Pharma, Ltd. (“Otic”) (each a “Seller” and collectively, the “Sellers”), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, each Seller agreed to sell to Tokai, and Tokai agreed to purchase from each Seller, all of the common and preferred shares of Otic (“Otic Shares”) owned by such Seller in exchange for the issuance of a certain number of shares of common stock of Tokai, as determined pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement (the “Reverse Merger”). The parties amended and restated the Share Purchase Agreement on March 2, 2017.
 On May 9, 2017, Tokai, Otic, and the Sellers closed the transaction contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement, and subsequently effected a reverse stock-split of common stock at a ratio of one-for-nine (see Reverse Stock-Split below). On a post-split basis, Tokai issued to the Sellers an aggregate of 4,027,693 shares of Tokai’s common stock in exchange for 840,115 Otic Shares. Following the completion of the Reverse Merger, the business being conducted by Tokai became primarily the business conducted by Otic. In connection with the Reverse Merger, the name of the surviving corporation was changed to “Novus Therapeutics, Inc.”
