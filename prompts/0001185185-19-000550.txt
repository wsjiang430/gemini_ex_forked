Introduction
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read together and in connection with the other reports that have been filed by us with the SEC for a comprehensive description of our financial condition and operating results.  In the interest of disclosure, we have included in this Form 10-K certain material events and developments that have taken place through the date of filing of this Form 10-K with the SEC.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, INVO Bioscience, Inc. (INVO Bioscience, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this document as “we”, “us”, “INVO Bioscience”, “INVO,” or the “Company”), incorporates by reference certain information from parts of other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Securities and Exchange Commission allows us to disclose important information by referring to it in that manner.  Please refer to all such information when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  All information is as of December 31, 2018 unless otherwise indicated.  For a description of the risk factors affecting or applicable to our business, see “Risk Factors,” below.
 
The Company
 
INVO Bioscience’s mission is to increase access to care and expand fertility treatment and patient care across the globe. We have developed the INVOcell device and procedure, the first Intravaginal Culture (IVC) system granted FDA clearance in the United States, in hopes of providing millions of infertile couples across the globe access to this new infertility treatment. We believe this novel device and procedure provides a more natural, safe, effective and economical fertility treatment compared to current infertility treatments, including in-vitro fertilization (“IVF”) and intrauterine insemination (“IUI”). The patented INVOcell device is utilized during the incubation of eggs and sperm during fertilization and early embryo development. Unlike conventional infertility treatments such as IVF where the eggs and sperm develop into embryos in a laboratory incubator, the INVOcell utilizes the women’s vaginal cavity as an incubator to support a more natural fertilization and embryo development environment. This novel device promotes In Vivo conception and early embryo development.
 
In both current utilization of the INVOCell and in clinical studies, the INVO Procedure has proven to have equivalent pregnancy success rates and live birth rates as the traditional assisted reproductive technique IVF. Additionally, we believe there are psychological benefits of the potential mother’s participation in fertilization and early embryo development by vaginal incubation compared to that of traditional IVF treatment. This new technique offers to patients a more natural and personalized way to achieve pregnancy and is simple enough to be performed in an appropriately trained physician’s office or in a satellite facility of an IVF center.
 
For many couples struggling with infertility, access to treatment is often not available. Financial challenges, limited availability of specialized medical care, religious, social and cultural roadblocks can prevent these hopeful couples from realizing their dream to have a baby. There are many benefits to the INVO Solution, including:
 

● | Reduces the risk of errors of wrong embryo transfers since the embryos are never separated from the woman.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Allows patients to receive treatment at approximately half the cost of IVF treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promotes greater involvement by couples in the treatment and conception.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creates a more natural and environmentally stable incubation than traditional IVF incubation in a laboratory.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Requires fewer office visits for the couples.
--+----------------------------------------------


● | Reduces the worry of leaving embryos in an incubator where mix-ups have been known to occur.

INVO Bioscience was formed on January 05, 2007 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts under the name “Bio X Cell, Inc.” to acquire the assets of Medelle Corporation (“Medelle”).  Dr. Claude Ranoux purchased all of the assets of Medelle, and then he contributed those assets, including four patents relating to the INVOcell technology, to Bio X Cell, Inc. upon its formation in January 2007.

On December 5, 2008, Bio X Cell, Inc., doing business as INVO Bioscience, and each of the shareholders of INVO Bioscience entered into a share exchange agreement and consummated a share exchange with Emy’s Salsa AJI Distribution Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Emy’s”). Upon the closing of the share exchange on December 5, 2008, the INVO Bioscience shareholders transferred all of their shares of Common Stock in INVO Bioscience to Emy’s.   In connection with the share exchange, Emy’s changed its name to “INVO Bioscience, Inc.” and Bio X Cell, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emy’s (re-named INVO Bioscience, Inc.).  After the closing, the Company had 53,245,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding.  
 
In May 2008, we received notice that the INVOcell product meets all the essential requirements of the relevant European Directive(s), and received CE Marking.  The CE marking (also known as CE mark) is a mandatory conformity mark on many products placed on the single market in the European Economic Area (EEA).  The CE marking (an acronym for the French “Conformite Europeenne”) certifies that a product has met EU health, safety and environmental requirements, which ensure consumer safety.  We are currently awaiting the approval of our CE Mark re-certification. With our anticipated re-certification of our CE Mark in the near future, we expect to obtain regulatory authority to distribute product in the European Economic Area, provided we comply with local registration requirements as discussed herein (i.e., the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America).  
 
On November 2, 2015 INVO Bioscience was notified by the United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) that the INVOcell and INVO procedure were granted DeNovo classification allowing the Company to market the INVOCell in the United States. The company has since begun to market and sell the INVOcell in many locations across the U.S. and plans on continuing to penetrate the market through 2019 and beyond. The Company currently has 90 appropriately trained clinics or satellite facilities of IVF centers in the U.S. where patients can receive guidance and treatment for the INVO procedure for infertility.
 
As with most innovative bioscience businesses, one of the biggest challenges that INVO Bioscience faces is raising the appropriate capital to implement its business plan while opening markets across the globe. On November 12, 2018, INVO Bioscience entered into a Distribution Agreement with Ferring International Center S.A. (“Ferring”) granted to Ferring exclusive licensing rights to sublicense the Company’s INVOcell together with the retention device. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement Ferring was obligated to make an initial payment to the Company of $5,000,000 upon satisfaction of certain closing conditions. We believe the developed business relationship between the Company and Ferring as a result of the Distribution Agreement will help INVO in any future capital raising efforts.

The INVOcell Technology
 
Our product, the INVOcell medical device, is designed to treat infertility at a lower cost than other treatments available in today’s marketplace, including IVF.  The INVOcell technology is a fertility treatment where mild ovarian stimulation is used.  Using a mild stimulation protocol, 1-7 follicles are retrieved from a woman in a physician’s office with the patient under light sedation with or with local anesthesia.  The follicle retrieval is performed using a vaginal probe under ultrasound guidance.  Eggs are identified immediately after retrieval in the follicular fluid.  During the INVO Procedure, fertilization and embryo development occurs inside the woman’s vaginal cavity in a disposable single use device -- the INVOcell -- that holds the eggs, sperm and culture medium, a nutrient liquid.
 
Sperm collection and preparation generally occur before egg retrieval.  Culture medium (~1ml) is placed in the inner vessel of the INVOcell.  Eggs and a low concentration of motile sperm are placed into the medium and the inner vessel is closed and secured in the protective outer vessel.  The INVOcell is placed in the patient’s vaginal cavity for an incubation period of three (3) days in the United States and five (5) days in other countries.  A retention system can be used to maintain the INVOcell system in the vagina during the incubation period.  The retention system consists of a diaphragm type device with holes in the membrane to allow natural elimination of vaginal secretions.  The INVOcell is designed so that no vaginal fluids penetrate the outer vessel thus ensuring that the inner vessel is not contaminated while allowing the necessary CO2 for fertilization to pass through.  The eggs, sperm and media are inserted into the INVOcell and then the INVOcell is placed in the vaginal cavity, this process takes approximately 30 minutes. 
 
After three (3) to five (5) days, the patient returns to the physician’s office where the retention system and the INVOcell are removed.  The protective outer vessel is discarded and the contents of the inner vessel are placed into a petri plate an embryologist can evaluate the best embryos for transfer.  A trained clinician can readily identify the best embryos for transfer. The embryos to be transferred are aspirated into a standard transfer catheter for transfer into the patient’s uterus.  This second visit should take approximately 30 minutes. All INVO related medical procedures can be performed in a physician’s office furnished with the necessary equipment thereby avoiding the requirements of an IVF facility and the associated costs to build and maintain such a facility.

Operations Strategy and Suppliers
 
INVO Bioscience operates by outsourcing many key operational functions in the development and manufacturing of the INVOcell device to keep fixed costs to a minimum.  Our most critical management and leadership functions are carried out by our core management team.  We have contracted out the manufacturing, packaging/labeling and sterilization of the device, respectively to a certified manufacturer to mold the parts; to a medical manufacturing company to assemble packages and label the product; and to a sterilization specialist to perform the gamma sterilization process.  Outsourcing such operations as described expedites production and eliminates the need for in-house capital equipment expenditures.
 
To date, we have completed a series of important steps in the development and manufacturing of the INVOcell:
 

● | Manufacturing: Our parts and manufacturing processes have been validated. Our facilities and Quality Management Systems (QMS) have been inspected twice by the FDA and have received very good reports. Manufacturing of inventory is ongoing. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 100 INVOcell devices ready for sale, and a 3,600 in the assembly, sterilization and packaging phase. Our suppliers provide us with virtually an unlimited capability, with all manufacturing done in New England. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | All raw materials utilized for the INVOcell are medical grade and commonly used in medical devices (i.e.; medical grade silicone, medical grade plastic). Our principal mold supplier is a well-established company in the molding industry and is ISO 9001 Certified. Our contract manufacturer for the INVOcell is ISO 13485 Certified and FDA inspected. 
● | CE Mark: INVO Bioscience is in the process of re-certifying the CE Mark. The CE Mark permits the sale of devices in Europe, Australia and other countries that recognize the CE Mark, subject to local registration requirements. 
● | Clinical Trials: Safety and efficacy of the INVOcell device has been demonstrated and cleared for marketing and use by the U.S. FDA. INVO Bioscience has received ISO 13485, MDD/CMDCAS registration which is effective through 2018. 
● | Support of Practitioners: Clinicians and laboratory directors have used the INVO method and the feedback has been positive; practitioners appreciate the fact that it is a patient-friendly procedure, easy to perform and effective. 
● | Marketing Trials/Studies: A number of fertility clinics completed clinical studies in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil, South America, showing efficacy rates in the 33%-43% range. A U.S. clinical study utilizing the INVOcell and procedure was completed in 2014 and yielded a clinical pregnancy rate of 60% and a live birth rate of 55%. The largest practice currently offering the INVO Procedure is experiencing a 60% pregnancy rate. Current US physicians that are treating patients with the INVO procedure are reporting pregnancy result minimally equivalent to IVF. 

Current Market Opportunity
 
According to the European Society for Human Reproduction (“ESHRE”) in 2018, Assisted Reproductive Technologies (“ART”) Fact Sheet, there were more than 150 million infertile couples in the world.  While there have been large increases in the use of IVF, only 1.5 million ART cycles, including IVF, intra uterine insemination (“IUI”) and other fertility treatments, are now performed globally each year, producing around 350,000 babies.  This amounts to the treatment of approximately 3% of the infertile couples worldwide being treated and only1% having a child though IVF.  A survey by “Resolve: The National Infertility Association,” indicates the two main reasons couples do not use IVF is cost and geographical availability.  We can provide a locally available treatment option that can be performed in a facility without much of the expensive equipment required for IVF, and at less than half of the cost of IVF that will help millions of infertile couples throughout the world where IVF is not currently available or is too costly.
 
IVF is an effective treatment option for many infertile couples.  Our patented and proven INVO technology is a unique, low cost fertility treatment that is much simpler to perform than IVF.  The procedure can be provided without an IVF center and therefore can be available in many more locations than IVF.  We believe we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this unmet market.  With our INVOcell device and technique, fertilization and early embryo development happens within the vaginal cavity rather than an incubator.  Oocytes and sperm are fertilized and developed into embryos within the INVO device while contained by the woman’s vaginal cavity.
 
According to ESHRE (2014), approximately 1% of infertile couples have a child by an infertility treatment, including IVF, intra uterine insemination (“IUI”) and other fertility treatments, this represents a $6.6 billion worldwide market annually.  This leaves most of the infertile couples untreated with an estimated unmet market opportunity in the billions, INVO Bioscience believes a portion of this market will be met by the INVOcell device.  Much of the unmet market is located in developing countries where many patients cannot afford, and have limited access to, IVF.  We believe that developing countries offer a large and ready market for the INVO Procedure.
 
In the United States infertility according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (2017) affects an estimated 10%-15% of the couples of child bearing age. Based on preliminary 2016 data from CDC’s National ART Surveillance System, 263,577 IVF cycles were performed at 463 IVF centers with 65,840 of these cycles performed for egg banking for future use.

These transferred cycles resulted in 65,969 live births and 78,897 babies born. Outcomes per transfer of fresh embryos averaged a clinical pregnancy for woman under 35 years of age was 52% dropping to 38% for woman 38-40 years of Age. Outcomes per transfer of frozen embryos averaged a clinical pregnancy for woman under 35 years of age was 59% dropping to 54% for woman 38-40 years of Age. Although the use of IVF is still relatively rare as compared to demand its use has doubled over the past decade. Today approximately 1.7% of the infants born in the United States every year are conceived through IVF.
 
In November 2015 we received notice that the INVOcell device met all of the requirements for U.S. FDA clearance. The FDA clearance has allowed the company to begin launching the INVOcell product and procedure in the United States. This has been our focus from approval through 2018.
 
On November 12, 2018, INVO Bioscience, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Distribution & Supply Agreement with Ferring International Center S.A. (“Ferring”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company granted to Ferring an exclusive license in the United States (the “Territory”) with rights to sublicense under patents related to the Company’s proprietary intravaginal culture device known as INVOcell™, together with the retention device and any other applicable accessories (collectively, the “Licensed Product”) to market, promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Product with respect to all therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic uses of medical devices or pharmaceutical products involving reproductive technology (including infertility treatment) in humans (the “Field”). Ferring is responsible, at its own cost, for all commercialization activities for the Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory. The Company does retain a limited exception to the exclusive license granted to Ferring allowing the Company, subject to certain restrictions, to establish up to five clinics that will commercialize INVO cycles in the Territory. The Company retains all commercialization rights for the Licensed Product outside of the United States.
 
Ferring is a visionary, privately-held biopharmaceutical company recognized around the world. Its mission is to help patients live better lives… by researching, developing, manufacturing and marketing the most effective and innovative products in reproductive health, women’s health, urology, gastroenterology, endocrinology and orthopedics. They make their products available in over 100 nations with more than 5,000 employees’ word wide. They have R&D facilities doing groundbreaking work in Denmark, Israel, Switzerland, China, India, Scotland and the U.S.A. To support the INVOcell initiative Ferring has a new U.S. Operations Center, on a sprawling 25 acre campus in Parsippany, NJ, which includes a state-of-the-art manufacturing suite, next-generation product development laboratories and a fully equipped education and training center.
 
Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, Ferring was obligated to make an initial payment to the Company of $5,000,000 upon satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including an agreement from all current manufacturers of the Licensed Product that upon a material supply default by the Company, Ferring can assume a direct purchase relationship with such manufacturers. The Closing under the Distribution Agreement occurred on January 14, 2019 at which time Ferring made the initial $5,000,000 upfront payment to the Company. Ferring is obligated to make a second payment to the Company of $3,000,000 provided that the Company is successful in obtaining a five (5) day label enhancement from the FDA for the current incubation period for the Licensed Product at least three (3) years prior to the expiration of the term of the license for the Licensed Product and provided further that Ferring has not previously exercised its right to terminate the Distribution Agreement for convenience. In addition, under the terms of a separate Supply Agreement, attached as an exhibit to the Distribution Agreement, Ferring is obligated to pay the Company a specified supply price for each Licensed Product purchased by Ferring for distribution.
 
The Distribution Agreement has an initial term expiring on December 31, 2025 and at the end of the initial term it may be terminated by the Company if Ferring fails to generate specified minimum revenues to the Company from the sale of the Licensed Product during the final two years of the initial term. Provided that no such termination occurs at the end of the initial term, thereafter the term of the Distribution Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive three (3) years terms unless terminated by mutual consent. The Distribution Agreement is subject to termination upon a material breach by either party, or by Ferring for convenience.
 
On January 14, 2019, the Company executed the Ferring Distribution and Supply agreements and received its initial $5 million dollars payment.
 
As indicated above, in May 2008 we received notice that the INVOcell device met all of the essential requirements of the relevant European Directive, and received CE marking.   The CE marking certifies that a product has met European health, safety and environmental requirements, which ensure consumer safety.  Manufacturers in Europe and abroad must meet CE marking requirements where applicable in order to market their products in Europe.  Since it has been over nine years since we first received the CE marking, we are currently in the re-certification process with the appropriate regulatory bodies and expect to have this completed in the near future.  With CE marking, we will have the necessary regulatory authority to distribute our INVOcell device in the European Economic Area, subject to local registration regulations.

Currently, we are continuing to establish agreements with distributors and train physicians outside of the U.S.  The international market will be a primary focus as a result of our recently signed agreement with Ferring for the U.S. Market.
 
Competition
 
The infertility industry is highly competitive and characterized by technological improvements.  New assisted reproductive technology (“ART”) services, devices and techniques may be developed that may render the INVOcell obsolete.  Competition in the areas of infertility and ART services is largely based on pregnancy rates and other patient outcomes.  Accordingly, the ability of our business to compete is largely dependent on our ability to achieve adequate pregnancy rates and patient satisfaction levels.  The INVO procedure will offer an alternative treatment to couples that currently do not have access to treatments because of cost or location.  Infertility clinics can expand their businesses by offering INVO in satellite centers that can be opened at a substantially lower cost than an IVF center.  We are not aware of any direct competitors to INVO Bioscience or the INVO process using the INVOcell device.  However, there are existing infertility treatment regimens that the INVOcell will compete with when an infertile couple, in conjunction with their physician, is choosing the treatment method for their infertility.  We believe that the menu of currently available clinical infertility treatment methods generally is limited to IUI and IVF.
Competing Treatments
 
Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI):   In IUI treatments, ovarian stimulation protocols with induction of ovulation are frequently used to recruit several follicles and improve clinical pregnancy rates.  When monitoring of ovulation indicates that the female patient is ready to ovulate, the male patient will produce a sperm sample in the fertility doctor’s office.  The sperm is then prepared and delivered to the uterus through a catheter.  Currently IUI can only treat approximately 40% of the causes of infertility.  For example, IUI does not address infertility causes such as tubal disease and other conditions that are treatable by IVF and the INVOcell device and process.  In addition, IUI does not produce the diagnostic information such as fertilization that an IVF or INVO cycle produces.  Approximately 600,000 IUI cycles are performed annually by a subset of about 5,000 doctors in the U.S. as well as by IVF providers.  In Europe, at least 550,000 IUI cycles are performed annually.  The cost of a single IUI treatment can range from $800 to $3,000 per cycle in the U.S. and $500 to $2,000 in Europe.  The intra-country differences in cost primarily depend on the stimulation protocol and the ovulation monitoring used by the physician.
In Vitro Fertilization (IVF):  IVF addresses tubal factor, ovulatory dysfunction, diminished ovarian reserve, endometriosis, uterine factor, male factor, unexplained infertility and other causes.  IVF bypasses the function of the fallopian tube by achieving fertilization within a laboratory environment.  Ovarian hyper-stimulation is common with IVF treatments to recruit numerous follicles to purportedly increase the chances for success.  Follicles are retrieved trans-vaginally using a vaginal probe and ultrasound guidance.  General anesthesia is frequently used due to the number of follicles retrieved and the resulting discomfort experienced by the patient.  The eggs are identified in the follicular fluid and combined with sperm and culture medium in culture dishes, which are placed in an incubator with a temperature and gas environment designed to mimic the condition of the fallopian tubes.  Once the embryos develop, typically over a 3-5 day period, they are transferred to the uterine cavity.  The transfer of several embryos allows an average success rate for IVF of 37%, but it is also responsible for a multiple birth rate of approximately 7.5% of IVF pregnancies.  Multiple births bring risks to mother and babies and significant expenses for third party payers.  In addition, due to the high number of embryos produced in IVF, cryo-preservation of excess embryos occurs in more than 30% of the cycles.  According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), in the U.S. there are approximately 1,000 reproductive endocrinologists who collectively perform more than 197,000 embryo transfer IVF cycles and an additional 65,840 cycles are performed and frozen per year at 463 specialized facilities.  According to European Society of Human Reproduction & Embryology (“ESHRE”), in Europe nearly 300,000 IVF cycles are reportedly performed at more than 1,000 facilities.
 
The cost to the patient for a single IVF cycle (including drugs) is in the $11,000 - $16,000 range in the U.S. and can go as high as $20,000 depending on the IVF center.  The cost of drugs for an IVF cycle ranges from $2,500 to $4,000.  The average cost per live birth using IVF can exceed $50,000 since the successful patient may require more than one cycle depending on the age of the patient.  Many patients who would be good candidates for IVF are unable to access it because of the high cost and lack of insurance reimbursement.  Additional obstacles to IVF often include significant distances to IVF clinics; travel costs; and time off from work.  In addition, some couples experience concerns regarding IVF such as the possibility of laboratory errors resulting in receiving another person’s embryo.

Competitors
 
We operate in a highly competitive industry, which is subject to competitive pricing and rapid technological change. The first IVF baby, Louise Brown was born in 1977, making the IVF treatment 40 years old.  Our INVOcell device is the first new treatment option for patients in 40 years. The market for fertility treatment and devices are highly competitive in terms of pricing, functionality and service quality, the timing of development and introduction of new products and services and terms of financing.  We face competition from all ART practitioners and device manufacturers.  Our competitors may implement new technologies before we do, allowing them to offer more attractively priced or enhanced products, services or solutions.  Our competitors may have greater resources in certain business segments or geographic markets than we have.  We may also encounter increased competition from new market entrants or alternative ART technologies.  Our ability to compete in this market successfully will require us to adapt to economic or regulatory changes, to introduce new products to the market and to enhance the functionality while reducing the cost of new and existing products.
 
Our principal ART medical-device competitor is Anecova, a Swiss life sciences company with an intrauterine device under development for infertility treatment.  This device is a very small silicone tube with 360 micro perforations.  Oocytes are fertilized outside the device and then placed in the tube, which is placed inside the woman’s uterus for early embryo development.  After 1-5 days, the device is removed and the best embryo(s) are transferred back into the woman’s uterus.  We believe that the device is much more difficult to use than the INVOcell due to its size and the requirement to place the device in the uterus, a sterile environment.  We expect that the precision manufacturing of the Anecova device will drive its cost close to $1,500 per unit, which is higher than our price.  The Anecova device would only be available in hospitals and IVF Centers at a significantly higher cost than the INVOcell.  Currently the Anecova device has not begun clinical studies in the United States that will be required for FDA approval, therefore the device will not be available for some time in the United States and many other areas of the world.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that the INVOcell has the following competitive advantages:
 
Lower cost than IVF with similar efficacy:  The INVOcell is substantially less expensive than IVF due to a lower cost of supplies, labor, capital equipment and overhead.  We estimate that an IVF center requires at least $500,000 of laboratory capital equipment as well as highly trained personnel.  In contrast, the cost of laboratory capital equipment to set-up an INVOcell procedure is approximately $100,000 and does not require highly trained embryologists that are required for traditional IVF.
 
In 2016, according to a draft report prepared by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), there were 263,577 ART cycles. Out of these cycles 65,840 were performed for freezing of embryos for the future and 197,000 cycles were performed through embryo transfer. These cycles resulted in 31%live births with a clinical pregnancy rate of 35.9%.  (CDC 2016 ART Report).  The INVO procedure will be offered at a more attractive price per cycle with a pregnancy rate comparable to traditional IVF.  According to Resolve, National Fertility Association, IUI cycles costs $275- $2,457 per cycle (variability due to drug costs and diagnostics inclusion on some cycles) and the cost range of IVF is $9,000-11,000 per cycle plus drug costs. Drug cost range from $3,000-$5,000 per cycle brining the cost range of IVF to $12,000 - $16,000 per cycle.  The INVO procedure is being offered at $4,500 - $6,500 per cycle inclusive of medications thereby making it more affordable than traditional IVF.
 
Similar cost than IUI with greater efficacy: It is estimated by Resolve that in the U.S. currently IUI averages $1,500 per cycle with approximately <10-12% pregnancy rate while IVF averages $12,000 - $16,000 range per cycle with an average of 35.9% pregnancy rate.  With INVO, we believe that the Ob/Gyn and reproductive endocrinologists will benefit by providing a superior product than IUI with good financial margins, efficacy rates more than triple IUI while treating the full range of infertility indications.  In Europe, according to ESHRE the average cost per pregnancy using IUI is $12,000.  According to ESHRE the average cost per pregnancy for IVF is $21,354 while for INVO it is only $13,888: a savings of more than $7,000 per pregnancy.  Using INVO could reduce annual infertility costs in Europe by more than $650 million.
 
Greater geographic availability:   According to 2016 CDC Report, there are approximately 463 IVF centers in the U.S.  In addition, by having INVO geographically available in Ob/Gyn offices, couples will avoid the travel costs and absence from work associated with long-distance IVF treatments.  The medical staff at these centers could easily learn the INVO technique and offer it as a lower cost treatment option for their patients through satellite centers.  According to the American College of Gynecologists (ACOG) there are also approximately 5,000 Ob/Gyn physicians in the U.S. who offer infertility services such as the IUI treatment but lack the facilities to offer an IVF treatment.  Since INVO does not require a specialized lab facility, large costly equipment or highly specialized staff, the INVO treatment may be offered in a doctors’ office with the addition of minor capital equipment potentially expanding business for these physicians.  Therefore, in the U.S. alone, INVO could be 10 times more available than conventional IVF.  Ob/Gyn offices worldwide could offer INVO as an alternative or follow up treatment to IUI and generate a significant new revenue stream.

Greater patient involvement: With INVO, the patient uses her own body as the incubation environment.  This creates a greater sense of involvement, comfort and participation for patients who know that the fertilization is happening within their own bodies.  In some cases, this may free a couple from ethical or religious concerns, or fears of laboratory mix-ups that could result in a patient receiving another couple’s embryo(s).
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
Customers
 
Currently our customers are the doctors who can offer the INVO Procedure to their patients. Through the end of 2018, we have trained doctors from 20 states. We typically train both a reproductive endocrinologist and an embryologist from the practice.  We are grateful to these pioneers who have made the choice to explore our novel device.  They are attempting to expand the market and provide a reproductive service to a broader range of patients who typically would have just left the office and gone home.  These doctors are going through medical and business learning curves as they introduce the INVOcell device and procedure to others within their offices and to prospective patients. They are trying to determine where INVO fits into their practice.  They do not want to impact the strong business models they have in place today but at the same time see the need for INVO in the marketplace.
 
Every center offering the INVO procedure today is in a different place, some have figured out the balance and have a steady mix of procedures. While others are having difficulty recruiting patients or working through politics and existing beliefs to get the INVO offering off the ground.  A couple of doctors have already started planning where they can open new offices to help meet the demand in their area by using the INVOcell.  Another trend we see developing is that once there is one practice offering the INVO Procedure other physicians within the general area have reached out to us to be trained.
 
Since receiving FDA clearance we have shipped over 3,800 INVOcells in the US, not all have been revenue producing as new physicians and embryologists have to practice after training to get better at the slight technique differences of what they have been doing for many years. We have shipped an additional 500 INVOcells across the rest of the word as others are doing the same as the US doctors in learning the process.
 
As we have stated once getting comfortable with the process, the practitioners are seeing very strong and healthy embryos being developed within the INVOcell and have equal or better clinical pregnancy and live birth results.

For the various markets, we price the INVOcell Intravaginal Culture System technology based on discussions with our advisory board of physicians and potential strategic partners, and reflect the innovative features of the device, the savings in physician’s laboratory fixed costs and the billings the physician will receive from patients to perform INVO.  Our goal is to have the INVO procedure offered to infertile couples as a lower cost alternative with comparable success rates to IVF.
INVOcell Culture Device:    For the U.S. market our price for the INVOcell and retention devices has been agreed to with Ferring. Ferring has minimum quantities that they must buy from the company on an annual basis in order to their exclusivity. In the international markets the price will be determined as we enter them based on current offerings and discussions with key partners. IVF centers or Ob/Gyn groups purchasing a large number of devices and promoting the INVO process may receive discounted prices and certain free advertising of their facility on our website.  It is expected that the INVOcell will sell for different prices throughout the world as a reflection of different economies and prices of the IVF procedure in different countries.
INVOcell Retention Device:  This is a single-use, modified diaphragm that includes holes to allow for natural drainage of vaginal fluids. The current model is an FDA cleared and CE Marked product purchased from a US company. This retention device currently sells for $70 each. In 2018 the Company developed its own single use lower cost product. This retention device specification is equivalent to the current modified diaphragm but will not be available for sale until the completion of testing before being accepted and released by INVO Bioscience for commercial sale. This will significantly reduce the cost of goods moving forward as well as the price to the physicians. 
 
Fixed Laboratory Equipment:  The equipment used in the INVO procedure (microscope with video system, bench centrifuge, incubator without CO2, bench warmer and laminar flow hood) is readily available in the market.  The complete set up for the INVO procedure currently costs approximately $125,000 in the U.S. and $150,000 if ICSI is included in the lab.

Sales Strategy
 
As of December 31, 2018, sales and marketing activities are being performed by the Company’s CEO and VP of Global Operations. We anticipate building an international sales team in 2019 and beyond, staring with the addition of Michael Campbell as our Chief Operating Officer and VP of Business Development who joined the Company in February 2019. Mr. Campbell was most recently the Vice President of IVF Americas Business Unit for Cooper Surgical, Inc. (CSI), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Cooper Companies (NYSE: COO), and is also a member of the board of directors for INVO Bioscience. Mr. Campbell has substantial medical device sales, marketing and business development leadership experience within Global Fortune 500 and Start-up Company environments.  During his over 12-year career at Cooper Surgical, he has been responsible for IVF product portfolio sales globally including the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific regions. Our sales efforts include the following three approaches:
Domestic - In the United States our sales will come from our relationship with Ferring Pharmaceuticals - The Company will initially ship bulk shipments to Ferring on a quarterly basis per volumes in the Supply Agreement and will adjust as needed to allow for the timely delivery of INVOcells to the physicians. Ferring’s strategy is to market to Reproductive Endocrinologist’s (REI’s) and OB/GYN’s to offer INVO in place of Inter-Uterine Insemination (IUI) since the overall expense for an actual pregnancy is less for INVO, as multiple cycles of IUI are typically required and still produce a very low pregnancy rate as compared to INVO.
Distributor Partnerships – In foreign countries, we have and will continue to establish local partnerships to access the countries’ markets.  With the distributor-to-physician model, the distributors will be selling to IVF centers, medical practices and physicians directly.  We will support the distributors’ efforts with training, both to the distributors’ trainers as well as to the physicians directly.   We will be expanding our international sales & marketing presence in 2019. 
 
Partnering with Doctors in opening centers that offer INVO as the primary reproductive service – We are looking to work with current doctors in areas of the US where there is demand but currently no IVF facilities. This approach may take many different forms all of which we are willing to explore. The Company plans to build five (5) centers in the United States in the coming years.
 
Target Markets
 
We expect to continue to launch in the international markets focusing on the Middle East, Mexico, Europe, India and Asia. We will also continue to work on regulatory submissions for key countries such as China.
Worldwide – According to ESHRE February 2018, one in six couples worldwide experience some form of infertility problem at least once during their reproductive lifetime. The current prevalence of infertility lasting for at least 12 months is estimated to be around 10% worldwide for women aged 20-44. In 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, almost 800,000 treatment cycles were reported from 39 European countries.  The global need for ART is estimated to be at least 1,500 cycles/million population per year.  With the global population of 7.5 billion, the estimate for infertility prevalence is 50 million couples.    
U.S. – According to The National Survey of Family Growth from the Centers for Disease Control, in the year 2016, Over 7.5 million women in the U.S. had difficulty conceiving (12.4%) With only about 760,000 couples receiving fertility treatment (IUI, IVF and other treatments). This leaves more than six million couples receiving no treatment at all for their infertility. According to the ASRM’s 2015 Access to Care Summit White Paper, the largest barrier to patients seeking treatment is the cost of the treatment and the lack of insurance coverage for the cost. We are currently offering the INVO procedure in the U.S. at $6,500 dollars per cycle inclusive of medications.  Our goal is to penetrate 5% of the currently untreated infertility market over the next few years, although no assurances can be made that we will achieve our goal in our target markets or at all.
Europe – ESHRE estimated in 2018 that Europe had approximately 10 million infertile couples, of which about 800,000 were estimated to have received ART treatments.  That would leave over 9 million infertile couples untreated.
 
Launching INVO in the U.S. market required U.S. FDA DeNovo clearance, which we received in November 2015. Our strategy was to focus our resources primarily on U.S. sales through 2018 to make INVO the standard of care in the United States. Currently, we are providing the INVO product and training at a low introductory price to doctors who are interested in offering the INVO Procedure at their practice. This approach appears to be successful, as there are currently 89 facilities offering or referring the INVO Procedure. As these doctors are adding our INVOcell device and procedure to their existing services it will take time for the INVO method to gain market traction. This is partially due to a portion of patients who are more comfortable using the more traditional and well-known infertility service approaches. On average, it appears the integration of the INVO method into physician’s practices takes approximately 6-9 months. We are taking steps to assist physicians who are having difficulty integrating the INVO method into their established practices.
 
In January 2019, INVO Bioscience closed an exclusive sales and marketing licensing deal with Ferring for the U.S. market. INVO Bioscience will continue to manufacture product for Ferring and the international market. 
 
FDA clearance is required in many countries before they will allow U.S. products to be registered in those countries. The FDA approval granted in 2015 will allow the INVO Bioscience to do regulatory registrations to sell and market INVO in countries such as Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, China and other countries in across the globe.

The CE Mark, which is currently being renewed, allows us to sell our INVO device in Europe and certain countries in South America and Africa, subject to local registration requirements.  Our strategy is to focus on these international markets while Ferring manages the U.S. Market. These areas are in need of less costly fertility treatments due to the economics and high infertility rates of up to 25% and relatively low availability of IVF procedures.
 
Insurance Reimbursement for Infertility Treatment
 
In the United States there is generally minimal insurance coverage for infertility treatments, and what coverage there is varies on a state by state basis. Fifteen (15) states mandate some form of insurance reimbursement for infertility treatment.  Three (3) states mandate reimbursement for IVF, while other states cover some form of infertility treatment, but they may also specifically exclude IVF due to cost. Some states have coverage for IUI and not IVF. Based on our new relationship with Ferring it will be up to them to determine if they would like to pursue this opportunity in the United States with the resources they have.
 
Under current fertility service insurance standards, many practices require an infertile patient have at least three IUI cycles before pursuing IVF. As a result, many patients are often referred to IVF when multiple IUI attempts are not successful. According to Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, in 2015 the pregnancy rate for each natural IUI cycle is approximately 4% to 5%, and in the event fertility drugs are used, the pregnancy rate increases to approximately 7% to 16%. In the future, we estimate third-party insurance payers could save more than $7,000 per pregnancy by requiring the patient to try INVOcell first.
 
Most European countries have some level of coverage for infertility treatment, but the level of coverage varies from country to country and even within countries.  For example, the National Health Service in the UK covers 20% of most costs for infertility treatment.  However, that standard is not applied universally throughout the UK and some counties provide almost no coverage.    In 2010, in Canada, the Province of Quebec mandated the full payment of up to 3 ART cycles for residents; however, in November of 2016 they stopped the program.
 
We believe that the INVOcell process will be treated favorably by as it lowers cost and has a high efficacy rate.  According to the data we have found the Company has determined based on the typical number of cycles it take to get pregnant, in the US, the average cost per pregnancy using IUI is $12,000 and IUI is only indicated for approximately 40% of the infertile population.  However, the INVOcell device, which based on the 450 clinical cycles submitted to the FDA in 2014 by the Company, has equivalent pregnancy rates as traditional IVF and treats the same indications as IVF therefore is a very effective treatment for a majority of infertile couples. 
 
Branding and Promotion
 
We have a logo associated with the INVOcell device that is refined for the infertility market.  We have trademarked “INVO Bioscience”, “INVOCELL” and “INVO”.  In 2016 we launched our new website. Our website now refers patients in the US to Ferring moving forward in 2019. We will continue to provide updated information to people looking for INVO in the U.S. to support Ferring and our own US and International efforts as well as the comprehensive FAQ section.  We are continuing to improve our website to include special pages for clinicians and patients.  Subject to available capital, the improvements will include materials that medical professionals and patients can print, including status reports and news items.  It would be expected to include training videos for potential customers, both physicians and patients, who want to learn exactly how the INVOcell works.
REGULATION
 
Domestic Regulations
 
The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally by the FDA in the U.S. and corresponding foreign agencies.  The FDA administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated there under.  We are subject to the standards and procedures with respect to the manufacture of medical devices and are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with such standards and procedures.  The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.  The INVOcell device and process secured a DeNovo Class II notification clearance in November 2015 to allow us to introduce them into the U.S. market.  
 
Every company that develops, manufactures or assembles medical devices is required to register with the FDA and adhere to certain “good manufacturing practices” in accordance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which regulates the manufacture of medical devices, prescribes record-keeping procedures and provides for the routine inspection of facilities for compliance with such regulations.  The FDA also has broad regulatory powers in the areas of clinical testing, marketing and advertising of medical devices.

Medical device manufacturers are routinely subject to periodic inspections by the FDA.  If the FDA believes that a company may not be operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the FDA and the Department of Justice can:
 

● | place the company under observation and re-inspect the facilities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | issue a warning letter apprising of violating conduct; 
● | detain or seize products; 
● | mandate a recall; 
● | seek to enjoin future violations; 
● | seek civil and criminal penalties against the company, its officers or its employees; and
● | issue a form 483 to initiate corrective actions by the company 

 
 INVO Bioscience has successfully completed two comprehensive inspections by the United States Food & Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) occurring in January 2012 and November 2014 resulting in no action indicated (NAI), meaning all was acceptable to the US FDA. The company will continue to be the manufacturer of the INVOcell in the US to support Ferring’s sales and marketing initiatives. This requires the company to continue its regulatory responsibilities and compliance activities.


International Regulations
 
We are subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries where our products are sold.  Many of the regulations applicable to our products in such countries are similar to those of the FDA.  The national health or regulatory organizations of certain countries require that our products be qualified before they can be marketed in those countries.  Many of the countries we are targeting do not have a formal approval process of their own but rely on either FDA clearance or the European approval, the CE mark.  Some countries require a registration process of listing the INVOcell with the governing body in addition to the United States and European approvals, the CE mark.
 
With CE marking, we have had, and when we receive re-certification we anticipate we will have, the necessary regulatory authority to distribute our product after registration in the European Economic Area (i.e., Europe, Australia, and New Zealand).  In addition, we have the ability to markets in some parts of the Middle East and South America as they do not have medical device regulations.  Every country has different requirements; we have completed registrations in some, are in process with others.  We continue to work with doctors and distributors submitting additional registrations.  Certain other countries require that we first receive FDA clearance.  In general, we are registering the product based on the size of the market and our ability to service it given our resources.
 
In 2009, INVO Bioscience received clearance from Health Canada to market, sell and train on the use of the INVOcell and INVO procedure in Canada. Although the Canadian government approved the INVOcell, in Canada the local physician’s college must authorize the use of new products in each province. These governing colleges also want to see the product approved in the country of origin before moving forward in Canada.  With the 2015 FDA approval, Effortless IVF, CA with the approval of the local physician’s college raised funds in 2016 to start building an INVO offering center in Calgary Canada; this center is currently operational and started treating patients in August 2017. An additional center in Canada is planned to launch in 2019. As with most new businesses, the center has been going through a learning curve and working out operational issues. The Team at Effortless IVF in Calgary is hoping to use the experience from this site to expand its reach across Canada and have already been working on their next locations.
 
In 2012 we received Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) clearance approving the sale and use of the INVOcell throughout Brazil.  The approval opens the door for INVO Bioscience to one of the largest markets and fastest growing economies in the world with over 190 million people.  In 2016 we completed a new registration and added an additional distribution channel which was approved by ANVISA in 2017. We look forward to targeting this opportunity in the near future.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company’s success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies. Our goal is to develop a strong intellectual property portfolio that enables us to capitalize on the research and development that we have performed to date and will perform in the future, particularly for each of the products that we commercialize such as the INVOcell. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trademark laws in the United States and other countries to obtain and maintain our intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property by, among other methods, filing patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts on inventions that are important to the development of our business.  
 
The Company’s product development process has resulted in the development of two active patents covering both the INVOcell device and the INVO Procedure.
 
The Company is currently in the process of completing process improvements on the INVOcell and INVO Procedure which we believe will allow us to patent these features to extend the device’s patent life.
