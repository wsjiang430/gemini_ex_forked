Item 1. Business
General
KBR, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "KBR" or "the Company") is a global provider of differentiated, professional services and technologies across the asset and program life-cycle within the government services and hydrocarbons industries. Our capabilities include research and development, feasibility and solutions development, specialized technical consulting, systems integration, engineering and design services, process technologies, highly specialized mission and logistics support solutions, program management, construction services, commissioning and startup services, asset operations and maintenance services. We provide these and other support services to a diverse customer base, including domestic and foreign governments, international and national oil and gas companies, oil refiners, petrochemical producers, fertilizer producers and specialty chemicals manufacturers. 
KBR, Inc., incorporated in the state of Delaware in March 2006, is a global company headquartered in Houston, Texas, USA, with offices around the world. We trace our history and culture to two businesses, The M.W. Kellogg Company ("Kellogg") and Brown & Root, Inc. ("Brown & Root"). Kellogg was founded in New York in 1901 and evolved into a technology and service provider for petroleum refining, petrochemicals processing and LNG. Brown & Root was founded in Texas in 1919, built the world’s first offshore platform in 1947 and grew into an international engineering and construction company. Brown & Root was acquired by Halliburton in 1962 and Kellogg was acquired by Halliburton in 1998 through its merger with Dresser Industries. KBR completed its separation from Halliburton in April 2007. Following a transformational restructuring in late 2014, and consistent with our new strategy, we made two substantial acquisitions in 2016 and another in early 2018 in the government services sector, which fundamentally and materially re-balanced our portfolio to a greater mix of long-term, cost reimbursable and synergistic professional services business base. This new business base, added to KBR’s existing portfolio, leverages our program and life-cycle management expertise across a much larger addressable market for greater diversification, more predictable results, expanded customer offerings and attendant growth opportunities.
Our Business
KBR is a leading global provider of full life-cycle professional services, project delivery and technologies supporting two verticals: Government and Hydrocarbons. We aim to execute our portfolio through long-term contracts that provide balanced and sustainable growth with an acceptable risk profile and predictable cash flows. Our key areas of strategic focus are as follows: 

• | Government Services: A wide range of professional services across defense, space and government embracing research and development, test and evaluation, program management and consulting, mission planning, operational and platform support, logistics and facilities, training and security. These services are mainly for governmental agencies in the U.S., U.K. and Australia and also cover other selective countries. These programs are frequently provided on long-term service contracts, with key scientific, technical and program management differentiation. Key customers include U.S. DoD agencies such as the Missile Defense Agency, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force as well as NASA, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, London Metropolitan Police, U.K. Army, other U.K. Crown Services, and the Royal Australian Air Force, Navy and Army.

Our Business Segments
Our business is organized into three core and two non-core business segments as follows:
Core business segments

• | Government Services


• | Technology


• | Hydrocarbons Services

Non-core business segments

• | Non-strategic Business


• | Other

Our business segments are described below.
Government Services. Our GS business segment provides full life-cycle support solutions to defense, space, aviation and other programs and missions for military and other government agencies in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. As program management integrator, KBR covers the full spectrum of defense, space, aviation and other government programs and missions from research and development; through systems engineering, test and evaluation, systems integration and program management; to mission planning, operations support, maintenance and field logistics. Our GS acquisitions, as described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, have been combined with our existing U.S. operations within this business segment and operate under the single "KBRwyle" brand.
Technology. Our Technology business segment combines KBR's proprietary technologies, equipment and catalyst supply and associated knowledge-based services into a global business for refining, petrochemicals, inorganic and specialty chemicals as well as gasification, syngas, ammonia, nitric acid and fertilizers. From early planning through scope definition, advanced technologies and project lifecycle support, KBR's Technology segment works closely with customers to provide the optimal approach to maximize their return on investment.
Hydrocarbons Services. Our HS business segment provides comprehensive project planning and program delivery capability globally. Our key capabilities leverage our operational and technical excellence as a global provider of EPC for onshore oil and gas; LNG/GTL; oil refining; petrochemicals; chemicals; fertilizers; offshore oil and gas (shallow-water, deep-water and subsea); floating solutions (FPUs, FPSO, FLNG & FSRU); maintenance services (via the “Brown & Root Industrial Services” brand); and consulting services provided under our three specialty consulting brands, Granherne, Energo and GVA.
Non-strategic Business. Our Non-strategic Business segment represents the operations or activities that we intend to exit upon completion of existing contracts. All Non-strategic Business segment projects are substantially complete. We continue to finalize project close-out and warranty activities and to negotiate the settlement of claims and various other matters associated with these projects.
Other. Our Other business segment includes corporate expenses and general and administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments above. 
 The markets we serve are highly competitive and for the most part require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel. A large number of companies are competing in the markets served by our business, including U.S. based companies such as CACI International, Inc., EMCOR Group, Inc., Fluor Corporation, Leidos Holdings, Inc., ManTech International Corporation, AECOM, Quanta Services Inc., Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC"), Booz Allen Hamilton and international-based companies such as Bechtel, Jacobs Engineering, McDermott, Chiyoda Corporation ("Chiyoda"), TechnipFMC, Worley-Parsons and Vectrus, Inc. Since the markets for our services are vast and extend across multiple geographic regions, we cannot make a definitive estimate of the total number of our competitors.
Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Transactions
Acquisitions
During the second quarter of 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of SGT, a leading provider of high-value engineering, mission operations, scientific and IT software solutions in the government services market, for an aggregate purchase price of $355 million, plus $10 million of working capital and other purchase price adjustments set forth in the purchase agreement. This acquisition is reported within our GS business segment.
Significant Joint Ventures and Alliances
We enter into joint ventures and alliances with other industry participants in order to capitalize on the strengths of each party and provide greater flexibility in delivering our services based on cost and geographical efficiency, increase the number of opportunities that can be pursued and reduce exposure and diversify risk. Clients of our HS business segment frequently require EPC contractors to work in teams given the size and complexity of global projects that may cost billions of dollars to complete. Our significant joint ventures and alliances are described below. All joint venture ownership percentages presented are stated as of December 31, 2018.
Aspire Defence is a joint venture currently owned by KBR and two financial investors to upgrade and provide a range of services to the British Army’s garrisons at Aldershot and around the Salisbury Plain in the U.K. We own a 45% interest in Aspire Defence that is accounted for within our GS business segment using the equity method of accounting. Prior to January 15, 2018, we held a 50% interest in the joint ventures that provide the construction and related support services to Aspire Defence, with the other 50% being owned by Carillion. On January 15, 2018, Carillion entered into compulsory liquidation and was excluded from future business and benefit from its interest in the joint ventures. As a result, KBR assumed operational management and control of these entities. KBR began consolidating the financial results of these entities in its financial statements effective January 15, 2018. On April 18, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Carillion's interests in the subcontracting entities as further discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.
In 2016, we established the Affinity joint venture between KBR and Elbit Systems to procure, operate and maintain aircraft, and aircraft-related assets over an 18-year contract period, in support of the UKMFTS project. KBR owns a 50% interest in Affinity.  In addition, KBR owns a 50% interest in the two joint ventures, Affinity Capital Works and Affinity Flying Services, which provide procurement, operations and management support services under subcontracts with Affinity. The investments are accounted for within our GS business segment using the equity method of accounting. 
We participate in the JKC joint venture with JGC and Chiyoda for the design, procurement, fabrication, construction, commissioning and testing of the Ichthys Onshore LNG export facility in Darwin, Australia. The project is being executed through two joint ventures in which we own a 30% interest. The investments are accounted for within our HS business segment using the equity method of accounting.
Brown & Root Industrial Services is a joint venture with BCP and offers maintenance services, turnarounds and small capital expenditure projects, primarily in North America. We own a 50% interest in this joint venture and account for this investment within our HS business segment using the equity method of accounting. 
Backlog of Unfulfilled Orders
Backlog is our estimate of the U.S. dollar amount of revenues we expect to realize in the future as a result of performing work on contracts. For projects within our unconsolidated joint ventures, we have included our percentage ownership of the joint venture’s estimated revenues in backlog to provide an indication of future work to be performed. Our backlog was $13.5 billion and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with approximately 22% and 68% related to work being executed by joint ventures accounted for on the equity method of accounting. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2018, 33% of our backlog will be recognized as revenues within fiscal 2019. For additional information regarding backlog see our discussion within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Contracts
Our contracts broadly consist of cost-reimbursable, fixed-price or “hybrid” contracts containing both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price scopes of work. Our fixed-price contracts may include cost escalation and other features that allow for increases in price should certain events occur or conditions change. Change orders on fixed-price contracts are routinely approved as work scopes change resulting in adjustments to our fixed price.
Cost-reimbursable contracts include contracts where the price is variable based upon our actual costs incurred for materials, equipment and for reimbursable labor hours. Profit on cost-reimbursable contracts may be in the form of a fixed fee or a mark-up applied to costs incurred or a combination of the two. The fee may also be an incentive fee based on performance indicators, milestones or targets. Cost-reimbursable contracts may also provide for a guaranteed maximum price where the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price. Cost-reimbursable contracts are generally less risky than fixed-price contracts because the owner/customer retains many of the project risks.
Our GS business segment primarily performs work under cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S. DoD, U.K. MoD and other governmental agencies that are generally subject to applicable statutes and regulations. If the government concludes costs charged to a contract are not reimbursable under the terms of the contract or applicable procurement regulations, these costs are disallowed or, if already reimbursed, we may be required to refund the reimbursed amounts to the customer. Such conditions may also include interest and other financial penalties. If performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the government retains the right to pursue remedies, which could include termination under any affected contract. Generally, our customers have the contractual right to terminate or reduce the amount of work under our contracts at any time. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Fixed-price and lump-sum contracts, including unit-rate contracts (essentially a fixed-price contract with the only variable being units of work to be performed), are for a fixed sum to cover all costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail significant risk to us because they require us to predetermine the work to be performed, the project execution schedule and all the costs associated with the work. Although fixed-price contracts involve greater risk than cost-reimbursable contracts, they also are potentially more profitable since the owner/customer pays a premium to transfer project risks to us.
Also within our GS business segment, we participate in PFIs contracts, such as the Aspire Defense and UKMFTS projects. PFIs are long-term contracts that outsource the responsibility for the construction, procurement, financing, operation and maintenance of government-owned assets to the private sector. The PFI projects in which KBR participates are primarily located in the U.K. and Ireland with contractual terms ranging from 15 to 35 years and involve the provision of services to various types of assets ranging from acquisition and maintenance of major military equipment and housing to transportation infrastructure. Under most of these PFI arrangements, the primary deliverables of the contracting entity are the initial provision of assets to the customer and the subsequent provision of operations and maintenance services related to the assets once they are ready for intended use through the remaining life of the arrangement. The amount of reimbursement from the customer to the contracting entity is negotiated on each contract and varies depending on the specific terms for each PFI. 
Significant Customers
We provide services to a diverse customer base, including: 

• | domestic and foreign governments;


• | international oil companies and national oil companies;


• | independent refiners;


• | petrochemical and fertilizer producers;


• | developers; and


• | manufacturers.

Within the past three years, we generated significant revenues from key U.S. government customers including U.S. DoD and NASA, and from the U.K government within our GS business segment. No other customers represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues in any of the periods presented. The information in the following table has summarized data related to our revenues from the U.S. government and U.K. government.

Revenues and percent of consolidated revenues attributable to major customers by year:
 | Years ended December 31,
Dollars in millions, except percentage amounts | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
U.S. government | $ | 2,610 | | 53 | % | $ | 1,914 | 46 | % | $ | 1,090 | 26 | %
U.K. government | $ | 622 | | 13 | % | $ | 66 | 2 | % | $ | 62 | 2 | %

Information relating to our customer concentration is described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also, see further explanations in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Equipment and materials essential to our business are obtained from a variety of sources throughout the world. The principal equipment and materials we use in our business are subject to availability and price fluctuations due to customer demand, producer capacity and market conditions. We monitor the availability and price of equipment and materials on a regular basis. Our procurement function seeks to leverage our size and buying power to ensure that we have access to key equipment and materials at the best possible prices and delivery schedules. While we do not currently foresee any significant lack of availability of equipment and materials in the near term, the availability of these items may vary significantly from year to year and any prolonged unavailability or significant price increases for equipment and materials necessary to our projects and services could have a material adverse effect on our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Intellectual Property
We have developed, acquired or otherwise have the right to license leading technologies, including technologies held under license from third parties, used for the production of a variety of petrochemicals and chemicals and in the areas of olefins, refining, fertilizers, coal gasification, semi-submersibles and specialty chemicals. We also license a variety of technologies for the transformation of raw materials into commodity chemicals such as phenol used in the production of consumer end products. In addition, we are a licensor of ammonia process technologies used in the conversion of natural gas to ammonia. We also offer technologies for crystallization and evaporation, as well as concentration and purification of strong inorganic acids. We believe our technology portfolio and experience in the commercial application of these technologies and related know-how differentiates us, enhances our margins and encourages customers to utilize our broad range of EPC and construction services.
Our rights to make use of technologies licensed to us are governed by written agreements of varying durations, including some with fixed terms that are subject to renewal based on mutual agreement. Generally, each agreement may be further extended and we have historically been able to renew existing agreements before they expire. We expect these and other similar agreements to be extended so long as it is mutually advantageous to both parties at the time of renewal. For technologies we own, we protect our rights, know-how and trade secrets through patents and confidentiality agreements.
Seasonality
Our operations are not generally affected by seasonality. However, weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 25,000 employees world-wide, of which approximately 7% were subject to collective bargaining agreements. In addition, our joint ventures employ approximately 11,000 employees. Based upon the geographic diversification of our employees, we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole.
Worker Health and Safety
We are subject to numerous worker health and safety laws and regulations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation, the Mine Safety and Health Administration laws, and safety requirements of the Departments of State, Defense, Energy and Transportation of the U.S. government. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including the U.K. where we are subject to the various regulations enacted by the Health and Safety Act of 1974.
These laws and regulations are frequently changing and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future. Our global Zero Harm initiative reinforces health, safety, security and environment as key components of the KBR culture and lifestyle.  This initiative incorporates three dynamic components: "Zero Harm", "24/7" and "Courage to Care," which empower individuals to take responsibility for their health and safety, as well as that of their colleagues. However, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will always be successful and from time to time we may experience accidents or unsafe work conditions may arise. Our project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. Additionally, our employees and others at certain project sites may be exposed to severe weather events or high security risks. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly work place for all of our employees and those who work with us. However, we may incur substantial costs to maintain the safety and security of our personnel in these locations.
Environmental Regulation
Our business involves the planning, design, program management, construction and construction management, and operations and maintenance at various project sites, including oil field and related energy infrastructure construction services in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Our operations may require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic or hazardous substances, which are subject to stringent and complex laws relating to the protection of the environment and prevention of pollution.
Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations, and some laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed. For example, there are a number of governmental laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and comparable national and state laws that impose strict, joint and several liabilities for the entire cost of cleanup, without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. In addition, some environmental regulations can impose liability for the entire clean-up upon owners, operators, transporters and other persons arranging for the treatment or disposal of such hazardous substances costs related to contaminated facilities or project sites. Other environmental laws applicable to our operations and the operations of our customers affecting us include, but are not limited to, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Occupational Safety and the Toxic Substances Control as well as other comparable foreign and state laws. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, comparable foreign and state laws or a failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial costs to us, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or cessation of remediation activities.
Additional information relating to environmental regulations is described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements, and the information discussed therein is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 1.
Compliance
Conducting our business with ethics and integrity is a key priority for KBR. We are subject to numerous compliance-related laws and regulations, including the U.S. FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, other applicable anti-bribery legislation and laws and regulations regarding trade and exports. The services we provide to the U.S. federal government are subject to the FAR, the Truth in Negotiations Act, CAS, the Services Contract Act and DoD security regulations, and many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. We are also governed by our own Code of Business Conduct and other compliance-related corporate policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws. Our Code of Business Conduct is a guide for every employee in applying legal and ethical practices to our everyday work. The Code of Business Conduct describes not only our standards of integrity but also some of the specific principles and areas of the law that are most likely to affect our business. We regularly train our employees regarding our Code of Business Conduct and other specific areas including anti-bribery compliance and international trade compliance.
