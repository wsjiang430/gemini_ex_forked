Our Business
Roper Technologies, Inc. (“Roper,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and software-as-a-service) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.
We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other businesses that offer high value-added software, services, engineered products and solutions that we believe are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche markets and believe we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in most of these markets.
We were incorporated on December 17, 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware.

These solutions are applied principally in nuclear energy markets. Many of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments.
The Energy Systems & Controls segment companies’ revenues reflect a combination of standard products and large engineered projects. Standard products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order, and large engineered projects may have lead times of several months. As such, backlog may fluctuate depending upon the timing of large project awards.
Materials and Suppliers
We believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world. However, some components and sub-assemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers. Some high-performance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply and/or suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications. We regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible, and we believe these conditions equally affect our competitors. Supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions.
Backlog
Our backlog includes only firm unfilled orders expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. Backlog was $1.69 billion at December 31, 2018, and $1.67 billion at December 31, 2017.
Distribution and Sales
Distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices, manufacturers’ representatives and distributors. In addition, our Medical & Scientific Imaging segment also sells through value added resellers (“VARs”) and OEMs.
Environmental Matters and Other Governmental Regulation
Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.
Customers
No customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues for 2018 for any of our segments or for our company as a whole.

Competition
Generally, our products and solutions face significant competition, usually from a limited number of competitors. We believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or small in size, often depending on the size of the niche market we serve. We compete primarily on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.
Patents and Trademarks
In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own or license the rights under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with, employees, distributors, representatives and customers to protect our trade secrets and know-how. We believe none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 15,611 employees, with 10,294 located in the United States. We have 195 employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
