Overview 
 
We are a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company developing proprietary antibody-based therapeutics to treat multiple human diseases. Our scientific focus is on the relationship between angiogenesis, the immune system, and tumor growth. Our pipeline of novel product candidates is designed to target multiple critical biological pathways required for an effective anti-tumor response. These include modulation of the microvasculature via angiogenesis-targeted agents, induction of a potent immune response via activators on effector cells in the tumor microenvironment, and alleviation of immunosuppressive mechanisms used by tumors to evade immune surveillance. We plan to advance our product candidates through clinical development as both standalone therapies and in combination with proprietary pipeline antibodies based on supportive clinical and nonclinical data.
 
Our pipeline is comprised of three product candidates. Our lead product candidate, CTX-009, is a bispecific antibody targeting Delta-like ligand 4 (“DLL4”), a ligand of Notch-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (“VEGF-A”). Simultaneous blockade of the VEGF-A and the Notch pathways is known to turn productive angiogenesis into non-productive angiogenesis, which leads to tumor shrinkage and apoptosis. Our second program CTX-471, is an agonistic antibody targeting a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9 (TNFRSF9), also known as CD-137, a co-stimulatory receptor which is mostly expressed on activated, but not on resting T-cells and NK cells. Our third program, CTX-8371, is a bispecific antibody targeting the programmed cell death protein-1 (“PD-1”), an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor and its ligand PD-L1, two validated immune-oncology targets.
 
CTX-009 is currently undergoing clinical studies as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in the United States, South Korea and China.  We currently have two open clinical trials with CTX-009 in the United States: A Phase 2 trial of CTX-009 as monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (“CRC”) who received two or three prior treatment regimens and a Phase 2/3 trial of CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with biliary tract cancer (“BTC”) who received one prior treatment regimen. In addition, a Phase 2 trial of CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with BTC who received one or two prior lines of treatment is ongoing in South Korea. The first stage of the Phase 2 South Korean trial is substantially complete and the data was reported at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (“ASCO GI”) Symposium in January 2023 and is summarized below. 
 
The two initial indications of BTC and CRC for CTX-009 were selected based on the results of the Phase 1,1b and 2 clinical trials and the significant unmet need for effective therapeutic regimens in these patient populations. There are an estimated 18,400 patients diagnosed with BTC in the U.S. each year and over 200,000 patients worldwide. BTC patients have a poor prognosis despite first line treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and no accepted standard of care in later treatment lines. For CRC, there are approximately 153,000 new patients diagnosed each year in the United States and more than 1.9 million patients worldwide. Despite advances in treatment of CRC in recent years with angiogenesis inhibitors and targeted therapies, there are few safe and effective treatment options for patients with CRC, and the majority of the patients are refractory to existing therapeutic regimens or relapse quickly and advance to later lines of therapy where treatment options are even more limited. We intend to expand the development of CTX-009 to additional tumor types with significant unmet need such as ovarian cancer and gastric cancer, among others. Following the generation of positive clinical data in later lines of therapy, we plan on studying CTX-009 in earlier settings in all of the indications where the data supports it.
 
CTX-471 is undergoing a two-part clinical trial. A Phase 1a trial of CTX-471 as monotherapy in patients with solid tumors who were previously treated with at least one checkpoint blocker and showed benefit for 3 months or more but ultimately progressed is fully enrolled and nearing completion. As of January 31, 2023, there are three patients remaining on treatment. In addition, a Phase 1b trial of CTX-471 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® in patients with selected solid tumors has begun in November 2022.This Phase 1b trial is currently enrolling and dosing patients in the dose-escalation portion of the study.

CTX-471 targets a key node of the immune system with the goal of identifying a next generation immune-oncology treatment for the majority of patients who do not have a sustained response to current therapies across a variety of cancers. During its early clinical development, CTX-471 demonstrated monotherapy activity in the post PD-1/PD-L1 patient population across three solid tumor indications: melanoma, small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. In the ongoing Phase 1b combination trial of CTX-471 with KEYTRUDA® we are looking to restore responses in patients who were previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor, initially responded but then progressed. The hypothesis we are testing is whether the addition of CTX-471 to KEYTRUDA® will restore responses in those patients. This trial is being conducted in patients with one of the following solid tumors: non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, melanoma, mesothelioma, and head and neck cancer. Restoration of meaningful responses in one or more of those indications can help shape the regulatory path for CTX-471.
 
Our third program, CTX-8371, is at a pre-clinical stage. We have recently completed GLP toxicology studies and we plan to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA in the first half of 2023. Once the IND is cleared, we will advance CTX-8371 to a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial.
 
CTX-8371 emerged from an unbiased screen conducted with our StitchMabsTM platform. We have subsequently tested CTX-8371 in several in vitro and in vivo models where it demonstrated enhanced activation of immune responses when compared with commercially available checkpoint blockers. We believe that CTX-8371 has a potential to become a next generation checkpoint inhibitor with improved activity across various solid tumors relative to commercially available checkpoint blockers. Additionally, we are in the process of preclinically evaluating proprietary combination regimens of CTX-8371 with our other product candidates, CTX-009 and CTX-471.

Pipeline 
 
The figure below details our pipeline of product candidates: CTX-009, CTX-471 and CTX-8371.
 


Our Strategy 
 
Our scientific focus is on the relationship between angiogenesis, the immune system, and tumor growth. Our pipeline of novel product candidates is designed to target multiple critical biological pathways required for an effective anti-tumor response. Our strategy to achieve this goal includes:

● | Advance our product candidate, CTX-009 (DLL4 x VEGF-A bispecific), through clinical development to drug approval in multiple indications, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies. CTX-009 is an investigational bispecific antibody that simultaneously blocks DLL4 and VEGF-A signaling pathways, which are critical to angiogenesis and tumor vascularization. We chose BTC and CRC as our first indications based on a number of factors, including CTX-009 activity observed in the Phase 1, 1b and 2 clinical trials and lack of effective therapies for these patient populations in the targeted lines of therapy. We have initiated a Phase 2 trial of CTX-009 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and a Phase 2/3 trial of CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with BTC. Additionally, we intend to explore the potential of CTX-009 in other indications where the data supports its potential therapeutic benefit such as ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer, liver cancer, neuroendocrine cancer and more. We are also developing a plan to study the combination of CTX-009 with our other product candidates, CTX-8371 and CTX-471.

● | Advance our product candidate, CTX-471 (CD137 agonist), through clinical development to evaluate its therapeutic potential alone and in combination with other therapies, and define a regulatory pathway for approval. We seek to translate the antitumor activity of CTX-471 observed in preclinical testing and in our Phase 1 trial into meaningful clinical results in patients with solid tumors, such as small cell lung cancer ("SCLC"), mesothelioma and melanoma. Our first Phase 1a clinical trial was conducted in patients who relapsed or progressed after at least three months of stable disease on prior checkpoint therapies. This trial is nearing completion and as of January 31, 2023 has three patients remaining on trial. Additionally, in November 2022, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1b trial of CTX-471 in combination with KEYTRUDA®. This trial is enrolling patients with metastatic or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, and head and neck cancer that have progressed after treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. Patients enrolled in the trial will be treated with CTX-471 in combination with KEYTRUDA® with the goal of restoring response.

● | Advance CTX-8371 (PD-1 x PD-L1 bispecific) into clinical development as a next generation checkpoint inhibitor. CTX-8371, our bispecific inhibitor that targets PD-1 and PD-L1, has demonstrated higher antitumor activity in preclinical experiments than a single PD-1, a single PD-L1, or combinations of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. IND-enabling studies, including GLP toxicology studies have been completed. Our goal is to submit an IND application in the first half of 2023 and advance CTX-8371 into first-in-human study in the second half of 2023. If successful, we could deliver early safety and top-line data in the first half of 2024.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seek strategic partnerships for select product candidates. Our technology platform is designed to generate a broad pipeline of product candidates with high potential for clinical application. We intend to assess on a case-by-case basis the opportunities for accelerating the preclinical and clinical development of these candidates in a capital-efficient manner, including selectively pursuing strategic partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies with domain-specific clinical development expertise to maximize the value of our pipeline.

Product Candidates
 
We currently have two product candidates in the clinical stage of development: CTX-009 and CTX-471. In addition, our third program, CTX-8371, is expected to be in the clinic in the second half of 2023.
 
CTX-009
 
CTX-009 (a.k.a. ABL001) is an investigational bispecific antibody that is designed to simultaneously block DLL4 and VEGF-A signaling pathways, which are critical to angiogenesis and tumor vascularization. Preclinical and early clinical data of CTX-009 as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy suggest that blockade of both pathways provides robust anti-tumor activity across several solid tumors, including colorectal, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer.
 
CTX-009 is undergoing clinical development in patients with advanced solid tumors in the United States, South Korea and China. A Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion monotherapy trial in patients with solid tumors and a Phase 1b trial of CTX-009 in combination with chemotherapy were completed in South Korea. In addition, a Phase 2 trial of CTX-009 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer is ongoing in South Korea. The first part of the Phase 2 trial has recently been completed and data from that study were presented at ASCO GI in January 2023.
 
We currently have two open clinical trials in the United States: a Phase 2 trial of CTX-009 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and a Phase 2/3 trial of CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.
 
We have licensed exclusive global rights to CTX-009, outside of South Korea, from ABL Bio, Inc. (“ABL Bio”), a South Korea-based clinical-stage company focused on developing antibody therapeutics. South Korean rights are held by Handok Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Handok”) and China rights were out-licensed from the Company to Elpiscience Biopharmaceuticals Co., Limited (“Elpiscience”).

Phase 1: Monotherapy Clinical Trial of CTX-009
 
An open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion trial designed to identify the optimal dose and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (“PK”), pharmacodynamics and the anti-tumor activity of CTX-009 in patients with advanced solid tumors after failure of standard of care treatment was conducted by ABL Bio in South Korea. This trial consisted of a Phase 1a monotherapy dose escalation arm and a Phase 1b dose expansion arm. The trial was initiated in September 2017 and enrollment was completed in February 2021.
 
The dose escalation portion of the trial followed a traditional 3+3 dosing scheme where CTX-009 was administered by intravenous infusion across nine dose cohorts ranging from 0.3 to 17.5 mg/kg biweekly. Patients were enrolled in two arms: a Phase 1a dose escalation arm and a Phase 1b dose expansion arm. The expansion cohorts were 7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 mg/kg. Patient tumor volumes were measured using CT scans at baseline and then every eight weeks.
 
Patient Demographics. A total of 45 patients were enrolled in the trial with advanced solid tumors that had been heavily pretreated, with a median of four prior lines of therapy. The median age of the patients was 53 years old and 54% of the patients were male and 46% female. Importantly, 75% of the patients had been previously dosed with anti-VEGF therapy. Most patients enrolled in the trial had either advanced colorectal cancer or advanced gastric cancer.
Safety Data Summary. A total of 45 patients were enrolled in the trial and received at least one dose of CTX-009. The dose escalation portion of the trial took place without interruption, and the highest dose arm was 17.5 mg/kg. Importantly, the maximal tolerated dose has not been determined in this trial. CTX-009 was observed to be generally well-tolerated.
 
There were 44 Treatment Related Adverse Events (“TRAEs”) observed in more than 5% of the 45 patients enrolled. The most prominent TRAE was hypertension, which was observed in 37.8% of the patients. Grade 3 or higher TRAEs observed in over 5% of the patients include a total of 11 Grade 3 events, the most frequent being hypertension observed in 15.6% of the patients, followed by gastrointestinal disorders, observed in 4.4% of the patients, followed by general disorders and nervous system disorders, observed in 2.2% of the patients each. A summary of the TRAEs observed in over 5% of the patients is depicted in the table below.
 

Treatment-related adverse events observed in > 5% of patients | Total (n) | | Total (%) | | Grade 3 (n) | Grade 3 (%)
--------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+----+-----------+------+-------------+------------
Hypertension* | | 17 | | 37.8 | | 7 | 15.6
General disorders (fatigue, fever, asthenia, edema, etc.) | | 7 | | 15.6 | | 1 | 2.2 
Nervous system disorders (headache, dizziness) | | 7 | | 15.6 | | 1 | 2.2 
Gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, etc.) | | 6 | | 13.3 | | 2 | 4.4 
Pulmonary hypertension | | 4 | | 8.9 | | 0 | 0 
Proteinuria | | 3 | | 6.7 | | 0 | 0 

 
* Hypertension is a well-known side effect of anti-VEGF blockers. In clinical trials of bevacizumab, incidence of Grade 3-4 hypertension ranged between 5%-18% (as indicated in the label). Hypertension is typically managed by anti-hypertensive drugs.
 
Activity Data Summary. A total of 40 out of the 45 patients enrolled in the trial were evaluable for the purpose of determination of anti-tumor activity of CTX-009 since five patients did not reach their first scan at week eight due to progressive disease ("PD") or for other reasons. Responses started to emerge at the 10 mg/kg dose level. Sixteen of the 40 evaluable patients were dosed at the 10 or 12.5 mg/kg dose levels, which represent what we project to be the efficacious dose levels. Among those 16 patients, there were three partial responses ("PRs") confirmed by RECIST 1.1 with an overall response rate ("ORR") of 18.8% and eight patients with stable disease (“SD”), with a clinical benefit rate ("CBR") of 68.8%. Two of the three PRs were in advanced colorectal patients and one of the three PRs was in an advanced gastric cancer patient. In addition, one of the patients with gastric cancer had a 35% decline in tumor mass relative to baseline. However, that regression was not confirmed upon a second CT scan, and hence not included in the ORR, and the best response of this patient included in the data set is stable disease. The average time to progression (“TTP”) of the advanced colorectal cancer patients treated at the 10 or 12.5 mg/kg was 6.7 months, and the average TTP of the advanced gastric cancer patients treated at the 10 or 12.5 mg/kg was 3.9 months.

Phase 1b: Combination Clinical Trial of CTX-009
 
An open-label, combination Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety, PK, anti-tumor activity and the recommended Phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) of CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel or irinotecan chemotherapy was conducted by ABL Bio and Handok in South Korea. This trial was initiated in June 2020, enrollment was completed in December 2020, and the trial was completed in November 2021 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04492033).
 
The trial includes two cohorts, each of which is divided into two groups. The first cohort was administered 10 or 12.5 mg/kg of CTX-009 on a biweekly basis, in combination with 80 mg/m2 paclitaxel administered weekly. The second cohort was administered 10 or 12.5 mg/kg of CTX-009 in combination with 150 mg/m2 irinotecan on a biweekly basis.
 
Patient Demographics. A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the trial. Patients enrolled in the trial were heavily pretreated, and the trial included patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric and other cancers with a median of three prior lines of therapy.
Safety Data Summary. In general, CTX-009 was observed to be well-tolerated. Adverse Events (“AEs”) that were determined to be probably or possibly related to CTX-009 treatment included Grade 3 hypertension observed in four patients (24%). Other AEs observed were Grade 3 neutropenia (12%), Grade 3 anemia (18%) and Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (12%), which were all attributed to the concomitant chemotherapy agent (paclitaxel or irinotecan). Pulmonary hypertension was monitored carefully in the trial via measurement of BNP levels and echocardiograms, and there were five Grade 1 pulmonary hypertension events, all of which resolved.

*Labeled Grade 3/4 cytopenia events for concomitant chemotherapy agent:
 Irinotecan: 31.4% neutropenia, 4.5% anemia, 1.7% thrombocytopenia
 Paclitaxel: 52% neutropenia, 16% anemia, 7% thrombocytopenia
 
Activity data summary. Of the 17 patients enrolled, there were four PRs, including three PRs that were confirmed by RECIST 1.1 and one PR which was unconfirmed, representing a 23.5% ORR and nine patients with SD, representing a CBR of 76.5%. The unconfirmed PR was in a patient with NSCLC who was on the trial for over a year with a measurable tumor decline. Of the four patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma enrolled in the trial, there were two PRs confirmed by RECIST 1.1 with 41% and 62% declines in tumor burden, respectively, representing an ORR in cholangiocarcinoma of 50%. A third patient with cholangiocarcinoma had stable disease with 28% decline in the patient’s tumor burden, and therefore the CBR observed in cholangiocarcinoma is three out of four, or 75%. The responses in cholangiocarcinoma were particularly durable with a median duration of response, or DOR, of 9.7 months.

Phase 1: Summary of Clinical Activity of CTX-009 at the RP2D
 
The observed ORR of CTX-009 at the 10 and 12.5 mg/kg doses were 18.8% (3/16) as a monotherapy and 23.5% (4/17) in combination with chemotherapy. The CBR of CTX-009 at the 10 and 12.5 mg/kg were 68.8% (11/16) as a monotherapy and 76.5% (13/17) in combination with chemotherapy.
 
On October 8, 2021, we, along with ABL Bio, presented clinical trial data from the CTX-009 Phase 1a/1b dose escalation and dose expansion trial at a plenary oral session during the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (Abstract Number: 4749; Session title: Plenary Session 2: New Drugs on the Horizon I). The significant findings presented were as follows:
 

● | CTX-009 was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated single agent activity in heavily pre-treated patients with solid tumors that are resistant to anti-VEGF therapies, mostly of colorectal and gastric origins
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) was not reached, and the RP2D of CTX-009 were determined to be 10.0 and 12.5 mg/kg biweekly
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ORR of CTX-009 as a monotherapy across all doses tested (0.3 – 17.5 mg/kg) was 8% and the CBR was 62% in patients treated at the 3rd and 4th line settings
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment with CTX-009 as a monotherapy at the RP2D (10.0 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg) led to 18.8% (n=3/16) ORR, not including an additional unconfirmed PR, and a 68.5% CBR (n=11/16)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Phase 2: Data from Combination Clinical Trial of CTX-009 in BTC in South Korea
 
A Phase 2 trial of CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel was initiated by Handok in the first quarter of 2021 in patients with BTCs. The study is being conducted at four leading medical centers in Seoul, South Korea, and is nearing completion. The trial enrolled patients with unresectable advanced, metastatic, or relapsed BTCs who had received one or two prior systemic therapies.
 
This Phase 2 trial utilizes a Simon Two-Stage adaptive design where the criteria to advance to the second stage of the trial was three PRs observed in 21 evaluable patients. As of November 9, 2022, in the preliminary analysis of all 24 patients participating in the study, CTX-009 with paclitaxel demonstrated a 37.5% ORR based on 9 patients with Partial Responses (“PRs”) that were confirmed by RECIST 1.1. The trial has met the criteria to advance to Part 2 and Part 1 of the study is mostly complete.
 
    14 

  

As of November 9, 2022, there was one patient remaining on treatment.  The results of Part 1 of the Phase 2 trial were presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (“ASCO GI”) in January 2023.
 
Safety Data Summary
 
As of November 9, 2022, safety data has been analyzed and CTX-009 was observed to be generally well-tolerated. The Phase 2 safety data are generally consistent with the safety data of the Phase 1 trials. Of the 24 patients enrolled in the first stage of the trial, all patients had at least one treatment emergent adverse event (“TEAE”). Grade 3 or greater TEAEs were reported in 95.8% of patients regardless of the relationship to CTX-009 or paclitaxel, including decreased neutrophil count (83.3%), hypertension (16.7%), anemia (20.8%), and decreased platelet count (12.5%). Grade 3 or greater adverse events that were designated to be of special interest (“AESIs”) by the trial investigators were hemoptysis or hemorrhage (12.5%) and GI or tumor perforation (8.3%), with 0% for pulmonary hypertension, wound healing complication and cardiac failure.
 
The table below depicts a summary of the TEAEs in 24 patients as of November 9, 2022.

Activity Data Summary
 
The first stage of the trial has enrolled 24 patients and 22 of those patients are considered evaluable.
 
Nine PRs confirmed by RECIST 1.1 have been observed leading to an ORR of 37.5%, and 22 of the 24 patients evaluated have had stable disease or better with a decline in tumor burden leading to a CBR of 92%. PRs were observed in all four tumor sub-types types (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and ampullary carcinoma). Of the 24 patients, 11 were treated in the second line with 7 PRs observed, leading to an ORR of 63.6% in this sub-group. In the third line, 13 patients were treated with 2 PRs observed, leading to an ORR of 15.4% in the second sub-group.
 
After a median follow up of approximately 12 months, the median progression free survival (“PFS”) was 9.4 months, median duration of response (“DOR”) was 6.9 months and median overall survival (“OS”) was 12.5 months. 
 
For reference, one regimen that has been studied in patients with advanced BTC is FOLFOX, the regimen recommended in the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for patients with BTC treated in the second-line setting. FOLFOX demonstrated a median PFS of 4.0 months and a median OS of 6.2 months in a randomized study against best supportive care.

Status of CTX-009 Development
 
Our strategy is to develop CTX-009 in all of the indications in which patients have a need for effective and novel therapeutic agents and data supports the potential therapeutic benefit of CTX-009. We chose BTC and CRC as our lead indications based on a number of factors, including CTX-009 activity observed in the Phase 1, 1b and 2 clinical trials, lack of effective therapies for these patient populations in the targeted lines of therapy and the potential for a straight-forward regulatory route to approval.
 
We submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in December 2021 for CTX-009 and the FDA cleared our IND application in January 2022. The following trials are being conducted in the United States under this IND.

Biliary Tract Cancers – BTC 
 
Following conversations with the FDA, we submitted a protocol for a randomized Phase 2/3 trial for CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel in adult patients with unresectable, advanced, metastatic or recurrent biliary tract cancers who have received one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen. The trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of CTX-009 and paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone. A schema of the trial design is provided below:
 



The trial will enroll 150 patients, who will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive CTX-009 plus paclitaxel (n=100) or paclitaxel alone (n=50). The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR and the secondary endpoints include PFS, DCR, DOR and OS among other. The trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier NCT 05506943).
 
We have opened several clinical sites and are currently recruiting patients for this trial. Dependingon the trial results, this trial could serve as a registrational trial to support a biologics license application ("BLA") submission for CTX-009 in combination with paclitaxel as a treatment of BTC patients in the second line setting.  Based on the trial results, a BLA could be filed as early as the second half of 2024.
 
Colorectal Cancer – CRC 
 
We submitted a protocol to the FDA for a Phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of CTX-009 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have received two or three prior systemic therapies. A schema of the trial design is provided below:
 


The trial utilizes a Simon Two-Stage adaptive design where the criteria to advance to the second stage of the trial is three PRs observed in 37 patients enrolled in Part A of the trial. Based on the Simon Two-Stage design, when the criteria for the first stage is met, the trial progresses to the second stage, at which time 47 additional patients will be enrolled. The trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT 05513742).   
 
In January 2023, the first patient was dosed in this trial. Initial results from this trial may be available in the second half of 2023.
 
Additional Plans for CTX-009
 
We intend to explore the potential of CTX-009 in additional indications, based on data from pre-clinical models, potential biomarkers such as DLL4, and clinical data from CTX-009 trials providing signs of potential activity of CTX-009 in additional indications such as ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer, liver cancer, neuroendocrine cancer and others.
 
In addition, we are developing a plan to study the combination of CTX-009 with our novel bispecific checkpoint blocker, CTX-8371, and with other checkpoint blockers, such as pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Additionally, we are considering the combination of CTX-009 with our novel CD137 agonistic antibody, CTX-471, which is currently in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors.

CTX-471
 
CTX-471, our monoclonal antibody product candidate, is a fully human, IgG4 monoclonal antibody that is an agonist of CD137, a key co-stimulatory receptor on immune cells. Binding of CTX-471 to CD137 has been observed to lead to ligand-stimulated activation of T-cells and NK cells. In treated mice, dosing with CTX-471 led to extensive reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment, including increased recruitment of immune cells, reversion of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, reductions in immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and reductions in immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages. Long after the completion of the treatment with CTX-471, a period described as eight half-lives of the antibody, treated mice exhibited immune memory that prevented reestablishment of the same tumor.
 
The CD137 antigenic site recognized by CTX-471 does not block the binding of CD137 ligand and is differentiated from the site recognized by CD137 antibodies from competitors. We designed the antibody using different backbones and chose to use a human IgG4 backbone for CTX-471 to enable engagement of Fc receptors FcgRI and FcgRIIb to facilitate CD137 cross-linking while avoiding binding to FcgRIIIa and depletion of immune effector cells through ADCC.
 
Immune cell depletion experiments showed that the activity of CTX-471 required the presence of CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and NK cells, indicating a coordinated involvement of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Encouragingly, treatment of tumors in mice with CTX-471 led to a marked reprogramming of the immune component of the tumor microenvironment. We also observed that tumors treated with CTX-471 had an approximate two-fold reduction in the number of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages.
 
In addition, we have observed potent activity in other syngeneic tumor models including tumor eradication in the A20 model of lymphoma, the MC38 model of colon carcinoma and in the EMT6 model of breast cancer.
 
We believe that the ability of CTX-471 to transform the tumor microenvironment through the combined action of immune cell recruitment, alleviation of T-cell exhaustion, suppression of Tregs, and reduction of tumor suppressing macrophages leads to CTX-471’s antitumor activity in mouse models.
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of CTX-471 
 
We are conducting a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human trial of CTX-471 administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) in patients with metastatic or locally advanced malignancies that have progressed while receiving an approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. We selected this population of patients for this trial because multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that not all patients respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapy due to many possible factors. By focusing on those that did previously respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, we believe that this trial design enriches for patients who have tumors that are capable of being recognized and killed by their immune systems. We believe that disease progression after the initial checkpoint inhibitor response is likely due to an increase in immunosuppressive activity that CTX-471 has the potential to overcome. The trial is being conducted with two treatment arms, the Monotherapy Arm and the Combination Arm. Each arm will have two parts: a dose escalation cohort and a dose expansion cohort. The Monotherapy Arm is nearing completion and enrollment began in the Combination Arm in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 
This Phase 1 trial is an open-label multiple ascending dose, dose escalation trial. After a period of 28 days to allow checkpoint inhibitors and other drugs to be eliminated from the body, each patient receives CTX-471 by intravenous infusion every two weeks either alone or in combination with pembrolizumab (IV) infusion 400 mg every six weeks. Disease progression is measured by CT scans every eight weeks. We collect blood samples to assess standard safety biomarkers as well as cytokines and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Baseline tumor biopsies are also collected for retrospective analyses.
 
    19 

  

The primary objective of the dose escalation stage of the trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of CTX-471 monotherapy at various doses alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The goal of the dose expansion stage is to determine an optimized dose for future clinical trials. Secondary endpoints include measures of overall response rate and progression-free survival, among others.
 
Dosing Strategy 
 
In contrast to dosing strategies for other immuno-oncology antibodies, such as checkpoint inhibitors where the goal is often to deliver a dose that is capable of fully inhibiting the receptor at all times, our dose selection for this trial is aimed at binding to only a fraction of the available CD137 receptors. Dosing of an agonist antibody, such as CTX-471, at levels capable of binding to the majority of receptors can lead to inappropriate cell activation and downregulation of the receptor and overall weaker activity.
 
Agonist antibodies typically trigger their activity through independent binding of each of their two antigen-binding domains to individual receptors on a cell surface. This binding to both receptors at once forces the receptors into close physical proximity. This grouping of receptors that drives receptor activation, especially when the ratio of antibody molecules to receptor molecules is relatively low. As the ratio of antibody to receptor increases, the level of receptor activation increases up to a point above which activation may decrease due to down-regulation of the receptors. This results in a bell-shaped activation curve in which maximal activation occurs at intermediate antibody concentrations.
 
We observed evidence of the importance of lower receptor occupancy while screening candidate antibodies against CD137. The antibodies with the greatest tumor-killing activity were the ones with intermediate potency. Very high-potency antibodies had weaker antitumor activity.
 
Consistent with the finding of lower activity at high antibody to receptor levels, we observed that the antitumor activity of CTX-471 appeared to peak at doses between 50 ug and 100 ug in the mouse CT26 tumor model. At the higher dose of 200 ug, the number of complete responses, four out of eight mice, was less than that observed at 100 ug, seven out of eight mice, suggesting that the optimal receptor occupancy had been exceeded. This is also consistent with our observation that intermediate affinity antibodies exhibited greater antitumor activity compared to high affinity antibodies.
 


Antitumor activity of CTX-471 is optimized at intermediate dose and decreased at the highest dose level
 
Our findings are consistent with those reported for an agonist antibody against OX40, another immune target in oncology. Thus, for many agonist antibodies, it is likely that both intermediate affinities and intermediate doses will deliver optimal activity.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial Data

In July 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of CTX-471 as a monotherapy in patients with solid tumors who were previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors and subsequently relapsed or progressed after a period of stable disease. The design of this trial includes a dose escalation stage followed by a dose expansion stage. The dose-escalation stage of the Phase 1 monotherapy (Phase 1a monotherapy) has been completed and CTX-471 was observed to be generally well-tolerated. The dose expansion stage of the monotherapy trial (Phase 1b monotherapy) is currently ongoing and nearing completion.
Phase 1: Dose Escalation – Monotherapy Arm
 
In the Phase 1a dose escalation stage, 19 patients received CTX-471 in the four dosing cohorts set forth in Figure 8 below.
 

 | Cohort 1 | Cohort 2 | Cohort 3 | Cohort 4 | 
---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------
Cohort | 0.1 mg/kg | 0.3 mg/kg | 0.6 mg/kg | 1.2 mg/kg | Total
Enrolled | 3 | 3 | 6 | 7 | 19 

 
The number of patients dosed with CTX-471 in the Phase 1a dose escalation stage 
 
CTX-471 was observed to be generally well-tolerated in the Phase 1a stage of the trial. There were two serious adverse events (“SAEs”) determined to be treatment-related, which included one hypoxia event that resolved with approximately one day of supplemental oxygen therapy and one immune thrombocytic purpura event that also resolved. The dose-limiting toxicities were two events of thrombocytopenia in Cohort 4, which was expanded from three to six patients to collect additional safety data. Based on these results, 0.6 mg/kg was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose.
 
While the goal of the Phase 1a stage of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CTX-471, we also collected data from these patients to evaluate the PK of CTX-471, the potential development of anti-drug antibodies of CTX-471, and to obtain certain efficacy data, based on the ORR, as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, RECIST. Patients who were enrolled in the Phase 1a stage of the trial have been evaluated every eight weeks by imaging techniques, such as MRI or CT, until disease progression or withdrawal from the trial, in order to collect such data.
 
The Phase 1a stage of the trial is now complete. None of the patients enrolled in the Phase 1a stage of the trial had a complete response or a partial response by RECIST. The best overall response has been stable disease. Two patients with NSCLC had stable disease until progression at Weeks 25 and 41, respectively. In addition, one patient with metastatic melanoma of mucosal origin had an approximately 24% decline in the total size of his measured metastatic tumors (target lesions) at week 33. This patient remained on the trial and received CTX-471 for 49 weeks.
 
We have analyzed preliminary PK data from the trial and these data have confirmed our receptor occupancy modeling. Based on this modeling and the correlation of the observed PK with our predictions, we selected 0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg as the doses of the cohorts of our Phase 1b stage of the trial. We estimate that a dose of 0.3 mg/kg would lead to a peak receptor occupancy of approximately 50% and a dose of 0.6 mg/kg would lead to a peak receptor occupancy of approximately 70%.
 
Phase 1: Dose Expansion – Monotherapy Arm
 
The dose expansion stage of the trial is nearing completion, and as of January 31, 2023, there are three ongoing patients in the trial. 60 patients with 18 different cancers have been enrolled in the trial and all of those patients are evaluable. Four patients had a PR; three of the four have been confirmed by RECIST 1.1 and the fourth PR is unconfirmed and will remain unconfirmed. There have been nine SAEs related to CTX-471 in the dose expansion stage of the trial. All nine events resolved.
 
    21 

  

The first PR observed in the trial was in a patient with advanced small cell lung cancer who was previously treated with carboplatin/etoposide and atezolizumab (a PD-L1 blocker) regimen at the first line followed by a treatment with nivolumab (a PD-1 blocker) in the second line. After progression on prior regimens this patient joined CTX-471 trial and had a PR at week 17 which was confirmed at week 25. This patient has now been dosed with CTX-471 for more than two years with a sustained and durable PR. Below is a series of CT scan images from this patient of the largest mass (RUL Lung) which was ~4 cm at baseline.
 


In October 2021, a second PR was observed in a patient with metastatic melanoma who was previously treated with nivolumab and progressed on nivolumab. Below is a series of CT scan images from this patient. The patient had multiple metastases at baseline and has reached PR based on a 38% decline in linear tumor burden at week nine. This PR was confirmed at week 17.
 


In December 2021, a third PR was observed in a patient with metastatic melanoma of mucosal origin who was previously treated with first-line regimen of ipilimumab plus nivolumab followed by second-line nivolumab as a monotherapy. After progressing on the prior regimens, the patient had joined CTX-471 trial with multiple metastases at baseline. This patient reached a PR based on a 58% decline in linear tumor burden at week 17. This PR was not confirmed.
 
In July 2022, we observed a fourth PR in the ongoing Phase 1b monotherapy trial of CTX-471 in a patient with mesothelioma. This response has also been confirmed.
 
Phase 1: Dosing - Combination Arm
 
In October 2022, we announced a clinical collaboration with Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) to evaluate CTX-471 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Compass is the study sponsor and Merck provides the clinical supply of KEYTRUDA®. Additionally, we formed a joint development committee (JDC) with Merck to review the results of this clinical trial.
 
In November 2022, we announced the first patient was dosed in the combination arm of the Phase 1 trial. This Combination Arm is enrolling patients with metastatic or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, mesothelioma and head and neck cancer that have progressed after treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. Patients enrolled in the trial will be treated with CTX-471 in combination with pembrolizumab with the goal of restoring response.  We expect the first interim data readout from the trial in the second half of 2023.

Development Plans for CTX-471
 
The results of the monotherapy and combination arms of the Phase 1 trial will inform us on the next development steps.
 
CTX-8371

CTX-8371 is a bispecific antibody that binds to both PD-1 and PD-L1, the targets of well-known and widely used checkpoint inhibitor antibodies. Preclinical studies demonstrate that CTX-8371 has the ability to outperform PD-1, PD-L1, and combinations of the two to activate T-cells in in vitro assays. In mouse xenografts, treatment with CTX-8371 led to significantly greater tumor growth control and longer survival than treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor alone, a PD-L1 inhibitor alone or the combination of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. IND-enabling studies on CTX-8371, including GLP toxicology studies in non-human primates (“NHPs”) were completed in the first quarter of 2023.
 


CTX-8371 is a PD-1 x PD-L1 bispecific antibody 
 
Overview of PD-1 and PD-L1 Checkpoint Inhibitors 
 
PD-L1 is a surface protein that is overexpressed by over 35% of certain types of cancer, such as melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and NSCLC. Binding of PD-L1 to its receptor, PD-1, on immune T-cells leads to suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells preventing immune attack of the tumor. Multiple inhibitors of PD-1 and PD-L1 have been approved as therapies for a broad range of tumors including melanoma, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer; gastric cancer, cervical cancer; and other cancers with microsatellite instability or mismatch repair deficiency. While PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint therapies have resulted in remarkable clinical efficacy across multiple cancer types, their efficacy, even in tumors with high immunogenicity, is limited to approximately 20% of patients. Nevertheless, sales of checkpoint therapies in 2021 were estimated to be $31 billion and expected to reach $148 billion by 2030 with a compounded average growth rate of 18.8% between 2020 and 2030. There is no approved therapy that combines inhibition of both PD-1 and PD-L1 in the same molecule.
 
    23 

  

Discovery and Preclinical Activity for CTX-8371 
 
The desire to improve the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has sparked multiple attempts to create bispecific antibodies in which one antigen binding site targets PD-1 or PD-L1 and the other targets immuno-oncology receptors such as CTLA-4 or LAG-3. In contrast to those bispecific efforts described by others that have focused on a single pair of antigen-binding domains at a time, we have applied our StitchMabsTM technology to broadly screen for pairs of bispecific antigen-binding domains with the highest potential to generate antitumor activity. Our efforts were enabled not only by the StitchMabsTM technology, but also by our investment in generating a broad portfolio of selective antibodies to 40 potential immune targets across the innate and adaptive immune system.
 
We designed our combinatorial screen such that one antigen-binding domain was directed against PD-1, and the other selected from our library of candidate antibodies. We screened these StitchMabsTM bispecific constructs in T-cell activation assays in the presence of PD-L1 expressing cells. Our unbiased screening led us to an antibody that pairs a PD-1 binding domain and a PD-L1 binding domain. This novel bispecific antibody contributed to T-cell activation that outperformed the activation observed in response to treatment with PD-1-only antibodies. We designated CTX-8371 as the bispecific antibody we constructed using our common light chain antibodies having a PD-1 and PD-L1 antigen binding domains.
 


A PD-1 x PD-L1 bispecific antibody outperformed single PD-1 antibodies in a T-cell activation assay 
 
The observation that the combination of a PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody into a bispecific antibody would be hundreds to thousands fold more potent in a T-cell activation assay than a PD-1 antibody alone was unexpected. A simple model would suggest that inhibiting either PD-1 or PD-L1 should have approximately equal effects in this assay and there would be no advantage to inhibiting both. Further investigation into the mechanism of CTX-8371 found that it led to T-cell activation through four mechanisms:
 

● | Dual checkpoint blocker: preventing PD-L1 to PD-1 binding, thus relieving the immunosuppressive PD-1 signal;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cell engager: bridging the connection between the PD-L1 expressing tumor cell and the PD-1 expressing T-cell, potentially facilitating T-cell engagement and enhancement of effector function;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Downregulation of PD-1: triggering the shedding of the extracellular domain of PD-1 receptors from the surface of T-cells resulting in a reduction in the levels of PD-1 on T-cells; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    24 

  


● | Indirect CD28 agonist: increasing the pool of free CD80 on tumor cells making it available to bind and activate the CD28 T-cell co-stimulatory receptor, thereby, sending a positive signal to the T-cell, which enhances its activation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
Differentiated mechanism of action of CTX-8371 drives enhanced T-cell activation 
 
We also found that the greater activity of CTX-8371 in our T-cell activation assay compared to PD-1 inhibition also extended to PD-L1 inhibition. Furthermore, CTX-8371 was associated with significantly more antitumor activity in a murine B16F10 melanoma model than was monotherapy with either a PD-1 inhibitor or a PD-L1 inhibitor or combination of both. Tumor growth in monotherapy-treated mice and in the combination PD-1 and PD-L1-treated mice was slowed to approximately half that observed with tumors in untreated mice. In contrast, tumor growth was essentially stopped by the CTX-8371 bispecific antibody. Treatment with CTX-8371 resulted in improved overall survival in this model and cured three of eight mice, such that their tumors were completely eradicated.
 


Tumor growth inhibition was improved when treating mice with CTX-8371 compared to treating them with monoclonal antibodies that inhibited either PD-1, PD-L1, or the combination of PD-1 and PD-L1 
 
    25 

  



Dosing with CTX-8371 led to improved overall survival in a B16F10 melanoma model compared to either PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors or to the combination of both 
 
CTX-8371 also reduced tumor growth in the syngeneic MB49 bladder cancer model and in the syngeneic EMT-6 breast cancer models which are known to be non-responsive to checkpoint blocker treatments.
 


Dosing with CTX-8371 led to tumor growth inhibition in the syngeneic EMT-6 breast cancer model and in the syngeneic MB49 bladder cancer model 
 
In April 2022, we presented preclinical data on CTX-8371’s potential unique mechanism of action ("MOA") that involves cleavage of cell surface PD-1, at the 2022 American Association for Cancer Research ("AACR") annual meeting. A summary of the results are as follows:
 

● | Treatment with CTX-8371 led to PD-1 loss from the surface of intra-tumoral T cells in tumor-bearing transgenic hPD-1/h-PD-L1 mice, and on peripheral blood T cells in cynomolgus monkeys; this unique MOA differentiates CTX-8371 from marketed inhibitors targeting either PD-1 or PD-L1
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clearance and half-life of CTX-8371 were within the expected ranges for a human IgG1 antibody in NHPs with a linear PK
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment with CTX-8371 in the aggressive MC38-hPD-L1 colorectal mouse model led to a dose-proportional reduction in tumor volume and a complete eradication of tumors at the highest dose
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Taken together, the murine and cynomolgus monkey PK data, receptor occupancy data, and in vivo efficacy data in murine models will be used to calculate the predicted human efficacious dose range for CTX-8371

Development Plans for CTX-8371
 
We completed our first GMP manufacturing campaign for CTX-8371 in the second quarter of 2022. IND-enabling studies, including GLP toxicology studies in NHPs, were completed in the first quarter of 2023. We are currently targeting an IND submission to the FDA for CTX-8371 in the first half of 2023.
 
Early-Stage Discovery
 
Our approach has been based on the observation that traditional methods of antibody discovery are slow, inefficient, and are limited by lack of diversity of antigenic sites, or epitopes, that are recognized using these methods. We believe these limitations impair drug developers’ ability to identify the best product candidates. We have created several technological solutions that are designed to address the key challenges in antibody development with the goal of incorporating our solutions into bispecific product candidates. First, we developed and acquired several complementary platforms that enable us to generate antibodies with a high level of epitope diversity and excellent physical and biochemical properties. Second, we have developed sophisticated technologies to screen our antibody sets in functional biological assays designed to prioritize antibodies with desirable biological activities. Third, we have developed our proprietary StitchMabsTM technology that allows us to rapidly evaluate the potential of the antibodies we discover in a bispecific antibody format.
 
We have also developed a proprietary transgenic mouse line that produces antibodies with the differentiated property that they all share a human common light chain. We imposed this restriction at the earliest stage of our bispecific antibody discovery process in anticipation of the need to simplify the manufacturing of our bispecific product candidates. Sharing a common light chain enables our bispecific antibodies to be manufactured using a well-established process that has been successfully used by the biopharmaceutical industry to produce monoclonal antibodies at commercial scale, thereby avoiding the complexities associated with the manufacture of bispecific products that lack this property. We found that imposing this restriction on the construction of the antibody pool did not hinder our ability to obtain highly potent and selective antibodies.
 
We have focused exclusively on modulation of the immune system through the development of novel antibody therapeutics. Antibodies are structurally distinct Y-shaped proteins formed through the pairing of two long proteins, called heavy chains, and two short proteins, called light chains. Each heavy and light chain pair forms a binding site where the antibody specifically binds its target, which is also known as an antigen.
 
The immune system is capable of not only fighting foreign invaders, but also of recognizing and eliminating a human body’s own cells that have become pathogenic after transformation, such as in cancer. There are two broad classes of antibodies used in cancer therapy. The majority of antibodies directly target the tumor or its surroundings. The more recent class consists of antibodies that modulate the immune system leading to immune- mediated killing of tumors. These antibody drugs mainly exert this effect via a single modulation of the immune system. We believe that modulation of more than one function of the immune system simultaneously has the potential to improve the therapeutic benefit and utility of immuno-oncology therapies.
 
Antibodies can be generated in many ways, and multiple companies claim to possess proprietary antibody discovery platforms, each with specific advantages. Our antibody platform was designed with a broad set of capabilities and resources that we can leverage with the goal of generating a portfolio of highly distinct bispecific products.
 
Our approach to bispecific antibody discovery encompasses four principles:
 

● | antibody diversity is required to generate a representative sample of possible therapies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | functional screening is critical to identifying optimal solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    27 

  


● | a combinatorial approach enables parallel assessment of many potential bispecific antibodies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | decisions made at the start of the discovery process have a major impact on successful clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Antibody diversity 
 
We obtained our initial pools of antibodies from multiple internally-developed platforms, including our custom phage display library and our transgenic mouse line. We constructed our phage display library based on the peripheral B cell diversity of 70 healthy human donors. This system allows us to generate large and highly diverse sets of antibodies that are fully human; target multiple epitopes on a target of interest; and possess excellent physical and biochemical properties. We describe these antibodies as having good ‘drug-like’ properties. To generate additional antibody candidates, we can also immunize a proprietary line of humanized transgenic mice with antigens of interest to isolate a diverse set of fully human antibodies that share a common human light chain, but distinct native mouse heavy chains. We estimate that the pool of antibodies from these two platforms represents over 1010 unique sequences.
 
We have expressed libraries of antibodies against any particular target using our Human Display technology which streamlines the expression of functional antibodies such that each cell expresses only one antibody clone. We then further screen our diverse sets of antibodies expressed with our Human Display technology to fine-tune for specificity. Sequence changes can be readily introduced to further optimize leads from our screens.
 
Our ability to generate viable antibody candidates, with good drug-like properties and high manufacturability potential in a high-throughput manner has enabled us to rapidly assemble a portfolio of proprietary antibodies to over 40 key innate and adaptive immune targets and tumor antigens. This portfolio of antibodies is designed to provide us with a set of well-characterized antibodies that can be incorporated into our combinatorial bispecific antibody screening platform.
 


We have discovered proprietary antibodies that modulate two key components of the immune system: innate immunity and adaptive immunity as well as antibodies to selected antigens on tumor cells. This expansive collection of antibodies allows us to use our proprietary technologies to uncover unexpected synergies.

Functional Screening 
 
A critical part of our antibody discovery process is our ability to produce sufficient quantities of purified antibodies to assess their biological activities both in cells and, in some cases, animal models. Our human display technology allows us to efficiently express full-length antibodies on cell surface, thereby facilitating the high throughput screening of our antibodies across multiple functional screens. While we do assess standard biochemical parameters such as binding affinity and specificity as part of the initial screening of our candidate sets, we note that activity in a complex biological system cannot be predicted based on physical and biochemical parameters alone. We have shown with CTX-471, for example, that activity in a complex biological system cannot necessarily be predicted on strictly biochemical parameters.
 
StitchMabsTM Technology
 
A natural antibody recognizes a single target antigen and is therefore monospecific. Because a natural antibody features two identical binding sites, it is considered bivalent for that target. Although natural antibodies recognize a single target antigen, it is possible to engineer antibodies so that their two binding sites bind two different targets. The construction of a bispecific antibody typically requires a significant investment in cloning, construct optimization, protein expression, and protein purification before the therapeutic potential of any particular bispecific antibody can be assessed. In practice, these requirements mean that the diversity of antigen pairs targeted by bispecific antibodies is limited, and development is oftentimes prioritized for antigen pairs suggested by existing scientific literature.
 
Our proprietary StitchMabsTM technology is a novel screening approach which we developed to assess the potential of any pair of antigen-binding sites in a bispecific antibody format. This combinatorial antibody-linking technology stably and irreversibly attaches a second pair of antigen-binding domains to a standard antibody during a 15-minute incubation at room temperature. The resulting stitched antibody acts structurally and functionally like a bispecific antibody.
 
StitchMabsTM allows us to assess our large library of antigen-binding domains in combinatorial fashion. Once we have generated and purified large numbers of bispecific candidates, we then assess the potential of these candidates in functional assays and determine whether these bispecifics have additive, reductive or synergistic activity. Screening of these bispecific molecules in functional assays has led us to discover novel product candidates with unexpected synergistic activity in cellular and animal models.
 
Common Light Chain Platform 
 
The embedded common light chain feature in our antibodies greatly simplifies the manufacture of our bispecific product candidates. Most antigen-binding domains of antibodies are composed of a heavy chain and a light chain that have been optimized together to recognize a specific antigen. If these two chains are expressed independently, as is the case with most antibody manufacturing processes, they are often reassembled in various ways, leading to heterogenous mixture of the desired product along with peptide segments corresponding to two heavy chains and two light chains. Separation of the desired product from the mixture is a technically challenging and expensive process. We address this challenge by including only common light chain compatible antibodies as part of our antibody discovery process for potential incorporation into bispecifics. The variability in the antigen-binding domain of our antibodies in the heavy chain is sufficient to generate a diverse, potent, selective, and functionally active set of antibodies. We further simplified the manufacturing of our bispecific antibodies by assembling a single heavy chain construct that encodes both antigen-binding domains. As a result, the manufacturing of our bispecifics closely resembles that of standard monoclonal antibodies, which include—one heavy chain and one light chain. Our focus on common light chain antibodies simplifies the process of converting our StitchMabsTM screening candidates into bispecific antibody product candidates.

Intellectual Property 
 
Overview 
 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions, and know-how to enhance improvements that are important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the strength of our position in the field of antibody therapeutics that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties.
 
Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products depends in large part on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third-party licensors. With respect to company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and internationally in certain jurisdictions where it is available. For example, we file U.S. and selected foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also intend to seek patent protection, or rely upon trade secret rights, to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel products or improvements thereof. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional application which matures into a granted patent. A U.S. patent also may be accorded a patent term adjustment ("PTA"), under certain circumstances to compensate for delays in obtaining the patent caused by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in the U.S., the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the U.S., will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
 
    31 

  

Patent Protection 
 
For all patent applications, we determine strategy for claim scope on a case-by-case basis, taking into account advice of counsel and our business model and needs. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, based on our assessment of their strategic value. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as pending and issued patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
 
Our patent estate includes patent applications with claims relating to our product candidates, methods of use and manufacturing processes, and claims for potential future products and developments. As of January 31, 2023, we have greater than 80 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions relating to CTX-009, CTX-471, CTX-8371 and other discovery and research programs. We have 6 patents issued in the United States related to our CTX-471 program, and 1 patent issued in the United States related to our CTX-8371 program. We also have access to patents issued in Australia, Europe and the United States related to our antibody and display programs as well as patents issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Russia and United States related to our CTX-009 program.
 
More specifically, we have licensed 2 pending patent families with approximately 29 issued patents in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions related to our DLL4/VEGF antibody program including, but not limited to, our CTX-009 therapeutic candidate. Patents in these patent families are generally expected to start to expire in 2033, subject to possible extension.
 
We own 4 pending patent families with 6 issued U.S. patents, 4 U.S. Utility or provisional patent applications, and 40 patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, related to our CD137 agonist antibody therapeutic platform including, but not limited to, our CTX-471 therapeutic candidate. Patents that grant from these patent families are generally expected to start to expire in 2038, subject to possible patent term extension.
 
We own 2 pending patent families with 1 issued U.S. patent, 2 U.S. Utility or provisional patent applications, and 18 patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, related to our PD-1/PD-L1 bispecific antibody therapeutic platform including, but not limited to, our CTX-8371 therapeutic candidate. Patents that grant from these patent families are generally expected to start to expire in 2039, subject to possible patent term extension.
 
We own, or have an ownership interest in, 2 pending patent families with 2 U.S. Utility or provisional patent applications and 3 patent applications in foreign jurisdictions related to our discovery and research programs. Patents that grant from these patent families are generally expected to start to expire in 2039, subject to possible patent term extension.
 
We own 3 pending patent families with 3 U.S. Utility or provisional patent applications and 1 patent application in foreign jurisdictions related to our antibody and display programs including, but not limited to, common light chains and mammalian display platforms. Patents that grant from these patent families are generally expected to start to expire in 2039, subject to possible patent term extension.
 
Trademark Protection 
 
We have filed for and obtained trademark protection in multiple jurisdictions for the COMPASS THERAPEUTICS word mark and logo for goods and services. We have filed for and obtained trademark protection on the StitchMabsTM word mark in the United States for services.
 
    32 

  

Trade Secret Protection 
 
Finally, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For further information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Competition 
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immuno-oncology subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. We believe that our programs, including CTX-009, CTX-471, CTX-8371 and our platform technologies, including our StitchMabsTM platform and our programs, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, but we also face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Our competitors include larger and better funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and therapeutics companies, including companies focused on cancer immunotherapies, such as AbbVie, Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Merck KGaA, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi S.A. Moreover, we may also compete with smaller or earlier-stage companies, universities and other research institutions that have developed, are developing or may be developing current and future cancer therapeutics.
 
Product candidates that we successfully develop will compete with a range of therapies that are currently approved and any new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products. Currently marketed oncology drugs and therapeutics range from traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, to antibody-drug conjugates, such as Genentech Inc.’s Kadcyla, to immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4, such as BMS’s Yervoy, to PD-1/PD-L1, such as BMS’s Opdivo, Merck & Co.’s Keytruda and Genentech’s Tecentriq, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, such as Amgen’s Blincyto and VEGF targets, such as Genentech Inc.’s Avastin. In addition to these marketed therapies, numerous compounds are in clinical development for the potential treatment of cancer.
 
Biliary tract cancers are aggressive and rare gastrointestinal cancers that have a very poor prognosis.  First line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BTC includes the chemotherapy combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, often with the addition of the PD-1 inhibitor Imfinzi® (durvalumab). In September of 2022, AstraZeneca received FDA approval of durvalumab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin for the first line treatment of BTC.  The only FDA approved therapies for second line treatment of BTC are targeted therapies that address specific tumor mutations or solid tumors that are microsatellite instability high. There is also recently emerging clinical data that blockade of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“Her-2”) may be beneficial to the small subset of patients in whom HER-2 is amplified. We believe that these targeted therapies are appropriate for 10-15% of BTC patients.
 
Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States and constitutes approximately 10% of all annually diagnosed cancer and cancer related deaths globally. Treatment of metastatic disease in the first line typically includes either the VEGF inhibitor Avastin® (bevacizumab) or an EGFR inhibitor such as Erbitux® (cetuximab), combined with chemotherapy. Treatment in the second line includes re-treatment with either a VEGR or EGFR inhibitor and a different chemotherapy regimen that is either oxaliplatin or irinotecan based. Approved therapies for advanced patients with metastatic disease are limited, with approved agents such as Lonsurf® (trifluridine and tipiracil) and Stivarga® (regorafenib) offering only 1-2% response rates and improvement in survival of 1-2 months.  
 
    33 

  

If we are successful in advancing one or more of our product candidates toward registrational trials and filing a BLA or BLAs, and if we are successful at obtaining approvals from the FDA or any other regulatory agency to market one or more of our product candidates, then the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors, who may be successful at obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory approval for their products prior to us obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, could result in our competitors launching their products sooner and establishing a strong market position before we are even able to enter the market.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We hold worldwide rights to all of our product candidates (with the exception of limited countries for CTX-009), which provide us the optionality to grow our internal pipeline independently or partner selected rights to our product candidates in different geographies throughout the world. Subject to receiving marketing approval, we intend to maximize the value of our product candidates by either independently planning to pursue the commercialization of our products in one or more major geographies by building an internal sales and marketing organization, or by seeking collaborations with third parties with commercialization infrastructure.
 
At the appropriate time in the future, and if one or more of our product candidates continues to advance successfully in development and enter registrational trials, we also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any product candidates that we would potentially market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of such marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. We have relied on, and intend to continue to rely on, qualified third-party contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates, including clinical supplies to support our clinical trials. At the appropriate time in the product development process, we will determine whether to establish manufacturing facilities or continue to rely on third parties to manufacture clinical quantities of any products that we may successfully develop. We expect that commercial quantities of any compound and materials for our product candidates, if approved, will be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with FDA and other regulations, which may differ from our current clinical supply manufacturers.
Government Regulation 
 
Government authorities in the United States, including federal, state, and local authorities, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of biological products, such as those we are developing. In addition, some government authorities regulate the pricing of such products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
    34 

  

Review and Approval for Licensing Biologics in the United States 
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA"), and their implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any biological product can be marketed in the United States. Biological products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests and nonclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP"), regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCPs"), to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP");
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a biological product candidate that is safe, pure, and potent prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, a product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
 
    35 

  

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational biological product to humans in clinical trials. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan, the protocol(s) for human trials and the safety of trial participants. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time during clinical trials and may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit trials, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time.
 
Clinical Trials 
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB, before the trials may be initiated and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 
The clinical investigation of a biological product is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
 
Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate safety, purity and potency, to evaluate the overall benefit-risk profile of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the biological product. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 
In March 2022, the FDA released a final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts is included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce development costs and time.
 
    36 

  

Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data and safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 
A sponsor of an investigational biological product for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational biological product. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational biological product or, as applicable, 15 days after the biological product receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy or fast track product.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Submission of a BLA to the FDA 
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee. For fiscal year 2023, the application user fee is $3,242,026, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee of $393,933 for each approved biological product on the market. These fees are typically increased annually. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the BLA application fee and may be exempted from program fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.
 
A BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including trials initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all BLAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal for novel biological products generally is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification.
 
    37 

  

Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel biological product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
The FDA’s Decision on a BLA 
 
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts relevant inspections, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biological product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will identify the deficiencies that prevent the FDA from approving the application and may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial.
 
The FDA could also approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), program to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs 
 
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of BLAs. For example, fast track designation may be granted to a biological product intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs. The key benefits of fast track designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA during development and testing, the eligibility for priority review, and rolling review, which is submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted.
 
Additionally, the FDA may grant a product candidate priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the marketing application for a novel product at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where the proposed product is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
    38 

  

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition upon the determination that the product generally provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over available treatments and demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct post-approval confirmatory trials or complete ongoing trials in a diligent manner to verify the product’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that post-approval confirmatory trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after accelerated approval is granted and the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a product or an indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial is not conducted with due diligence or fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. Additionally, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for preapproval and pre-use review.
 
In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the biological product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biological products, to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as a fast track designation, in addition to intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient development program.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Biological products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. Biological product manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are also required to comply with applicable product tracking and tracing requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production, or distribution, or may require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
 
    39 

  

The FDA may suspend or revoke product license approvals if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. FDA has authority to require post-market studies, in certain circumstances, on reduced effectiveness of a biological product and FDA may require labeling changes related to new reduced effectiveness information. Other potential consequences of a failure to maintain regulatory compliance include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Biological products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity 
 
A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ("PSP"), within sixty days of an end of Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. Generally, development program candidates designated as orphan drugs are exempt from the above requirements. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric trials are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the BLA sponsor’s data.
 
    40 

  

Patent Term Restoration 
 
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch- Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of the product’s approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("Affordable Care Act"), signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCI"), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of its product. In addition, The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. The first biologic submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product is eligible for a period of exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the same reference product for any condition of use. The FDA may approve multiple “first” interchangeable products so long as they are all approved on the same first day of marketing. This exclusivity period, which may be shared amongst multiple first interchangeable products, lasts for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. Products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA may be readily substituted by pharmacies and such substitution is which are governed by state pharmacy law.

European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation 
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and in other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization application ("CTA"), must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP, the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The content of the BLA filed in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.
 
Countries that are part of the European Union, as well as countries outside of the European Union, have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of biological products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Authorization Procedures in the European Union 
 
Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 
Centralized procedure. The European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area ("EEA"), which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
 
    42 

  

For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
 
National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 
Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 
Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 
In some cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan ("PIP"), or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric trials and their timing relative to clinical trials in adults.
 
New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 
 
In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Accelerated Review 
 
Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP")). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), managed care providers, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and other organizations. These third-party payors decide which medications they will pay for and will establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments such as antibody-based therapies.
 
    43 

  

In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"). CMS decides whether and to what extent our products will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
 

● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

 
Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), managed care providers, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and other organizations. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
 
No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.
 
Further, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, we may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Our product candidates may nonetheless not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition.
 
In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union Member States can restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and they can control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Approaches between Member States are diverging. For example, in France, effective market access will be supported by agreements with hospitals and products may be reimbursed by the Social Security Fund. The price of medicines is negotiated with the Economic Committee for Health Products ("CEPS"). There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

Current and future healthcare reform legislation 
 
In the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, expands the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a mandatory discount program for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ("BBA"), effective as of January 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
 
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative efforts to expand, repeal, replace or modify the ACA, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the law, as well as court challenges to the constitutionality of the law. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
 
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
 

● | On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension that lasted from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the suspension, a 1% payment reduction began April 1, 2022, and remained through June 30, 2022. The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    45 

  


● | On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
 
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation ("MFN"), Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) further delayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 
    46 

  

In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that create a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. The effect of IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, among others:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebates), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or for the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, or arranging for, an item, good, facility or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act ("FCA");

● | federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors, that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring qui tam actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;

● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), which created additional criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;

● | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the ACA and its implementing regulations, which requires drug, device, medical supply, and biologics manufacturers to disclose payments under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to HHS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;

● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH"), and its implementing regulations, which imposes, among other things, certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, transmit or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;

● | federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and

● | analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above U.S. federal laws, such as anti- kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or patients; state and local marketing and/or transparency laws applicable to manufacturers that may be broader in scope than the federal requirements; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws that require the licensure of sales representatives; state laws that require biopharmaceutical companies to comply with the biopharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018); and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, reputational harm, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
 
We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.
 
Employees and Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 26 employees,13 of which were primarily engaged in research and development and clinical activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
