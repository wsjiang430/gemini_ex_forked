Item 1. BUSINESS
United States Steel Corporation (U. S. Steel) is an integrated steel producer of flat-rolled and tubular products with major production operations in the United States and Europe. An integrated steel producer uses iron ore and coke as primary raw materials for steel production. U. S. Steel has annual raw steel production capability of 22.0 million net tons (17.0 million tons in the United States and 5.0 million tons in Europe). U. S. Steel supplies customers throughout the world primarily in the automotive, consumer, industrial and oil country tubular goods (OCTG) markets. According to World Steel Association’s latest published statistics, in 2017 U. S. Steel was the third largest steel producer in the United States and the twenty-sixth largest steel producer in the world. U. S. Steel is also engaged in other business activities consisting primarily of railroad services and real estate operations. U. S. Steel is a Delaware corporation established in 1901.
Segments
U. S. Steel has three reportable operating segments: North American Flat-Rolled (Flat-Rolled), U. S. Steel Europe (USSE) and Tubular Products (Tubular). The results of our railroad and real estate businesses that do not constitute reportable segments are combined and disclosed in the Other Businesses category.
Flat-Rolled
The Flat-Rolled segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plants and equity investees in North America involved in the production of slabs, strip mill plates, sheets and tin mill products, as well as all iron ore and coke production facilities in the United States. These operations primarily serve North American customers in the service center, conversion, transportation (including automotive), construction, container, and appliance and electrical markets. 
The Flat-Rolled segment is structured to specifically address customer needs through three "commercial entities." Our Flat-Rolled segment commercial entities are focused on customers in the: (1) automotive, (2) consumer and (3) industrial, service center and mining industries. 
Automotive Solutions collaborates with customers to develop solutions such as the next generation of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) to address challenges facing the automotive industry, including increased fuel economy standards and enhanced safety requirements.
Consumer Solutions partners with customers in the appliance, packaging, container and construction markets. Consumer Solutions has a robust presence with our tin customers, who represent roughly one quarter of this market category. Additional product lines within the market category include the Company's COR-TEN AZP®, ACRYLUME®, GALVALUME® and Weathered Metals Series®.
Industrial, Service Center and Mining Solutions focuses on the Company's customers in the service center business, pipe and tube manufacturing markets, and agricultural and industrial equipment markets.
Flat-Rolled has aggregate annual raw steel production capability of 17.0 million tons produced at our Gary Works, Mon Valley Works, Great Lakes Works and Granite City Works facilities. Raw steel production was 11.9 million tons in 2018, 10.8 million tons in 2017 and 10.7 million tons in 2016. Raw steel production averaged 70 percent of capability in 2018, 64 percent of capability in 2017 and 63 percent of capability in 2016. During December 2015 the Granite City Works steelmaking operations were temporarily idled. The steelmaking operations and hot strip mill were restarted during 2018 and 2017, respectively. If its production capability is excluded during the temporary idle period, Flat-Rolled production would have been 76 percent and 75 percent of capability in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
European Operations
The USSE segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel Košice (USSK), U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plant and coke production facilities in Slovakia, and its subsidiaries. USSE primarily serves customers in the Eastern European service center, conversion, transportation (including automotive), construction, container, appliance and electrical, and oil, gas and petrochemical markets. USSE produces and sells slabs, strip mill plate, sheet, tin mill products and spiral welded pipe, as well as heating radiators and refractory ceramic materials.

USSE has annual raw steel production capability of 5.0 million tons. USSE’s raw steel production was 5.0 million tons in 2018, 5.1 million tons in 2017, and 5.0 million tons in 2016. USSE’s raw steel production averaged 100 percent of capability in 2018, 102 percent of capability in 2017 and 99 percent of capability in 2016.
Tubular
The Tubular segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel’s tubular production facilities and an equity investee in the United States. These operations produce and sell seamless and electric resistance welded (ERW) steel casing and tubing (commonly known as OCTG), and standard and line pipe and mechanical tubing and primarily serve customers in the oil, gas and petrochemical markets. Tubular's annual production capability is 1.9 million tons, which includes the annual production capability of the No. 1 Electric-Weld Pipe mill at Lone Star Tubular Operations that U. S. Steel plans to restart (see "Item 1. Business - Facilities and Locations - Tubular" for further information). 
U. S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc. (USSTP), a wholly owned subsidiary of U. S. Steel, is continuing to design and develop a range of premium and semi-premium connections to address the growing needs for technical solutions for our end users' well site production challenges. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, U. S. Steel Oilwell Services, LLC, USSTP also offers rig site services, which provides the technical expertise for proper installation of our tubular products and proprietary connections at the well site.

Business Strategy
Our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value by remaining profitable through business cycles by focusing on three critical success factors: winning in attractive markets, moving down the cost curve and moving up the talent curve. Foundational to our efforts is our belief that we must operate as a principled company committed to our S.T.E.E.L. principles, outlined in our Code of Ethical Business Conduct. Our core value of safety - the safety of our employees, our environment, our communities and our facilities and equipment - has served us well for much of our history and our commitment to it remains as strong as the products we make every day. 
We are focused on winning in attractive markets through a customer-focused business model. We have made significant progress and our goal remains to deliver high-quality, value-added products on time every time and to collaborate with customers to develop innovative solutions that address their most challenging needs. The strategic positioning of operations within the commercial entities enhances our ability to better hear the voice of the customer, ensuring that we deliver superior value and drive results in the markets we choose to serve.
To position the Company to increase profitability and win in attractive markets, we continue to enhance our cost structure and move down the cost curve. The next phase of our operations transformation will be defined by our continued implementation of disciplined and standardized business and operations practices, continued investments in asset revitalization and reliability-centered maintenance and a renewed focus on innovation and technology. 
Core to our strategy is moving up the talent curve. The success of our business is driven by the efforts of our hard-working employees. We know that we must work to identify, attract and retain best-in-class diverse talent. Our goal is to build a pipeline mapping the right people to the right value-driving roles. Fostering a culture that incentivizes the right behavior and allows for a best talent wins environment will help achieve our operational and financial objectives.
Our performance has strengthened our earnings profile and balance sheet and positions us well to continue the execution of our strategy throughout the business cycle. To accomplish our strategy, U. S. Steel will continue to evaluate potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include the acquisition, divestiture or consolidation of assets. Given the cyclicality of our industry, we are focused on strategically maintaining and spending cash (including capital investments under our asset revitalization program), in order to invest in areas consistent with our long-term strategy, such as sustainable steel technologies, and are considering various possibilities, including exiting lines of business and the sale of certain assets, that we believe would ultimately result in a stronger balance sheet and greater stockholder value. The Company will pursue opportunities based on its long-term strategy, and what the Board of Directors determines to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders at the time.
Steel Innovation
We are continuing to develop the next generation of steel products for our customers. Our Generation 3 (GEN3) steel, the XG3TM steel, will provide superior formability and high-strength properties while using a low-alloyed approach for robust weldability. To expand our capabilities in GEN3 steels, a new continuous galvanizing line is currently under construction at our PRO-TEC Coating Company joint venture (PRO-TEC), which will allow PRO-TEC to produce these GEN3 steels with a hot-dipped zinc coating. This line will be the first of its kind and will utilize proprietary technology capable of producing the high-quality, cutting-edge advanced high-strength steels that will meet our automotive customers’ needs and solve some of their most pressing challenges.
Asset Revitalization 
In 2017, we launched our asset revitalization program, a multi-year, comprehensive $2 billion investment in our most critical assets within our Flat-rolled segment. The program is composed of many projects designed to continuously improve safety, quality, delivery and cost performance. We expect capital spending for the entire program to be approximately $1.5 billion. As we revitalize our assets, we are increasing profitability, productivity and operational stability, and reducing volatility. This program is designed to prioritize investment in the areas with the highest returns.
Importantly, while this is a large program, most projects are not complex, making projects easier to execute. Due to the smaller nature of many of the projects, we do not have to complete the entire program in order to start seeing benefits, as evident in our 2018 performance. Also, by breaking the program down into a series of smaller projects, we have greater flexibility to adjust the scope and pace of project implementation based on changes in business conditions. Our asset revitalization program covers investments in our existing assets and involves investments beyond routine capital and maintenance spending. These projects are expected to deliver both operational and 
22

commercial benefits, with most of the benefits coming from operational improvements. The commercial benefits we expect to realize will be driven primarily by things we can control, such as better product quality, improved delivery performance, and increased throughput on constrained assets. Being regarded as a top quartile performer in the eyes of our customers will support sustainable commercial benefits from these investments. We will deliver products to our customers with improved reliability and quality. While this program only covers our existing assets, it will create a stable foundation for our future as we continue to evaluate strategic growth projects to strengthen our position as the markets we serve continue to grow and evolve. 
We designed a performance scorecard to measure our success in implementing the asset revitalization program, focusing on two financial metrics (EBITDA and capital expenditures) and two non-financial metrics (quality and reliability). We set a goal for each metric that we plan to achieve as we exit 2020, as compared to our 2016 performance for each metric. To monitor our progress, we also set interim annual goals within each metric, and report progress against those metrics annually. We continued to make good progress in 2018 on our asset revitalization program and exceeded the scorecard targets we had committed to for 2018. We disclosed our 2019 targets for each of these metrics in January 2019 and are focused on achieving our goals.
Benefits from the program are noticeable and include operational impacts achieved through asset key performance indicator improvement and the commercial impact of additional throughput as a result of our investments. 
Our quality metric, which is based on internal diversion and retreat volumes only, improved 19% in 2018 versus the base period. We are seeing substantial improvements in addition to internal diversion and retreat volumes, particularly in customer claims and the cost of poor quality as a result of our asset revitalization efforts. Going forward, we are considering expanding the scope of the quality metric to also include these types of important quality measures. We believe an expanded metric could provide a more comprehensive quality measurement. No decision regarding a change in the quality metric has been made. We are implementing reliability-centered maintenance focusing on thirteen priority assets and a few others within our Flat-Rolled segment. Our reliability metric improved 16% versus the 2016 base period. We are running our assets more reliably resulting in improved operating equipment effectiveness. As a result of these improvements, we have increased throughput versus 2016 despite additional planned outages. Exiting 2020, we expect to be capable of producing approximately one million more tons of slabs on existing assets at Gary Works, Great Lakes Works, and Mon Valley Works as compared with actual production in 2016.
Safety 
U. S. Steel has a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of the men and women who work in our facilities. Safety is our primary core value. Every employee deserves to return home safely at the end of every day, and we are working to eliminate all injuries and incidents at all of our facilities. Ensuring a safe workplace also improves productivity, quality, reliability and financial performance. By making safety and health a personal responsibility, our employees are making a daily commitment to follow safe work practices, look out for the safety of co-workers and ensure safe working conditions for everyone. A “Safety First” mindset is as essential to our success as the tools and technologies we rely on to do business.
Our objective is to attain a sustainable zero harm culture supported by leadership and owned by an engaged and highly skilled workforce, empowered with the capabilities and resources needed to assess, reduce, and eliminate workplace risks and hazards. In support of these objectives, we have developed an enhanced Safety Management System, initiated new safety communication methods and enhanced contractor safety processes. We experienced zero work-related fatalities among our employees and contractors in 2018.
U. S. Steel finished 2018 with a Global Total OSHA Recordable Rate of 0.95, which is 63% better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron & Steel rate of 2.60 and 30% better than American Iron and Steel Institute rate of 1.36. U. S. Steel finished 2018 with a Days Away From Work Rate of 0.14, which is 80% better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron & Steel rate of 0.70 and 46% better than American Iron and Steel Institute rate of 0.26. Additionally, when comparing our most severe injuries - cases involving 31 or more days away from work - U. S. Steel performs at a level almost 13 times better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron and Steel. 
The 10 year performance for our key safety measures: Total Recordable Incidence and Days Away From Work rates are shown in the following graphs.

Environmental Stewardship
U. S. Steel is committed to effective environmental stewardship. We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are environmentally effective. We believe part of being a good corporate citizen requires a dedicated focus on how our industry affects the environment. U. S. Steel's environmental expenditures totaled $350 million in 2018, $255 million in 2017 and $232 million in 2016. Overall, environmental compliance expenditures represent approximately 2% of U. S. Steel’s total costs and expenses. For further information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Environmental Matters.” We have taken the actions described below in furtherance of that goal. 
U. S. Steel, largely through the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), World Steel Association and the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer), is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air, water, waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels.
We are committed to reducing emissions as well as our carbon footprint. We have investigated, created and implemented innovative, best practice solutions throughout U. S. Steel to manage and reduce energy consumption. We are also committed to investing in technologies to further improve the environmental performance of our steelmaking process. In addition, we continue to focus on implementing energy reduction strategies, use of efficient energy sources, waste reduction management and the utilization of by-product fuels.
According to the AISI, relative to competing materials, steel has approximately one-fifth the carbon footprint of aluminum, one-twelfth the footprint of magnesium, and one-ninth the footprint of carbon fiber composites. Our advanced high strength steel (AHSS) used in today’s vehicles afford significant light-weighting opportunities that assist the automobile industry in meeting ever-increasing fuel economy standards while enhancing a vehicle's safety and engine performance. When comparing steel to aluminum, in terms of sustainability, steel has a smaller carbon footprint and costs less.
In 2018 alone, U. S. Steel recycled 3.2 million tons of purchased and produced steel scrap. Because of steel’s physical properties, our products can be recycled at the end of their useful life without loss of quality, contributing to steel’s high recycling rate and affordability. Comparatively, due to limitations in aluminum processing, very little recycled aluminum is included in aluminum sheet goods used for automotive or aircraft applications. This means that any increased use of aluminum sheet for high-end applications must come from Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensive primary aluminum, which generates significantly more GHG emissions than steel.
Many of our major production facilities have Environmental Management Systems that are certified to the ISO 14001 Standard. This standard, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), provides the framework for the measurement and improvement of environmental impacts of the certified facility.
In April of 2018, we released our 2017 Sustainability Report in which we have committed to establishing a GHG emission reduction goal by the end of 2019. We are gathering data to establish our GHG emissions baseline to help us prioritize reduction strategies and allocate the necessary capital. We are committed to reducing energy usage and have implemented projects, including replacing incandescent lights with LED lighting, to reduce electricity consumption and are utilizing monitoring and predictive modeling to increase energy efficiencies and reduce natural gas and electricity consumption. By using the blast furnace and coke oven gas generated in our cokemaking and steelmaking activities to power our facilities, we avoided consuming natural gas and other fuels from 2015 to 2018 to heat more than 3.8 million households each year. In 2018, we recycled approximately 3 million tons of blast furnace slag and 0.4 million tons of steel slag by selling it for use as aggregate and in highway construction.
Commercial Strategy
Our commercial strategy is focused on providing customer focused solutions with value-added steel products, including AHSS leadership with GEN3 steels, coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries, electrical steel sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment, both bare and prepainted galvanized and Galvalume® sheets for construction, hot rolled skelp used in the production of energy transmitting line pipe, tin mill products for the packaging industry and pipe, connections, accessories and rig site services for use in drilling for oil and gas. 
We are responsive to our customers' changing needs by developing new steel products and uses for steel that meet the evolving market and regulatory demands imposed on them. In connection with this commitment, we have research centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Košice, Slovakia, an automotive center in Troy, Michigan and a Research 
26

and Development Laboratory and Test Facility for Tubular products in Houston, Texas. The focus of these centers is to develop new products and to collaborate with our customers to better provide innovative solutions to serve their needs.
For automotive markets, we developed the first commercially available coated AHSS and GEN3 steels. We are constructing a first of its kind GEN3 hot dipped galvanize line at PRO-TEC and have embedded application engineers at original equipment manufacturers to demonstrate how to best utilize the material in body design to meet automobile passenger safety requirements while significantly reducing weight to meet future vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
In our tubular markets, we continue development of premium and semi-premium tubular connections designed for our customers operating in challenging drilling environments. These connections optimize performance and provide outstanding sealing capabilities for onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling. An example is the USS-EAGLE SFH™ which was introduced in 2017 for customers drilling deep, high-pressure horizontal onshore natural gas and oil wells in North America. Please refer to Item I. Business Strategy for further details of related strategies.
Workforce
At U. S. Steel, we are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce of talented and diverse people — all working together to deliver superior results for our Company, stockholders, customers and communities. We regularly review our human capital needs and prioritize our efforts to sustain and enhance our competitive position in the markets we serve.
Most hourly employees of U. S. Steel’s flat-rolled, tubular, cokemaking and iron ore operations in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the United Steelworkers (USW) entered into effective September 1, 2018 (the 2018 Labor Agreements) that expire on September 1, 2022. The 2018 Labor Agreements include a signing bonus for each eligible USW-represented employee (which was paid in December of 2018) and annual wage increases of 4%, 3.5%, 3.5% and 3% effective September 1, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, the 2018 Labor Agreements provide for certain employee benefit modifications to our defined benefit pension plan and increases to the contribution rate per hour to our multiemployer plan covering certain USW employees from $2.65 per hour to $3.15, $3.35, and $3.50 per hour effective January 1, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2018, U. S. Steel recorded a charge of approximately $81 million for the 2018 Labor Agreements signing bonus and related costs. 
Capital Structure and Liquidity
Our primary financial goal is to enhance stockholder value by utilizing our capital structure, liquidity, and financial flexibility to deploy cash to generate stockholder value. Our cash deployment strategy is aligned to our strategic priorities, and includes: revitalizing our capital, both human and equipment; maintaining a strong balance sheet and a healthy pension plan; and delivering sustainable growth with a focus on core values such as safety and environmental stewardship. Cash deployment is also performed with a customer-centric focus on improving safety, quality, delivery and cost.
Our improved financial profile in 2018 provided us with the opportunity to announce a $300 million stock repurchase program that is authorized through 2020. Together with our common stock dividend, this program represents a sustainable and balanced stockholder return framework within our capital structure. 
Our liquidity supports our ability to satisfy short-term obligations, fund working capital requirements, and provides a foundation to execute key strategic initiatives such as our asset revitalization program.
We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and sustaining improved credit ratings, and may proactively manage our company's debt maturity profile from time to time to protect our capital structure from unforeseen external events and re-financing risks.
In 2018, we undertook several steps to support these goals. The Company issued $650 million of 6.250% Senior Notes due March 15, 2026 and received net proceeds of approximately $640 million, which together with cash on hand was used for a cash tender offer followed by a redemption of all of our outstanding 2021 Senior Secured Notes. We also entered into a fourth amended and restated $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in February 2023. USSK entered into a new €460 million five-year revolving credit facility maturing in September 2023. USSK drew down €200 million (approximately $228 million) from the USSK Credit Agreement. Using available cash on hand together with 
27

funds repatriated from USSK to its parent, U. S. Steel, redeemed all of our outstanding 2020 Senior Notes. During 2018 we reduced debt by $322 million. We ended 2018 with $2.8 billion of total liquidity.
Steel Industry Background and Competition
The global steel industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity.
U. S. Steel's competitive position may be affected by, among other things, differences among U. S. Steel's and its competitors' cost structure, labor costs, environmental remediation and compliance costs, global capacity and the existence and magnitude of government subsidies provided to competitors.
U. S. Steel competes with many North American and international steel producers. Competitors include integrated producers, which, like U. S. Steel, use iron ore and coke as the primary raw materials for steel production, as well as electric arc furnace (EAF) producers, which primarily use steel scrap and other iron-bearing feedstocks as raw materials. Global steel capacity has continued to increase, with some published sources estimating for 2018 that steel capacity in China alone is over one billion metric tonnes per year versus steel demand in China estimated at approximately 800 million metric tonnes. In addition, other materials, such as aluminum, plastics and composites, compete with steel in several applications.
EAF producers typically require lower capital expenditures for construction of facilities and may have lower total employment costs; however, these competitive advantages may be minimized or eliminated by the cost of scrap when scrap prices are high. Some mini-mills utilize thin slab casting technology to produce flat-rolled products and are increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers in many flat-rolled product applications previously produced only by integrated steelmakers.
U. S. Steel provides defined benefit pension and/or other post-employment benefits to approximately 90,000 current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Many of our competitors do not have comparable retiree obligations. Participation in U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on July 1, 2003 and benefit accruals for all non-represented participants were frozen effective December 31, 2015. Participation in U. S. Steel’s retiree medical and life insurance programs for USW-represented employees were closed to employees hired or rehired (except in limited circumstances) on or after January 1, 2016. Retiree medical and life insurance benefits for non-represented employees were eliminated for those who retired after December 31, 2017.
We believe that our major North American and many European integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar environmental regulatory conditions and therefore do not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, if future regulations do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without linking these emissions to steel scrap as well, our competitive position relative to mini-mills will be adversely impacted. Our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations such as China, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Brazil and India, will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in CO2 emissions. Competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted. The specific impact on each competitor will vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods. U. S. Steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Many of our competitors, including North American producers, or their successors, that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such environmental remediation matters.
28

International Trade
U. S. Steel continues to face import competition, much of which is unfairly-traded, supported by foreign governments, and fueled by massive global steel overcapacity. Such practices, policies, and overcapacity impact the Company’s operational and financial performance. U. S. Steel continues to lead the industry in efforts to address these challenges that threaten the Company, our workers, our stockholders, and our country’s national and economic security.
Through a series of Presidential Proclamations pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as of the date of this filing, U.S. imports of certain steel products are subject to a 25 percent tariff, except for imports from: (1) Turkey, which are subject to a 50 percent tariff; (2) Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea, which are subject to restrictive quotas; and (3) Australia, which is not subject to either tariffs or quotas. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) is managing a process in which U.S. companies may request and/or oppose temporary product exclusions from the Section 232 tariffs or quotas. Over 44,000 exclusions have been requested. U. S. Steel is actively opposing exclusion requests for products that are the same as, or substitute products for, those U. S. Steel produces.
Several legal challenges, trade measures, and retaliation actions have been initiated in response to the Section 232 action on steel. In the United States, on December 19, 2018 the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) held oral arguments in the American Institute for International Steel’s constitutional challenge to the Section 232 statute. Multiple countries have challenged the Section 232 action at the World Trade Organization (WTO), imposed retaliatory tariffs, and/or took action to safeguard their domestic steel industries from increased steel imports. Mexico imposed a 25 percent tariff on imports of U.S. steel and other products in June 2018. Canada imposed a countermeasure surtax of 25 percent on imports of U.S. steel and other products in July 2018 and a provisional safeguard in the form of tariff rate quotas (TRQs; 25 percent tariffs on imports that exceed the quota) on certain steel products in October 2018. The European Union imposed 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. steel and other products in June 2018 and imposed a provisional TRQ safeguard on global steel imports in July 2018. Retaliatory tariffs were also imposed by China, India, Russia, and Turkey. In response, the United States challenged the retaliation at the WTO. In November, multiple dispute panels were established for the Section 232 and retaliation disputes. Panel decisions are not expected until the fourth quarter of 2019 at the earliest.
On January 16, 2019, the European Commission (EC) announced its definitive TRQ safeguard on steel imports: 25 percent tariffs on certain steel imports that exceed quotas based on 105 percent of average import volumes for 2015-2017 and increasing 5 percent annually, effective February 2019 through June 2021.
Antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD or antisubsidy) duties currently apply in addition to the Section 232 tariffs and quotas and AD/CVD orders will last beyond the Section 232 action. Thus, U. S. Steel continues to actively defend and maintain the 54 AD/CVD orders and 11 EU AD/CVD orders covering products U. S. Steel produces in proceedings before the DOC, U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), CIT, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the WTO, including the below favorable results achieved in 2018.
On January 30, 2018, the ITC voted to continue the 1995 AD order and current duties of up to 57.72 percent on seamless carbon and alloy steel standard, line, and pressure pipe from Germany for another five years. 
On April 12, 2018, DOC announced the final results of the second administrative review of the AD order on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from Korea, assigning AD rates of up to 75.81 percent.
On May 17, 2018, in response to circumvention petitions filed by U. S. Steel and other domestic steel producers in September 2016, the DOC found that imports of cold-rolled and corrosion-resistant steel made from Chinese substrate are covered by the AD/CVD orders on such imports from China. As a result of the DOC final determination, U.S. imports of cold-rolled steel from Vietnam made from Chinese hot-rolled steel are subject to 522.23 percent cash deposit requirements and U.S. imports of corrosion-resistant steel from Vietnam made from Chinese hot- or cold-rolled steel are subject to 238.48 percent cash deposit requirements, both retroactive to November 4, 2016. In December 2018, the CIT dismissed all appeals of DOC's circumvention determinations. In August 2018, in response to additional similar circumvention petitions filed in June 2018 by U. S. Steel and other domestic producers,  DOC initiated circumvention investigations on: (1) imports of cold-rolled and corrosion-resistant steel from Vietnam made from Korean substrate; and (2) imports of corrosion-resistant steel from Vietnam made from Taiwanese substrate.  
On May 31, 2018 the ITC voted to continue the 2000 AD order and duties of up to 95.29 percent on tin mill products from Japan for another five years.
29

In August through November 2018, the DOC announced the preliminary results of the first administrative reviews of the 2016 AD/CVD orders on hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and corrosion-resistant steel, with final results due four to six months after the preliminary results.
Following an investigation of China’s technology transfer and intellectual property violations by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, approximately $250 billion of U.S. imports from China, including finished steel couplings and some products used in steel production, are subject to 10 to 25 percent tariffs. On December 1, 2018, President Trump and Chinese President Xi agreed to a 90-day pause in the escalation of trade measures and continued negotiations on structural trade issues, including China's subsidies and government support of its steel industry. Though an agreement has not been publicly released, it appears to include a commitment by China to import more U.S. products (particularly agricultural products) and a commitment by the U.S. to delay the increase of the current Section 301 tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S. from 10 percent to 25 percent as was planned to occur on January 1, 2019. 
On November 30, 2018, the leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a new free trade agreement that is intended to replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement. USMCA contains several new provisions designed to increase the use of USMCA-origin steel and increase trade enforcement coordination among the three countries. To become law, the USMCA must be ratified and implemented by the three governments. The signing of USMCA does not change the current Section 232 steel action or retaliation thereto. 
The G-20’s Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, created in 2016, continues to work to reduce global steel overcapacity, including agreeing on six principles and specific policy recommendations to address excess steel capacity in November 2017 and issuing a September 20, 2018 Ministerial Report on progress thus far. The Global Forum’s stated goal for 2019 is the full implementation of such principles and policy recommendations. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Steel Committee and trilateral negotiations between the United States, EU, and Japan also continue to address global steel overcapacity. On January 9, 2019, the United States, EU, and Japan issued a joint statement instructing the finalization of text for proposals to reform WTO subsidies rules to address overcapacity by Spring 2019.
U. S. Steel continues to execute a broad, global strategy to maximize opportunities and navigate challenges presented by imports, global steel overcapacity, and international trade law and policy developments.

Other Businesses
U. S. Steel’s Other Businesses include railroad services and real estate operations.
U. S. Steel owns the Gary Railway Company in Indiana, Lake Terminal Railroad Company and Lorain Northern Company in Ohio, Union Railroad Company, LLC in Pennsylvania, Fairfield Southern Company, Inc. in Alabama, Delray Connecting Railroad Company in Michigan and Texas & Northern Railroad Company in Texas. These entities comprise U. S. Steel’s transportation business. 
U. S. Steel owns, develops and manages various real estate assets, which include approximately 50,000 acres of surface rights primarily in Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Illinois. In addition, U. S. Steel holds ownership interests in a joint venture that is developing real estate projects in Alabama. 
Raw Materials and Energy
As an integrated producer, U. S. Steel’s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore, carbon units in the form of coal and coke (which is produced from coking coal) and steel scrap. U. S. Steel’s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of certain primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain other raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time.
The amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel producing equipment. In broad terms, U. S. Steel consumes approximately 1.4 tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and then it consumes approximately 0.3 tons of coke, 0.3 tons of steel scrap (45 percent of which is internally generated) and 1.3 tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 6 mmbtu’s of natural gas per ton produced. While we believe that these estimated consumption amounts are useful for planning purposes, and are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production, substantial variations may occur.
Iron Ore
Iron Ore Production(a)
(a) Includes our share of production from Hibbing through December 31, 2018 and Tilden to September 29, 2017. U. S. Steel's ownership interest in Tilden was sold on September 29, 2017. The decrease in iron ore production from 2014 is primarily related to the idling of our Keetac facility. In 2017, the Keetac facility restarted production.
The iron ore facilities at Minntac and Keetac contain an estimated 838 million short tons of recoverable reserves and our share of recoverable reserves at the Hibbing joint venture is 7 million short tons. Recoverable reserves are defined as the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses. Minntac and Keetac’s annual capability and our share of annual capability for the Hibbing joint 
35

venture total approximately 24 million tons. Through our wholly owned operations and our share of our joint venture, we have iron ore pellet production capability that exceeds our steelmaking capability in the U.S. 
We sold iron ore pellets in 2018, 2017 and 2016 to third parties. The Company has agreements to supply iron ore pellets to third-party customers over the next several years. 
Substantially all of USSE’s iron ore requirements are purchased from outside sources, primarily Russian and Ukrainian mining companies. Prices for European contracts are negotiated quarterly. In certain prior years, USSE also received iron ore from U. S. Steel’s iron ore facilities in North America. We believe that supplies of iron ore adequate to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices.
Coking Coal
All of U. S. Steel’s coal requirements for our cokemaking facilities are purchased from outside sources. Pricing for Flat-Rolled's coking coal contracts are typically negotiated on a yearly basis, and from time to time we have entered into multi-year agreements for a portion of our coking coal requirements. 
Prices for European contracts are negotiated at defined intervals, predominantly annually.
We believe that supplies of coking coal adequate to meet our needs are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. The main source of coking coal for Flat-Rolled is the United States, and sources for USSE include Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, Mozambique and the United States.
Coke
Coke Production(a)
(a) The decrease in 2016 coke production from 2015 was due to decreased internal steel production and depletion of existing coke inventory. The decrease in 2015 coke production from 2014 is due to the permanent shutdown of coke operations at Gary Works and Granite City Works.
In North America, the Flat-Rolled segment operates a cokemaking facility at the Clairton Plant of Mon Valley Works. At our Granite City Works, we also have a 15-year coke supply agreement with Gateway which began in 2009. Blast furnace injection of coal, and self-generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage. 
With Flat-Rolled’s cokemaking facilities and the Gateway long-term supply agreement, it has the capability to be nearly self-sufficient with respect to its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels. Coke from time to time has been purchased from, sold to, or swapped with suppliers and other end-users to adjust for production needs and reduce transportation costs.
In Europe, the USSE segment operates cokemaking facilities at USSK. While USSE is self-sufficient for coke at normal operating levels, it periodically purchases coke from Polish and Czech coke producers to meet production needs. Volume and price are negotiated quarterly.
36

Steel Scrap and Other Materials
We believe that supplies of steel scrap, alloys and coating materials adequate to meet our needs to support Flat-Rolled and USSE are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices. Generally, approximately 45 percent of our steel scrap requirements are internally generated through normal operations.
Limestone
All of Flat-Rolled’s and USSE's limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources. We believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices.
Zinc and Tin
We believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill the requirements for Flat-Rolled and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. For Flat-Rolled, the main sources of zinc are Canada, Peru and Mexico and the main sources of tin are Bolivia and Peru. For USSE, the main sources of zinc are Sweden, the Slovak Republic, Netherlands and Poland and the main sources of tin are Bolivia, Indonesia and Peru. 
During 2018, Flat-Rolled protected approximately 45% and 50% of its operation's zinc and tin purchases, respectively, with financial swap derivatives to manage exposure to zinc and tin price fluctuations. During 2018, USSE protected approximately 30% of its operation's zinc purchases with forward physical contracts to manage exposure to zinc price fluctuations. Also during 2018, USSE protected approximately 25% of its operation's tin purchases with forward physical contracts and 15% of its operation's tin purchases with financial swaps to manage our exposure to tin price fluctuations. For further information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Natural Gas
All of U. S. Steel’s natural gas requirements are purchased from outside sources.
We believe that adequate supplies to meet Flat-Rolled’s and Tubular's needs are available at competitive market prices. For 2018, approximately 20 percent of our natural gas purchases in Flat-Rolled were based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors; the remainder were made daily or with term agreements. 
We believe that adequate natural gas supplies to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices. During 2018, we routinely executed fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases. For 2018, approximately 55 percent of our natural gas purchases in USSE were made with fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts; the remainder were based on bids solicited on a quarterly, monthly or a daily basis from various vendors.
Both Flat-Rolled and USSE use self-generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas. USSE also captures and consumes converter gas from its four steelmaking vessels.
Industrial Gases
U. S. Steel purchases industrial gas in the U.S. under long-term contracts with various suppliers. USSE owns and operates its own industrial gas facilities, but also may purchase industrial gases from time to time.
Commercial Sales of Product 
U. S. Steel characterizes sales as contract sales if sold pursuant to an agreement with a defined volume and pricing and a duration of longer than three months, and as spot if sold without a defined volume and pricing agreement. In 2018, approximately 80 percent, 70 percent and 28 percent of sales by Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular, respectively, were contract sales. Some contract pricing agreements include fixed prices while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components. 
37

Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies
Some of U. S. Steel’s facilities were in operation before 1900. Although management believes that U. S. Steel’s environmental practices have either led the industry or at least been consistent with prevailing industry practices, hazardous materials may have been released at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties.
Our U.S. facilities are subject to environmental laws applicable in the U.S., including the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as state and local laws and regulations.
U. S. Steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating, and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, related to release of hazardous materials, which in recent years have been mainly for process changes to meet CAA obligations and similar obligations in Europe.
Midwest Plant Incident
On April 11, 2017, there was a process waste water release at our Midwest Plant (Midwest) in Portage, Indiana that impacted a water outfall that discharges to Burns Waterway near Lake Michigan. U. S. Steel identified the source of the release and made the necessary repairs.  We determined that all repairs were safely working as intended and, on April 14, 2017, resumed operations in a controlled, phased and highly monitored approach with extensive input from participating government agencies. The Company has since implemented substantial operational, process and notification improvements at Midwest. In January of 2018, The Surfrider Foundation and the City of Chicago initiated suits in the Northern District of Indiana alleging CWA and Permit violations at Midwest. On April 2, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the State of Indiana initiated a separate action against the Company and lodged a Consent Decree negotiated between U. S. Steel and the relevant governmental agencies consisting of all material terms to resolve the CWA and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) violations at the Midwest Plant. A public comment period for the Consent Decree ensued. U. S. Steel, U.S. EPA and the State of Indiana continue the process of reviewing and addressing those comments. The Surfrider Foundation and the City of Chicago initially agreed to stay their actions pending finalization of the Consent Decree, but filed a motion to lift that stay in July 2018. On September 13, 2018, both The Surfrider Foundation and the City of Chicago filed motions to intervene in the Consent Decree case. On December 6, 2018, the court denied the Surfrider Foundation and City of Chicago's motion to lift the stay in the citizen suit case, and on December 13, 2018 the court granted the Surfider Foundation and City of Chicago's motion to intervene in the Consent Decree case. The citizens groups filed their Complaints-in-Intervention on December 27, 2018, and Amended Complaints-in-Intervention on January 17, 2019. U. S. Steel continues to work with United States Department of Justice, U.S. EPA, and Indiana Department of Environmental Management towards a finalized Consent Decree. 
EU Environmental Requirements and Slovak Operations
Under the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), USSK's final allocation of free allowances for the Phase III period, which covers the years 2013 through 2020 is 48 million allowances. We estimate a shortfall of approximately 15 million allowances for the Phase III period. Based on projected future production levels, we started to purchase allowances in the third quarter of 2017 to meet the annual compliance submission in the future. As of December 31, 2018, we have purchased approximately 11 million European Union Allowances totaling €118 million (approximately $135 million). However, due to a number of variables such as the future market value of allowances, future production levels and future emissions intensity levels, we cannot reliably estimate the full cost of complying with the ETS regulations at this time. 
The EU’s Industry Emission Directive requires implementation of EU determined best available techniques (BAT) for iron and steel production, to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with BAT associated emission levels. Our most recent broad estimate of future capital expenditures for projects that go beyond BAT requirements is up to €138 million (approximately $158 million) over the 2017 to 2020 program period. These costs may be mitigated if USSK complies with certain financial covenants, which are assessed annually. USSK complied with these covenants as of December 31, 2018. If we are unable to meet these covenants in the future, USSK might be required to provide additional collateral (e.g. bank guarantee) to secure the full value of estimated expenditures. There could be increased operating costs associated with these projects, such as increased energy and maintenance costs. We are currently unable to reliably estimate what the increase in operating costs will be as many projects are still in the development stage.

Due to other EU legislation, BAT for Large Combustion Plants (LCP), we were required to make changes to the boilers at our steam and power generation plant in order to comply with stricter air emission limits for large combustion plants. The requirements for LCP resulted in the construction of a new boiler and certain upgrades to our existing boilers. In January 2014, the operation of USSK's boilers was approved by the European Commission (EC) as part of Slovakia's Transitional National Plan (TNP) for bringing all boilers in Slovakia into compliance by no later than 2020. The TNP establishes emissions ceilings for each category of emissions (total suspended particulate, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxide (NOx)). The allowable amount of discharged emissions from existing boilers will decrease each year until mid-2020. These projects will result in a reduction in electricity, emissions, and operating, maintenance and waste disposal costs. The construction of both boilers is complete with a total final installed cost of €128 million (approximately $147 million).
For further discussion of laws applicable in Slovakia and the EU and their impact on USSK, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Contingencies and Commitments - Environmental Matters, EU Environmental Requirements.”
New and Emerging Environmental Regulations
United States and European Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulations
Future compliance with CO2 emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems. Because we cannot predict what requirements ultimately will be imposed in the U.S. and Europe, it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on U. S. Steel, but it could be substantial. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 instructing the U.S. EPA to review the Clean Power Plan. On October 16, 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan after reviewing the plan pursuant to President Trump’s executive order. Any repeal and/or replacement of the Clean Power Plan is likely to be challenged by various proponents of the plan, such as environmental groups and certain states. Any impacts to our operations as a result of any future greenhouse gas regulations are not estimable at this time since the matter is unsettled. In any case, to the extent expenditures associated with any greenhouse gas regulation, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of U. S. Steel's products and services, operating results will be reduced.
There have been no material changes in U. S. Steel’s exposure to European Greenhouse Gas Emissions regulations since December 31, 2017.
United States - Air
The CAA imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions. The CAA requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards. The U.S. EPA has developed various industry-specific MACT standards pursuant to this requirement. The CAA requires the U.S. EPA to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of Hazardous Air Pollutants. The U.S. EPA also must conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to MACT standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks.
While our operations are subject to several different categories of NESHAP and MACT standards, the principal impact of these standards on U. S. Steel operations includes those that are specific to coke making, iron making, steel making and iron ore processing.
The U.S. EPA is currently in the process of completing a Residual Risk and Technology Review of the Integrated Iron and Steel MACT regulations, Coke MACT regulations, and Taconite Iron Ore Processing MACT regulations as required by the CAA. The U.S. EPA is under a court order to complete the Residual Risk and Technology Review of the Integrated Iron and Steel regulations no later than March 13, 2020; and to complete the Residual Risk and Technology Review of the Taconite Iron Ore Processing Regulations by June 30, 2020. Because the U.S. EPA has not completed its review, any impacts related to the U.S. EPA’s review of these standards cannot be estimated at this time.

On March 12, 2018, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) submitted a CAA Section 126 petition to the U.S. EPA. In the petition, the DEC asserts that stationary sources from the following nine states are interfering with attainment or maintenance of the 2008 and 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in New York, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. DEC is requesting the U.S. EPA to require sources of nitrogen oxides in the nine states to reduce such emissions. On May 4, 2018, citing Section 307(d)(10) of the CAA, the U.S. EPA issued a notice extending the deadline for the agency to respond to the petition until November 9, 2018. However, to date, U.S. EPA has not responded to the petition.
The CAA also requires the U.S. EPA to develop and implement NAAQS for criteria pollutants, which include, among others, particulate matter (PM) - consisting of PM10 and PM2.5, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, SO2, and ozone. 
In June 2010, the U.S. EPA significantly lowered the primary NAAQS for SO2 from 140 parts per billion (ppb) on a 24-hour basis to an hourly standard of 75 ppb. Subsequently, the U.S. EPA designated the areas in which Great Lakes Works and Mon Valley Works facilities are located as nonattainment with the 2010 standard for the SO2 NAAQS. The non-attainment designation requires the facilities to implement operational and/or capital improvements to demonstrate attainment with the 2010 standard. U. S. Steel worked with the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) in developing a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Allegheny County portion of the Pennsylvania SIP that includes reductions of SO2 and improved dispersion from U. S. Steel sources. On November 19, 2018, U.S. EPA published a proposed rule to approve the SIP. Comments on the proposed rule were accepted until December 19, 2018. In addition, as noted in the Legal Proceedings section, U. S. Steel continues to work with the regulatory authorities to address the Wayne County, Michigan (where Great Lakes Works is located) nonattainment status. The operational and financial impacts of the SO2 NAAQS is not estimated to be material at this time.
In October 2015, the U.S. EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. On November 6, 2017, the U.S. EPA designated most areas in which we operate as attainment with the 2015 standard. In a separate ruling, on June 4, 2018, the U.S. EPA designated other areas in which we operate as “marginal nonattainment” with the 2015 ozone standard. While on December 6, 2018, U.S. EPA published a final rule regarding implementation of the 2015 ozone standard. Because no state regulatory or permitting actions to bring the ozone nonattainment areas into attainment have yet to be proposed or developed for U. S. Steel facilities, the operational and financial impact of the ozone NAAQS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
On December 14, 2012, the U.S. EPA lowered the annual standard for PM2.5 from 15 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 12 ug/m3, and retained the PM2.5 24-hour and PM10 NAAQS rules. In December 2014, the U.S. EPA designated some areas in which U. S. Steel operates as nonattainment with the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard. On April 6, 2018, the U.S. EPA published a notice that Pennsylvania, California and Idaho failed to submit a SIP to demonstrate attainment with the 2012 fine particulate standard by the deadline established by the CAA. As a result of the notice, Pennsylvania, a state in which we operate, is required to submit a SIP to the U.S. EPA no later than November 7, 2019 to avoid sanctions. Because it is early in the SIP development stages, any impacts to U. S. Steel cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
In 2010, the U.S. EPA retained the annual nitrogen dioxide NAAQS standard, but created a new 1-hour NAAQS and established new data reduction and monitoring requirements. While the U.S. EPA has classified all areas as being in attainment or unclassifiable, it is requiring implementation of a network of monitoring stations to assess air quality. Until the network is implemented and further designations are made, the impact on operations at U. S. Steel facilities cannot be reasonably estimated.
In July 2018, the ACHD provided U. S. Steel, ACHD Regulation Subcommittee members and interested parties with draft regulations that would modify the existing air regulations applicable to coke plants in Allegheny County. While ACHD currently has some of the most stringent air regulations in the country governing coke plants, which apply to U. S. Steel’s coke plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania (the only remaining coke plant in Allegheny County and one of two remaining in Pennsylvania), the draft regulations would reduce the current allowable emissions from coke plant operations and would be more stringent than the Federal Best Available Control Technology and Lowest Achievable Emission Rate requirements. In various meetings with ACHD, U. S. Steel has raised significant objections, in particular, that ACHD has not demonstrated that continuous compliance with the draft rule is economically and technologically feasible. While U. S. Steel continues to meet with ACHD regarding the draft rule, U. S. Steel believes that any rule promulgated by ACHD must comply with their statutory authority. Adopting the draft rule or similar rule could be material to U. S. Steel.

Environmental Remediation
In the United States, U. S. Steel has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at nine sites under CERCLA as of December 31, 2018. Of these, there are three sites where information requests have been received or there are other indications that U. S. Steel may be a PRP under CERCLA, but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make a reasonable estimate with respect to any potential liabilities. There are also 18 additional sites where U. S. Steel may be liable for remediation costs in excess of $100,000 under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or where private parties are seeking to impose liability on U. S. Steel for remediation costs through discussions or litigation. At many of these sites, U. S. Steel is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well as U. S. Steel’s share, is frequently dependent upon the outcome of ongoing investigations and remedial studies. U. S. Steel accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably estimable. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.

Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, U. S. Steel had approximately 17,000 employees in the U.S. and approximately 12,000 in Europe.
Approximately 14,000 hourly employees of U. S. Steel’s flat-rolled, tubular, cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the USW effective September 1, 2018 (the 2018 Labor Agreements) that expire on September 1, 2022. The 2018 Labor Agreements provide for wage, pension and other benefit adjustments for current and future retirees. For more details on the 2018 Labor Agreements, see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A small number of workers at some of our North American facilities and at our transportation operations are covered by agreements with the USW or other unions that have various expiration dates.
In Europe, excluding U.S. expatriates, most employees at USSK are represented by the OZ KOVO union and all employees are covered by an agreement that expires at the end of March 2020.
