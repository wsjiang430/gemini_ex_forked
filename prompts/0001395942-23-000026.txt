Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a leading digital marketplace for used vehicles, connecting sellers and buyers across North America and Europe to facilitate fast, easy and transparent transactions. Our portfolio of integrated technology, data analytics, financing, logistics, reconditioning and other remarketing solutions, combined with our vehicle logistics centers in Canada, help advance our purpose: to make wholesale easy so our customers can be more successful. 
In 2022, our marketplaces facilitated the sale of approximately 1.3 million used vehicles. Vehicles on our marketplaces are typically sold by commercial sellers including vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies, financial institutions, commercial fleet operators and rental car companies, as well as used vehicle dealers, to franchised and independent used vehicle dealers. We generate revenue through auction fees charged to vehicle sellers and buyers as well as by providing value-added ancillary products and services, including transportation logistics, reconditioning, vehicle inspection and certification, titling, administrative and collateral recovery services and floorplan financing. We facilitate the transfer of ownership directly from seller to buyer and, generally, we do not take title to, nor ownership of, vehicles sold through our marketplaces.
For our commercial sellers, our OPENLANE software platform supports more than 40 private label digital remarketing sites and provides comprehensive solutions to our automobile manufacturer, captive finance company and other commercial customers. 
For dealer customers, the Company also operates BacklotCars and TradeRev digital marketplace platforms that facilitate real-time transactions between automotive dealers, coast-to-coast in the United States and Canada. The CARWAVE digital auction platform was integrated with BacklotCars in the fourth quarter of 2022, adding additional features and functionality to the BacklotCars marketplace, including a live auction format that allows dealers to sell and source inventory in a fast-paced, head-to-head bidding environment. 
An important component of our services to buyers is providing short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing. This is provided primarily to independent used vehicle dealers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, AFC, which has approximately 100 locations throughout North America.
The Company also operates the ADESA Simulcast and Simulcast+ technology that supports marketplace sales at our vehicle logistics centers in Canada. This proprietary technology is also sold and licensed to other auction providers, including independent auctions in North America. The Company also owns and operates ADESA U.K., an online wholesale used vehicle remarketing business in the United Kingdom and ADESA Europe, an online wholesale vehicle marketplace in Continental Europe. In January 2023, ADESA U.K. and ADESA Europe were consolidated into one platform. We believe our geographic network and diverse product offerings enable us to leverage relationships with providers and buyers of used vehicles.
Utilizing our proprietary technology, we also provide auction platforms for third parties. Generally, this revenue is generated on a per vehicle basis, but we do not include these transactions in our vehicle sold numbers.
In May 2022, the ADESA U.S. physical auction business was sold to Carvana and included all auction sales, operations and staff at ADESA’s U.S. vehicle logistics centers and use of the ADESA.com marketplace in the U.S.
Our Corporate History
ADESA entered the vehicle remarketing industry in 1989 and first became a public company in 1992. In 1994, ADESA acquired AFC. ADESA remained a public company until 1995, and then became public again in 2004. KAR was incorporated in 2006 and acquired ADESA and IAA in 2007, taking ADESA private. KAR became a public company in 2009. In 2019, IAA was separated from KAR through a tax-free spin-off and now operates as a separate public company (NYSE: IAA). In 2022, KAR sold the ADESA U.S. physical auction business to Carvana.
Our Industry
Wholesale used vehicles are generally sold through marketplaces that bring together sellers and buyers to facilitate transactions. Wholesale used vehicles include vehicles from dealers turning their inventory, off-lease vehicles, vehicles repossessed by financial institutions and rental and other fleet vehicles that have reached a predetermined age or mileage. The following are key industry highlights:
Wholesale Used Vehicle Industry Volumes
We believe the U.S. and Canadian wholesale used vehicle industry has a total addressable market of approximately 20 million vehicles, which can fluctuate depending on seasonality and a variety of other macro-economic factors. This wholesale used vehicle industry consists of the commercial market (commercial sellers that sell to franchise and independent dealers) and the dealer-to-dealer market (franchise and independent dealers that both buy and sell vehicles). The Company supports the majority of commercial sellers in North America through our OPENLANE technology. We believe digital applications, such as BacklotCars and TradeRev, may provide an opportunity to expand the total addressable market for dealer-to-dealer transactions. The supply chain issues and current market conditions facing the automotive industry, including the disruption of new vehicle production, low new vehicle supply and historically high used vehicle pricing have had a material impact on the wholesale used vehicle industry.
Wholesale Used Vehicle Market
In the North American wholesale used vehicle marketplace industry, the largest providers of physical auctions include Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., and the ADESA U.S. physical auction business. In the North American wholesale used vehicle marketplace industry, the largest providers of digital marketplaces include the Company and ACV Auctions. There are several other providers in the market of varying size. Over the last several years, industry transactions have been increasingly shifting from physical marketplace venues to digital marketplace channels. This shift has attracted the entry of several new technology-driven marketplace participants, who are generally smaller in size and service more select segments of buyers and sellers.
Floorplan Financing
An important component of the wholesale used vehicle industry is the availability of short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing. By providing buyers (primarily independent used vehicle dealers) access to capital, the independent used vehicle dealers are able to place inventory on their lots. AFC and its competitors play a significant role in the wholesale used vehicle industry by providing liquidity in our marketplaces. In addition, AFC's floorplan financing also supports independent used vehicle dealers with non-auction purchases and value-added services that generate fee-based, non-interest revenue.
Our Business Strategy
KAR’s strategy is to build the world’s greatest digital marketplaces for used vehicles, and we are advancing this strategy by fulfilling our purpose, to make wholesale easy so our customers can be more successful. This progressive strategy reflects the shifting landscape of the remarketing industry and automotive sector, the evolving needs and expectations of our customers and the opportunities that emerged and accelerated with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The strategy builds on KAR’s integrated technology, broad data analytics capabilities, and portfolio of financing, logistics, reconditioning and other remarketing solutions. 
We are committed to the digital transformation of wholesale automotive remarketing. We believe digital platforms benefit sellers by attracting a larger buyer-base, providing greater flexibility around when and where to launch sales, and enabling more advanced and targeted marketing techniques. We believe buyers benefit from digital platforms through greater transparency, access to inventory beyond their local market, and the ability to browse, bid and buy safely and conveniently from any location, on any device, at any time. For KAR, going digital enables a faster, more agile and asset-light operating model, which should in turn deliver greater value to our stakeholders.
KAR has identified five strategic priorities that we believe will advance our strategy and continue to position our company for the future. Those priorities are:
•Digital transformation;
•Growing dealer consignment; 
•Expanding our commercial business;
•Delivering strong performance in our floorplan business; and
•Simplification.
Digital transformation: The cornerstone of digital transformation is technology, so we intend to continue to invest in our digital platforms, data analytics capabilities and digital talent to power our marketplaces. We are transforming our operating model and enabling functions to support KAR’s digital future. 
•Enabling capabilities: We understand that as transactions become more digital, our capabilities need to evolve to meet the increased customer needs and expectations in a digital marketplace. We are enhancing our imaging, inspection and vehicle representation capabilities to more closely simulate seeing and touching a vehicle in person. We also intend to continue to build on and diversify our data and analytics capabilities, providing our customers with actionable information to help them make better, more informed buying and selling decisions.
•Talent: Our shift to a digital model has enabled us to become a more efficient organization. We are reducing our overall cost structure while increasing resource levels in our technology, engineering, analytics and product development teams. We will continue to evaluate our talent pool and seek new talent where necessary to advance our strategy and support our customers. 
•Vehicle logistics center locations and operations: In our Canadian market, our vehicle logistics center locations provide comprehensive services to on-premise and off-premise customers, including inspection, reconditioning, mechanical work, storage and logistics. 
Growing dealer consignment: The dealer consignment business represents approximately one-third of the Company’s historical transactional volume, and we believe this is an area with significant opportunity for growth. Over the past several years, KAR has completed three strategic acquisitions to help capture greater share in this space: BacklotCars, CARWAVE and TradeRev. The platforms provide dealers with fast, easy, mobile-app solutions to sell and source inventory from other dealers. They also provide comprehensive vehicle condition reports, greater transparency into bidding activity, and real-time market price discovery on listed vehicles. The Company is integrating and leveraging technology, capabilities and staff from these businesses to deliver what we believe will be the best digital dealer-to-dealer solution in the market.
Expanding our commercial business: The commercial consignment business represents approximately two-thirds of the Company’s historical transactional volume, and growing our share in this area remains a strategic priority. The foundation of KAR’s commercial offering is OPENLANE, the digital platform powering more than 40 private label websites for our commercial OEM and financial institution consignor customers. We continue to invest in staff and technology to enhance the digital experience for our commercial customers using any of our multiple platforms. 
Delivering strong performance in our floorplan business: AFC is a leading provider of floorplan financing and affiliated solutions to independent dealers across North America. We are focused on increasing the attach rate of our finance offerings across our marketplaces, growing share across the broader floorplan finance market, and deploying innovative new, non-interest, fee-based services and offerings. Additionally, AFC maintains best-in-class safeguards and processes to identify, mitigate and manage risk across their portfolio. We believe AFC’s local presence, centralized services and processing, and their pipeline of innovation position the floorplan business well for continued growth and contribution to KAR’s overall results.
Simplification: Ultimately, the transition to a fully digital business enables us to simplify our business which will benefit our customers, our employees and our stockholders. We are actively consolidating technology platforms to leverage the best features and capabilities from across our offerings, provide dealers with greater choice and flexibility, and deliver an easier, more streamlined customer experience. We are also working towards centralizing many key customer support and administrative functions to ensure a faster, more predictable and consistent experience for our customers. As these consolidation efforts progress, we expect increased engagement from our dealers, increased efficiency in our technology development and operations, and improved results across our marketplace business. Additionally, a more simplified business will help us focus our investments, accelerate the pace of innovation and manage our operating costs to the evolving market realities of our business.
Our Business Segments
We operate as two reportable business segments: Marketplace (formerly referenced as ADESA Auctions) and Finance (formerly referenced as AFC). Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were distributed as follows: Marketplace 75% and Finance 25%. 
Marketplace
Overview
KAR is committed to leading the digital transformation of the wholesale automotive remarketing industry and supporting our customers by providing fast and transparent digital marketplaces for buying and selling used vehicles. In May 2022, the ADESA U.S. physical auction business was sold to Carvana and included all auction sales, operations and staff at ADESA’s U.S. vehicle logistics centers and use of the ADESA.com marketplace in the United States. The ADESA U.S. physical auction business was formerly a part of the Marketplace segment. 
With the sale of these physical auctions, we further aligned our operations with our digital strategy and reinforced our commitment to leading the digital transformation of our industry. The Marketplace segment serves a domestic and international customer base through digital marketplaces for wholesale vehicles that allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles. Our marketplace offerings allow us to offer vehicles for sale from any location. Our vehicle logistics centers in Canada facilitate on-premise marketplace sales utilizing primarily our ADESA Simulcast and Simulcast+ technology. Digital marketplace sales are initiated online and include OPENLANE, BacklotCars, TradeRev and ADESA Europe sales. The CARWAVE digital marketplace was integrated with BacklotCars in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Vehicles available on our marketplaces include vehicles from commercial customers such as off-lease vehicles, repossessed vehicles, rental vehicles and other fleet vehicles that have reached a predetermined age or mileage, as well as vehicles from used vehicle dealers turning their inventory. The number of vehicles offered for sale on our marketplaces is the key driver of our costs incurred, and the number of vehicles sold is the key driver of the revenues generated by our marketplaces.
We offer online and mobile wholesale vehicle marketplaces, as well as value-enhancing ancillary services in an effective and efficient manner to maximize returns for the sellers of used vehicles. We transfer the vehicles and ownership to the buyer and the net funds to the seller. Our online marketplaces function 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing our customers with maximum exposure for their vehicles and the flexibility to offer vehicles at "buy now" prices or via marketplace sales that last for a few hours, days or even weeks. We also provide customized "private label" selling systems (including "buy now" functionality as well as other online sales formats) for our customers. At most ADESA Canada vehicle logistics center locations, vehicles are typically offered for sale on at least a weekly basis and the marketplace sales are streamed using our ADESA Simulcast and Simulcast+ technology so that remote bidders can participate via our online products.
We generate revenue from auction fees paid by vehicle buyers and sellers, as well as fees from related services. Generally, we do not take title to or bear the risk of loss for vehicles sold on our marketplaces. Our buyer fees are typically based on a tiered structure with fees increasing with the sale price of the vehicle, while seller fees are typically fixed. We add buyer fees to the gross sales price paid by buyers for each vehicle, and generally customers do not receive title or possession of vehicles after purchase until payment is received, proof of floorplan financing is provided or credit is approved. We generally deduct seller fees and other ancillary service fees to sellers from the gross sales price of each vehicle before remitting the net amount to the seller. 
We also sell vehicles that have been purchased, which represent approximately 1% of the total volume of vehicles sold. The vehicles that are purchased by us (as opposed to consigned) are remarketed on our own behalf through our marketplace platforms. Since these vehicle titles transfer to us, the entire selling and purchase price of the vehicle is recorded as revenue and cost of services upon sale.
Customers
Suppliers of vehicles to our digital marketplaces primarily include (i) vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance subsidiaries, vehicle rental companies, financial institutions, and commercial fleets and fleet management companies (collectively "commercial customers"); and (ii) franchised and independent used vehicle dealers (collectively "dealer customers"). Buyers of vehicles on our marketplace platforms primarily include dealer customers. 
Services
Our digital marketplaces also provide a full range of innovative and value-added services to sellers and buyers that enable us to serve as a "one-stop shop" to service our customers' needs. These services include pre and post-sale inspections, key replacement, transportation and logistics, title services and floorplan financing. For vehicles at our vehicle logistics centers, we can also provide reconditioning and mechanical work. Many of these services may be provided or purchased independently from the marketplaces, including:

Services | Description 
Digital Marketplace Services | We provide marketing and advertising for the vehicles on our marketplaces, dealer registration, storage and security of consigned inventory, marketplace vehicle registration, condition report processing, photo services, pre-sale lineups, sales of vehicles by licensed auctioneers, arbitration of disputes, post-sale inspections, title processing, clearing of funds and sales results reports.


Transportation Services | We provide transportation services utilizing our own equipment and personnel as well as licensed and insured third party carriers. Through our subsidiary, CarsArrive, and its proprietary system which provides automated vehicle shipping services, customers can instantly review price quotes and delivery times, and vehicle transporters can check available loads and also receive instant notification of available shipments. The same system is generally utilized across our marketplaces; however, CarsArrive also arranges transportation for vehicles not sold on our marketplaces. 
Reconditioning Services | Our vehicle logistics centers provide detailing, body work, paintless dent repair ("PDR"), light mechanical work, glass repair, tire and key replacement and upholstery repair. Key replacement services are primarily provided by our subsidiary, High Tech Locksmiths ("HTL") and are also offered to digital marketplace participants and other non-marketplace customers. 
Inspection Services | We inspect many of the vehicles that are offered for sale in our marketplaces through a combination of our employees and third parties using our proprietary technologies. In addition, AutoVIN provides vehicle condition reporting, inventory verification auditing, program compliance auditing and facility inspections. Field managers are equipped with handheld computers and digital cameras to record all inspection and audit data on-site. The same technology is utilized at our vehicle logistics center locations, and we believe that the expanded utilization of comprehensive vehicle condition reports with pictures, video and sound facilitates dealers sourcing vehicles digitally.
Title and Repossession Administration and Remarketing Services | PAR provides end-to-end management of the remarketing process for repossession customers including titling, repossession administration, inventory management, marketplace selection, pricing and vehicle representation. Recovery Database Network, Inc. ("RDN") is a specialized provider of B2B software and data solutions for automotive lenders and repossession companies. Clearplan is closely integrated with RDN, providing users with convenient data-flows and access to its recovery management platform. 
Vehicle Research Services | Through our subsidiary, Autoniq, we provide dealers real-time vehicle information such as pricing, history reports and market guides. Autoniq's mobile app allows dealers to scan VINs using their mobile device, view marketplace offered lists and instantly access vehicle history reports and market value reports. Autoniq offers access to vehicle history resources such as CARFAX and AutoCheck, as well as pricing guides such as Black Book, Kelley Blue Book, J.D. Power and Galves. Our offering also includes a comprehensive wholesale and retail market report for all markets in the United States. 

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing approach is to develop strong, mutually beneficial and long-lasting relationships with our customers. We have relationship managers for the various commercial customers, including vehicle manufacturers, fleet companies, rental car companies, finance companies and others. These relationship managers focus on current trends and customer needs for their respective customers in order to better coordinate our sales effort and service offerings.
We also have local sales representatives who have experience in the used vehicle business and an intimate knowledge of local markets. These local representatives focus on the dealer sellers and buyers and are complemented by a centralized team of inventory consultants matching buyers and inventory. Both the local sales representatives and the inventory consultants are managed by a corporate-level team focused on developing and implementing standard best practices and expanding relationships with major dealer groups. We believe this combination of a centralized structure with decentralized resources enhances relationships with the local dealer community and may further increase dealer consignment business on our marketplaces.
We also provide market analysis to our customers, as they use analytical techniques in making their remarketing decisions.
Online Solutions
Our current online solutions include:

Marketplace Technology | Description 
ADESA Simulcast® / Simulcast+® | Our live digital bidding solution, ADESA Simulcast®, operates in our marketplaces, including in concert with our ADESA Canada marketplaces, and provides registered buyers with the opportunity to participate in live auction marketplace sales. Potential buyers bid online in real time along with the live local bidders and other online bidders via a simple, web-based interface. ADESA Simulcast® provides live real-time streaming audio and video from the physical location as well as still images of vehicles and other data. On-premise buyers can inspect and evaluate the vehicle while online buyers can review comprehensive vehicle detail and inspection data on our marketplaces. Simulcast+ is a fully digital marketplace technology that is operated remotely and facilitates sequential sales, virtual interaction between sellers and buyers, and audio and visual cues that simulate the on-premise bidding. In addition to being utilized in our marketplaces, the ADESA Simulcast and Simulcast+ technology is also sold and licensed to other auction providers.
ADESA.ca, ADESA.com, ADESA.eu, ADESA.co.uk, ADESA DealerBlock® and Openlane.com | These platforms provide for either a real-time or "bulletin-board" marketplace for consigned inventory. We also utilize these platforms to provide certain selling capabilities for our consignors that facilitate the sale of vehicles prior to their arrival at a vehicle logistics center. Marketplace sales can be either closed (restricted to certain eligible dealers) or open (available to all eligible dealers) and inventory feeds of vehicles are automated with many customers' systems as well as third party providers that are integrated with various dealer management systems. Oftentimes, the vehicles offered for sale prior to their arrival at a vehicle logistics center are "private-labeled" for the consignors. 
BacklotCars | This mobile app and web-based dealer-to-dealer wholesale platform is utilized in the United States and features a 24/7 "bid-ask" marketplace offering vehicles with comprehensive inspections performed by automobile mechanics. CARWAVE was integrated with BacklotCars in the fourth quarter of 2022, combining the best features and functionality of both marketplaces and provides buyers and sellers the choice of marketplace sale formats – the traditional BacklotCars bid-ask environment or a new, live sale format where buying dealers bid head-to-head for available inventory. 
TradeRev | This mobile app-based marketplace is utilized in Canada and facilitates 45-minute live-bidding sales between sellers and buyers. Dealers can sell and source inventory directly from their smartphone, tablet or desktop. TradeRev also offers comprehensive inspection and vehicle history information and provides dealers with additional data-driven vehicle recommendations and insights to help them make more informed buying and selling decisions. 

Competition
In the North American wholesale used vehicle industry, we compete with physical auction providers including Manheim and others. We also compete with several digital marketplace providers, including ACV Auctions and others. In addition, used car retailers, such as CarMax, have developed proprietary platforms for selling vehicles to other dealers. In the United States, competition is strongest with Manheim for the supply of used vehicles from national commercial customers. In Canada, we are the largest wholesale used vehicle marketplace operator. The supply of vehicles from dealers is dispersed among all of the marketplace and auction competitors in the used vehicle market.
The wholesale used vehicle industry is highly fragmented in Europe. Our digital marketplaces primarily compete with large European digital remarketers, including BCA Group and others. There are also a number of small independent auction operations throughout Europe. 
Finance
Overview
AFC is a leading provider of floorplan financing to independent used vehicle dealers. We provide short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, to independent used vehicle dealers through locations throughout North America. In 2022, AFC serviced approximately 1.6 million loan transactions, which includes both loans paid off and loans extended, or curtailed. We sell the majority of our U.S. dollar-denominated finance receivables without recourse to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which sells an undivided participation interest in such finance receivables to a group of bank purchasers on a revolving basis. We also securitize the majority of our Canadian dollar denominated finance receivables through a separate third-party facility. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from fees. These fees include origination, floorplan, curtailment and other related program fees. When the loan is extended or paid in full, AFC collects all accrued fees and interest.
In addition, AFC provides liquidity for customer trade-ins which encompasses settling lien holder payoff. We also provide title services for our customers. These services are provided through AFC's digital servicing network as well as its physical locations throughout North America. 
Customers and Locations
Floorplan financing primarily supports independent used vehicle dealers in North America who purchase vehicles on our marketplaces or those of our competitors and for non-auction purchases. In 2022, approximately 87% of the vehicles floorplanned by AFC were vehicles purchased by dealers on our marketplaces or through a competitor. Our ability to provide floorplan financing facilitates the growth of vehicle sales on our marketplaces. As of December 31, 2022, we serviced customers through approximately 100 locations in markets with a significant concentration of AFC customers. Geographic proximity to the customers gives our employees the ability to stay in close contact with outstanding accounts, thereby better enabling them to manage credit risk and build customer relationships.
As of December 31, 2022, AFC had approximately 12,400 active dealers with an average line of credit of approximately $370,000 and no one dealer representing greater than 1.1% of our portfolio. An average of approximately 15 vehicles per active dealer were floorplanned with an approximate average value outstanding of $13,500 per vehicle as of December 31, 2022.
Sales and Marketing
AFC approaches and seeks to expand its share of the independent dealer floorplan market through a number of methods and channels. We target and solicit new dealers through both direct sales efforts at the dealer's place of business as well as location-based sales and customer service representatives, who service our dealers at our vehicle logistics centers or competitors where they replenish and rotate vehicle inventory. These largely local efforts are handled by field personnel. AFC's corporate-level team and Business Development Center also provide sales and marketing support to AFC field personnel by helping to identify new dealer opportunities, generating new leads through digital channels, and coordinating promotional activity with our marketplace platforms, competitor auctions and other vehicle supply sources. AFC also relies on the utilization of actionable data to drive the business forward (predictive modeling from historical and real-time data). 
Credit
Our procedures, proprietary systems and data enable us to manage our credit risk by tracking each vehicle from origination to payoff, while expediting services through our field network. Typically, we assess a floorplan fee at the inception of a loan and we collect all accrued fees and interest when the loan is extended or repaid in full. In addition, AFC generally holds the title or other evidence of ownership to all vehicles which are floorplanned. Typical loan terms are 30 to 90 days, each with a possible loan extension. For an additional fee, this loan extension allows the dealer to extend the duration of the loan beyond the original term for another 30 to 90 days if the dealer makes payment towards principal and pays accrued fees and interest.
The extension of a credit line to a dealer starts with the underwriting process. Credit lines up to $600,000 are extended using a proprietary scoring model developed internally by AFC. Credit lines in excess of $600,000 may be extended using underwriting guidelines which generally require dealership and personal financial statements, monthly bank statements, sales reports and tax returns. The underwriting of each line of credit requires an analysis, write-up and recommendation by the credit department and, in case of credit lines in excess of $600,000, final review by a credit committee.
Collateral Management
Collateral management is an integral part of daily operations at each AFC location, including our corporate headquarters. AFC's proprietary system facilitates this daily collateral management by providing real-time access to dealer information and enables field and corporate personnel to assess and manage potential collection issues. Restrictions are automatically placed on customer accounts in the event of a delinquency, payments by dealers from bank accounts with insufficient funds or poor audit results. Field personnel are proactive in managing collateral by monitoring loans and notifying dealers that payments are coming due. In addition, approximately 60,000 routine audits, or inventory audits, are performed annually on the dealers' lots through our AutoVIN subsidiary. The audit reconciliation process is centralized in order to better mitigate risk and make field personnel time available to focus on the customer. Poor results from inventory audits typically require personnel to take actions to determine the status of missing collateral, including visiting the dealer personally, verifying units held off-site and collecting payments for units sold. Audits also identify troubled accounts, triggering the involvement of AFC's collections department.
AFC operates two divisions which are organized into ten regions in North America. Each division and region is monitored by managers who oversee daily operations. At the corporate level, AFC employs full-time collection specialists and collection attorneys who are assigned to specific regions and monitor collection activity for these areas. Collection specialists work closely with the field offices to track trends before an account becomes a troubled account and to determine, together with collection attorneys, the best strategy to secure the collateral once a troubled account is identified.
Securitization
AFC sells the majority of its U.S. dollar denominated finance receivables on a revolving basis and without recourse to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote, consolidated, special purpose subsidiary ("AFC Funding Corporation"), established for the purpose of purchasing AFC's finance receivables. A securitization agreement allows for the revolving sale by AFC Funding Corporation to a group of bank purchasers of undivided interests in certain finance receivables subject to committed liquidity. AFC's securitization facility has been in place since 1996. AFC Funding Corporation had a committed facility of $2.0 billion from a third-party facility for U.S. finance receivables at December 31, 2022. The agreement expires on January 31, 2026.
We also have an agreement in place for the securitization of Automotive Finance Canada Inc.'s ("AFCI") receivables. This securitization facility provides up to C$225 million in financing for eligible finance receivables through a third-party conduit (separate from the U.S. facility). The agreement expires on January 31, 2026. The receivables sold pursuant to both the U.S. and Canadian securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings.
Competition
AFC provides short-term dealer floorplan financing of wholesale vehicles primarily to independent vehicle dealers in North America. At the national level, AFC's competition includes NextGear Capital, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., other specialty lenders, banks and financial institutions. At the local level, AFC faces competition from banks, credit unions and independent auctions who may offer floorplan financing to local customers. Such entities typically service only one or a small number of auctions.
Some of our industry competitors who operate wholesale used vehicle marketplaces on a national scale may endeavor to capture a larger portion of the floorplan financing market. AFC competes primarily on a relationship basis, focusing on quality of service, convenience of payment, scope of services offered to solve customer pain points and consistent commitment to the sector. This and our long-term relationships with customers have been established over time and act as a competitive strength for us.
Seasonality
The volume of vehicles sold through our marketplaces generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, holidays and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the wholesale used vehicle industry. Used vehicle marketplace volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle marketplace volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.
In addition, changes in working capital vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of collections and disbursements of funds to consignors from marketplace sales held near period end. 
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications, provide certain disclosures and notices, limit interest rates, fees and other charges and protect personal data. Some examples of the regulations and laws that impact our company are included in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" under the risk: "We are subject to a complex framework of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, which have in the past, and could in the future, subject us to claims, challenge our business model, or otherwise harm our business." Changes in government regulations or interpretations of existing regulations could result in increased costs, reduced vehicle prices and decreased profitability for us. In addition, failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in existing regulations or in their interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to liability, damage our reputation and require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions.
Some of the facilities on which we operate are impacted by recognized environmental concerns and pollution conditions. We have incurred and may in the future incur expenditures relating to compliance and risk mitigation efforts, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant.
Employees and Human Capital
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,500 employees, of which approximately 2,100 were located in the U.S. and approximately 2,400 were located in Canada, Europe, Mexico, Uruguay and the Philippines. Approximately 88% of our workforce consists of full-time employees. None of our employees participate in collective bargaining agreements, but we have established a works council in Belgium pursuant to local law. In addition to the employee workforce, we utilize independent contractors and temporary labor services to provide certain services.
Our people drive our business, so we strive to attract, develop and retain high-performing talent. Led by our Chief People Officer, we have programs and practices in place to onboard, support and retain our talent, and to source new talent in a highly competitive environment. We recognize the importance of our workforce and the employee experience, and strive to offer competitive compensation and benefits while fostering a culture of open dialogue, inclusion and belonging. Additionally, we enable support functions and people managers that are dedicated to the growth and development of our teams.
