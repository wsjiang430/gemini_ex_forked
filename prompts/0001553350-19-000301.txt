GENERAL

History of our company

Our corporation was formed in Delaware in July 2015.

In January 2016, we acquired certain assets of LibertySniper.com, including email and subscriber list databases, email service provider contracts and dedicated IP addresses, editorial content, lead generation campaigns, pen name and voice of publisher Michael Westan, email tripwire campaigns and welcome series content, and all account access related to LibertySniper.com, including hosting, Google Analytics, Adwords and content management system license. Under the terms of the sales agreement, we paid the seller $50,000.
Overview

We are a provider of health and wellness information principally targeted to people who are prediabetes or who have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a condition characterized by high blood glucose levels caused by either a lack of insulin or the body's inability to use insulin efficiently. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults but can appear in children, teens, and young people. According to the American Diabetes Foundation, type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. While many people may need to take oral medications or insulin as prescribed by their physicians to help the person meet his or her targeted blood glucose levels, according to the American Diabetes Foundation some people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood glucose with healthy eating and being active. We do not offer products targeted to customers with type 1 diabetes, nor do we render medical advice. We provide information to our customers who are seeking to make healthy choices by providing clear, generic blueprints, education, resources, and support. Our core product is our proprietary Lifestyle Blueprint, a digital guide that provides dietary recommendations for a very low calorie eight-week diet together with information focusing on what, how and how much a person eats, nutritional information and how a persons body does and does not use food to enable our customers to continue leading a more successful lifestyle. We also offer nutritional supplements and monthly subscriptions to our proprietary newsletter which covers a wide variety of healthy living-related topics.

Our informational content, which is developed by our company based upon publicly available studies and other sources of information, is rooted in:


· | Education and Action. Our goal is to help our audience understand the root of a healthy lifestyle, and give action-based blueprints that provide a long-term commitment to their newfound education; 
· | Easy. Each aspect of our behavior change protocols is simple and reasonably attainable; 
· | Avoid Guesswork. We give clear path guides to help real people, without confusion. In an information-overload world, we seek to do all of the groundwork in order to give our audience the right data and resources they need to succeed; and

We do not provide medical advice to our customers.

Markets for Lifestyle Blueprints

Our model is highly scalable and we believe that we can enter new markets at a low cost and measured way. We expect to expand our product offerings in the future to include a Lifestyle Blueprint designed for adults who are overweight or obese. We also intend, over time, to expand our product offerings with additional Lifestyle Blueprints targeted to individuals with cardiovascular disease, memory loss and dementia, addiction, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and the human papillomavirus virus (HPV). We have not, however, determine when we will be expanding our product offerings and there are no assurances we will ever do so.

Marketing and sales

We sell products on our websites at www.constitutionalhealth.com and www.dwdprotocol.com. We utilize digital media, primarily paid search, paid social, affiliate marketing and display advertising to drive traffic to our web site. We also use social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter, and various blogs. In 2018 and 2017 we spent $866,865 and $1,366,064, respectively, on advertising. 

We seek to market our products using direct to consumer online sales through multiple channels. Social media, search engines, and content platforms, principally Facebook, as well as Instagram, Google, and YouTube, have historically been our principal sources for acquiring new customers. In the case of paid advertising, we use both internal (managed by us) and external (managed through affiliates or partner advertisers) advertising accounts.

For internal accounts, we directly spend and manage all advertising dollars spent on a cost per click, or CPC, basis. Typically, we will spend approximately $60.00 on internal account advertising for each new customer. In the case of external accounts, we will work through third party affiliates or partner advertisers. These affiliate or partner advertisers typically use our product materials on their advertising accounts, spend their own advertising dollars, and are paid by us on a cost per acquisition, or CPA, basis. Historically our payments to these affiliate or partner advertisers on a CPA basis has been tied to a new customer sales. Depending on the products sold, the CPA payout can range from $30.00 to $80.00 for a new customer sale. This range, however, may change at any time, depending on the cost of revenue, and/or lifetime customer value we believe the campaign can achieve.

We also use email advertising as a source of new customer generation. In the case of email advertising, we will pay for our advertisement link (picture or text) to be sent to a third party publishers email list. We send our internally created advertisements to the third party publisher with a unique tracking link embedded, and the third party publisher manages the entire emailing process. We embed the unique tracking link to assist us to evaluate the sales performance from each email list. Utilizing this process, we neither participate in the transmission of the actual emails nor do we have access to the potential customer's email.

We also utilize email lead generation to attract potential new customers. In this scenario, we may spend advertising dollars on a campaign that acquires new customer email leads. These leads typically review free articles or content online that we publish, and offer the opportunity for the reader to join our emailing list to receive more information. 

In the case of each of our advertising campaigns, since our campaigns historically have been digitally driven, we use various forms of multimedia, including video, audio, and imagery. Depending on the platform and placement (mobile/tablet/desktop), the advertising content will vary. For example, in the case of Facebook, we will use video with audio to present the product in a detailed and explanatory way. We recognize that our product is not generally known, and typically our customers must be educated on what the product does prior to acquiring a purchase from them.

Our Lifestyle Blueprint is digitally delivered by us. We have engaged Argo Marketing Group, Inc. to provide customer relations services for us in connection with sales of our products. Under the terms of the agreement entered into in November 2015, Argo Marketing Group, Inc. is responsible for all customer service call handling, email management, and chargeback management. We agreed to pay the company various initial and additional set up fees, customer services fees tiered to the weekly minutes, per transaction fees for email resolutions or return processing and chargeback management, among other fees. The initial term of the agreement was for one year, with automatic one-year renewals unless either party provides a 30 day written notice of non-renewal. The agreement may be terminated by Argo Marketing Group, Inc. for non-payment, in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency and by either party upon a breach or without cause. Mr. Mannine, our chief executive officer, has personally guaranteed our obligations under this agreement.

We do not manufacture the private label nutritional supplements we sell. These nutritional supplements are manufactured on a per order basis for us by Food Science® Corporation, a 40- year old Vermont-based family-owned company focused on nutritional research and product development. We utilize the services of a third-party fulfillment company to ship the nutritional supplements to our customers, and pay this provider an order and per item fee.

We believe our relationships with our supplement supplier and the third party providers we utilize for fulfillment and customer service are good. However, while we believe we can replace the third party providers for fulfillment and customer service with comparable companies at similar costs to us, a disruption in the relationship with our supplement supplier would materially impact our business until such time as we were able to establish a relationship with an alternative supplier.

Competitors

We seek to compete with a number of larger, more established companies that provide health and wellness content and market nutritional supplements, including Nutrisystem, Inc. (NasdaqGS: NTRI), Medifast, Inc. (NYSE: MED) and Weight Watchers International, Inc. (NYSE: WTW), as well as privately held Virta Health Corp. and television and media personality Dr. Axe. In addition, while we do not offer products targeted to customers with type 1 diabetes, some of our competitors target customers with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All of these potential competitors have greater brand awareness and financial resources that we do. While we are seeking to compete by focusing on our niche proprietary content, we do not presently have the financial resources available to us to effectively market our company on a large scale or to develop new products to quickly respond to a marketplace dominated by well established, well capitalized companies. There are no assurances we will ever establish brand recognition at a sufficient level to permit us to generate any significant revenues or to effectively compete in our market.
Information Systems

Our ecommerce and websites and our tools and trackers, all of which are based primarily on third-party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in top tier hosting facilities. These facilities provide redundant network connections, physical and fire security and generator power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely and are intended to provide an uninterruptible power supply. Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data. When our customers place an order or access their account information, we secure that transaction by using encryption technologies, including transport layer security, or TLS. Our customer data is protected against unauthorized access by security measures and we engage a variety of industry leading technology providers including VeriSign, CyberSource, and SecureWorks to further ensure the security of our credit card transactions and the safety of our customers personal information.

Intellectual property

We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of our proprietary rights as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We utilized the unregistered brand name Constitutional Health in our business. We have been granted a limited non-transferrable, royalty-free license by NatureX Inc. to utilize the trademark Glucevia® for so long as we continue to acquire its faxinus excelsior seed extract which is a component of our DWD nutritional supplements.

We also own the domain names www.vynleads.com, wearedwd.com, dwdprotocol.com, codexone.org, and www.constitutionalhealth.com, together with a number of additional domain names which we may use in future periods. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is also subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.

Government regulation

Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation. Certain federal and state agencies, such as the FTC, regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing, and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters. A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity and restrictions on our business operations. The FTC has in the past instituted enforcement actions against dietary supplement and food companies for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. There are no assurances that the FTC will not question our advertising claims in the future. An enforcement action brought by a government agency, like the FTC in the United States, or a class action lawsuit, could adversely affect our reputation and potentially result in significant penalties and costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation. For example, the manufacturing, labeling, and distribution of food products, including nutritional supplements, are subject to strict United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, and United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters. We rely on our supplement supplier to follow all applicable government regulation. If our supplement supplier should fail to conform to all applicable regulations, or if federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to modify or discontinue our supplement offerings which could harm our operating results. Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial. 

Aspects of our industry are also subject to state regulations. In 1986, California passed The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, which is commonly known as Proposition 65. This proposition seeks to prevent businesses from exposing consumers to certain toxins, including lead, arsenic, and PCBs, without providing a warning. Because Proposition 65 did not set a safe harbor limit for reproductive health and PCBs, all products containing even trace amounts of PCBs require a specific warning label. In addition, for any food or nutritional supplements containing over 0.09 micrograms per day of PCBs, the state-mandated warning label is expanded to include an additional cancer warning. While at this time, the supplements we marked and sell do not contain the ingredients to require Proposition 65 disclosure, it is possible in the future other supplements we may market and sell will require the warning labels. It is also possible at additional states will also enact legislation which could require us to change the type of nutritional supplements or other products we market, or discontinue offering certain products and services if the estimated cost of compliance outweighs the potential revenues.

Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel, and taxation, are becoming more prevalent and some remain unsettled. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected. Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.

Employees

At April 1, 2019, we had one employee including our chief executive officer.

Properties

We rent executive office space on a month to month basis under a co-working agreement with an unrelated third party at a monthly fee of $200.
