Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for use in medically supervised settings. DSUVIA™ (known as DZUVEO in Europe) and Zalviso, are both focused on the treatment of acute pain, and each utilize sufentanil, delivered via a non-invasive route of sublingual administration, exclusively for use in medically supervised settings. On November 2, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our resubmitted NDA for DSUVIA for use in adults in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, such as hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments, for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. In June 2018, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing approval of DZUVEO for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically monitored settings. We are developing a distribution capability and commercial organization to market and sell DSUVIA in the United States. The commercial launch of DSUVIA in the United States occurred in the first quarter of 2019. In geographies where we decide not to commercialize ourselves, including for DZUVEO in Europe, we may seek to out-license commercialization rights. We currently intend to commercialize and promote DSUVIA/DZUVEO outside the United States with one or more strategic partners, although we have not yet entered into any such arrangement. We are currently evaluating the timing of the resubmission of the NDA for Zalviso. If we are successful in obtaining approval of Zalviso in the United States, we plan to potentially promote Zalviso either by ourselves or with strategic partners. Zalviso is approved in Europe and is currently being commercialized by Grünenthal GmbH, or Grünenthal.

We have chosen sufentanil as the therapeutic ingredient for DSUVIA and Zalviso. Opioids have been utilized for pain relief for centuries and are the standard-of-care for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. Sufentanil, a high-therapeutic index opioid, which has no active metabolites, is available as an injectable in several markets around the world and is used by anesthesiologists for induction of sedation or as an epidural; however, the injectable formulation is not suitable for the treatment of acute pain. Sufentanil has many pharmacological advantages over other opioids. Published studies demonstrate that sufentanil produces significantly less respiratory depressive effects relative to its analgesic effects compared to other opioids, including morphine and fentanyl. These third-party clinical results correlate well with preclinical trials demonstrating sufentanil’s high therapeutic index, or the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic dose of a drug, used as a measure of the relative safety of the drug for a particular treatment. Accordingly, we believe that sufentanil can provide an effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute pain. The following table illustrates the difference between the therapeutic index of different opioids. 
 

Opioid | Therapeutic Index 
--------------+---------------------
Meperidine | 5 
Methadone | 12 
Morphine | 71 
Hydromorphone | 250 
Fentanyl | 277 
Sufentanil | 26,716 

 
In addition, the pharmaceutical attributes of sufentanil, including lipid solubility and ionization, result in rapid cell membrane penetration and onset of action, which we believe make sufentanil an optimal opioid for the treatment of acute pain.
 
Although the analgesic efficacy and safety of sufentanil have been well established, the product’s use has been historically limited due to its short duration of action when delivered intravenously. Sublingual delivery of sufentanil avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action of intravenous, or IV, administration.
 
We have created a proprietary sublingual (under the tongue) formulation of sufentanil intended for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. We believe our non-invasive, proprietary sublingual sufentanil tablet potentially overcomes many of the limitations of current treatment options available for moderate-to-severe acute pain. The sublingual formulation retains the therapeutic value of sufentanil, and novel delivery devices provide a non-invasive route of administration. Sufentanil is highly lipophilic which provides for rapid absorption in the mucosal tissue, or fatty cells, found under the tongue, and for rapid transit across the blood-brain barrier to reach the mu-opioid receptors in the brain. The sublingual route of delivery used by DSUVIA and Zalviso provides a predictable onset of analgesia. The sublingual delivery system also eliminates the risk of intravenous, or IV, complications, such as catheter-related infections. In addition, because patients do not require direct connection to an IV infusion pump, or IV line, DSUVIA and Zalviso may allow for ease of patient mobility.

DSUVIA™ (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg)
 
DSUVIA, known as DZUVEO in Europe, approved by the FDA in November 2018, is indicated for use in adults in a certified medically supervised healthcare setting, such as hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments, for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. DSUVIA was designed to provide rapid analgesia via a non-invasive route and to eliminate dosing errors associated with IV administration. DSUVIA is a single-strength solid dosage form administered sublingually via a single-dose applicator, or SDA, by healthcare professionals. Sufentanil is an opioid analgesic currently marketed for intravenous, or IV, and epidural anesthesia and analgesia. The sufentanil pharmacokinetic profile when delivered sublingually avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action observed with IV administration. The European Commission, or EC, approved DZUVEO for marketing in Europe in June 2018.
 
DSUVIA was approved with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which restricts distribution to certified medically supervised healthcare settings in order to prevent respiratory depression resulting from accidental exposure. DSUVIA will only be distributed to facilities certified in the DSUVIA REMS program following attestation by an authorized representative to comply with appropriate dispensing and use restrictions of DSUVIA. To become certified, a healthcare setting will need to train their healthcare professionals on the proper use of DSUVIA and have the ability to manage respiratory depression. DSUVIA will not be available in retail pharmacies or for outpatient use. As part of the REMS program, we will monitor distribution and audit wholesalers’ data, evaluate proper usage within the healthcare settings and monitor for any diversion and abuse. Additionally, we will de-certify healthcare settings that are non-compliant with the REMS program.
 
Examples of potential patient populations and settings in which DSUVIA could be used include: emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; certain types of office-based or hospital-based procedures; patients being treated and transported by paramedics; and for battlefield casualties. In the emergency room and in ambulatory care environments, patients often do not have immediate IV access available, or maintaining IV access may provide an impediment to rapid discharge. Moreover, IV dosing results in high peak plasma levels, thereby limiting the opioid dose and requiring frequent redosing intervals to titrate to satisfactory analgesia. Oral pills and liquids generally have slow and erratic onset of analgesia. Based on internal market research conducted to date, we believe that additional treatment options are needed that can safely and effectively treat acute trauma pain, in both civilian and military settings, and that can provide an alternative to currently marketed oral pills and liquids, as well as IV-administered opioids, for moderate-to-severe acute pain.
 
Zalviso® (sufentanil sublingual tablet system, 15 mcg) 
 
Zalviso is intended for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in hospitalized adult patients. Zalviso consists of a pre-filled cartridge of 40 sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, delivered by the Zalviso System, a needle-free, handheld, patient-administered, pain management system. While still under development in the U.S., as discussed further below, Zalviso is approved and marketed in the EU.
 
Zalviso is a pre-programmed non-invasive system to allow hospital patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain to self-dose with sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, to manage their pain. Zalviso is designed to help address certain problems associated with post-operative IV patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA. Zalviso allows patients to self-administer sufentanil sublingual tablets via a pre-programmed, secure system designed in part to eliminate the risk of healthcare provider programming errors.
 
The potential benefits of Zalviso are the result of combining the following three elements:
 

• | sufentanil, a high therapeutic index opioid;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | sufentanil sublingual tablets, our proprietary, non-invasive sublingual dosage form; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our novel, pre-programmed, handheld PCA device that enables simple patient-controlled delivery of sufentanil sublingual tablets in the hospital setting and eliminates the risk of programming errors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Zalviso allows patients to self-administer sufentanil sublingual tablets as needed to manage their moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting and provides the record-keeping attributes of a conventional IV PCA pump while avoiding some of the key issues, such as programming errors, associated with conventional IV PCA use.
 
The Zalviso System consists of the following components: a disposable dispenser tip, a disposable dispenser cap, an adhesive thumb tag, a cartridge of 40 sufentanil sublingual 15 mcg tablets (approximately a two-day supply) in a disposable radio frequency identification and bar-coded cartridge, a reusable, rechargeable handheld controller, a tether, and an authorized access card.

Drugs are classified or scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, according to their potential for abuse and addiction. Sufentanil is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance. Scheduled drugs, when they are under patient control in a hospital setting, must be secured and have adequate dose access control and tracking mechanisms. Our novel handheld PCA device has the following safety features:
 

• | an authorized access card, which is a wireless system access key for the healthcare professional;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a wireless, electronic, adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single-patient identification key;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-programmed 20-minute lock-out to avoid overdosing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | tablet singulation, or dispensing, motion that eliminates runaway motor delivery risk;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a security tether that is designed to prevent theft and misuse; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fully automated inventory record of sufentanil sublingual tablet usage.

On December 16, 2013, AcelRx and Grünenthal GmbH, or Grünenthal, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, and related Manufacture and Supply Agreement, or the MSA, and together with the License Agreement, the Agreements, as amended July 17, 2015 and September 20, 2016, or the Amended Agreements. The License Agreement grants Grünenthal rights to commercialize Zalviso, our novel sublingual PCA system, or the Product, in the countries of the EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway and Australia, or the Territory, for human use in pain treatment within, or dispensed by, hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and other medically supervised settings, or the Field. We retain rights with respect to the Product in countries outside the Territory, including the United States, Asia and Latin America. Under the MSA, we will exclusively manufacture and supply the Product to Grünenthal for the Field in the Territory. Grünenthal shall purchase from us, during the first five years after the effective date of the MSA, 100% and thereafter 80% of Grünenthal’s and its sublicensees’ and distributors’ requirements of Product for use in the Field for the Territory. For additional information on the Amended Agreements, see Note 7 “Collaboration Agreement” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Zalviso was approved for commercial sale by the EC in September 2015 and Grünenthal began its commercial launch of Zalviso in the European Union in April 2016. On September 18, 2015, we sold a majority of the expected royalty stream and commercial milestones from the sales of Zalviso in Europe by Grünenthal to PDL, which we refer to in this report as the Royalty Monetization. For additional information on the Royalty Monetization with PDL, see Note 9 “Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Royalty revenues and non-cash royalty revenues from the commercial sales of Zalviso in the EU are expected to be minimal for 2019.
 
We submitted an NDA for Zalviso in September 2013, or Zalviso NDA, and on July 25, 2014, the Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for the Zalviso NDA. The CRL contained requests for additional information on the Zalviso System to ensure proper use of the device. The requests include submission of data demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of device errors, changes to address inadvertent dosing, among other items, and submission of additional data to support the shelf life of the product. In March 2015, we received correspondence from the FDA stating that, in addition to the work we had performed to address the items in the CRL, a clinical study would be required to test the modifications to the Zalviso device and mitigations put in place to reduce the risk of inadvertent dosing/misplaced tablets.
 
Our IAP312 study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of changes made to the functionality and usability of the Zalviso device and to take into account comments from the FDA on the study protocol. In the IAP312 study, 320 hospitalized, post-operative patients used Zalviso to self-administer 15 mcg sublingual sufentanil tablets as often as once every 20 minutes for 24-to-72 hours to manage their moderate-to-severe acute pain. Throughout the study, for which top-line results were announced in August 2017, 2.2% of patients experienced a Zalviso device error, which was statistically less than the 5% limit specified in the study objectives. None of these device errors resulted in an over-dosing event. This 2.2% rate was lower (p < 0.001) than the 7.9% rate of device errors during patient use previously reported for the earlier version of the Zalviso device in the Phase 3 IAP311 study. In addition, results of this study supported earlier clinical findings, with favorable tolerability and a significant majority of “good” or “excellent” ratings provided by both patients and healthcare providers when assessing the method of pain control. We intend to submit these results, together with our earlier Phase 3 studies (IAP309, IAP310 and IAP311), all of which met safety and efficacy endpoints, as part of our resubmission of the NDA for Zalviso.

Clinical Trials
 
Active comparator trial (IAP309) 
 
In November 2012, we reported top-line data showing that Zalviso had met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in the Phase 3 open-label active comparator trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso (15 mcg/dose) to IV PCA with morphine (1mg/dose) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute post-operative pain. Utilizing a randomized, open-label, parallel group design, this trial enrolled 359 adult patients at 26 U.S. sites for the treatment of pain immediately following open-abdominal or major orthopedic surgery (hip and knee replacement). Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with Zalviso or IV PCA morphine and were treated for a minimum of 48 hours and up to 72 hours.
 
Double-blind, placebo-controlled, abdominal surgery trial (IAP310) 
 
In March 2013, we reported top-line data results demonstrating that Zalviso met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso to placebo in the management of acute post-operative pain after major open abdominal surgery. Adverse events reported in the trial were generally mild or moderate in nature and similar in both placebo and treatment groups. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this Phase 3 trial enrolled 178 adult patients at 13 U.S. sites. Patients were treated for post-operative pain for a minimum of 48 hours, and up to 72 hours. Patients were randomized 2:1, with 119 patients randomized to sufentanil sublingual tablet treatment and 59 to placebo treatment. Both treatments were delivered by the patient, as needed, using Zalviso with a 20-minute lock-out period. Patients in both groups could receive up to 2 mg morphine intravenously per hour as a rescue medication, the primary purpose of this rescue medication being to provide placebo-treated patients access to pain medication to enable them to stay in the trial as long as possible. Pre-rescue pain scores were imputed to minimize the impact of this rescue opioid on efficacy evaluations.
 
The primary endpoint evaluated pain intensity over the 48-hour study period compared to baseline, or Summed Pain Intensity Difference, or SPID-48, in patients following major open abdominal surgery. Patients receiving sufentanil sublingual tablets demonstrated a significantly greater SPID-48 compared to placebo-treated patients during the study period (105.6 and 55.6, respectively; p=0.001).
 
Double-blind, placebo-controlled, orthopedic surgery trial (IAP311) 
 
In May 2013, we reported top-line data results demonstrating that Zalviso met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso to placebo in the management of acute post-operative pain after major orthopedic surgery. Adverse events reported in the study were generally mild or moderate in nature and were similar in both placebo and treatment groups for the majority of adverse events. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this pivotal Phase 3 study enrolled 426 adult patients at 34 U.S. sites for treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain immediately following major orthopedic surgery. Seven patients did not receive study drug, resulting in 419 patients being included in the ITT population. Patients were treated for a minimum of 48 hours, and up to 72 hours. Patients were randomized 3:1, with 323 patients randomized to sufentanil sublingual tablet treatment and 104 to placebo treatment. Both treatments were delivered by the patient, as needed, using the Zalviso System with a 20-minute lock-out period. Patients in both groups could receive up to 2 mg morphine intravenously per hour as a rescue medication, the primary purpose of this rescue medication being to enable placebo-treated patients to stay in the study. Pain scores recorded just prior to the delivery of rescue medication were gathered and imputed forward to minimize the impact of this rescue opioid on efficacy evaluations.
 
The primary endpoint evaluated SPID-48 in patients following major orthopedic surgery. Patients receiving Zalviso demonstrated a significantly greater SPID-48 compared to placebo-treated patients during the study period (+76.1 and -11.5, respectively; p < 0.001). Two hundred fifteen (68.3%) sufentanil sublingual tablet-treated patients completed the 48-hour study period, compared to 43 (41.3%) placebo-treated patients. Primary reasons for drop-out in the sufentanil sublingual tablet- and placebo-treated groups were adverse events (7.0% and 6.7%, respectively) and lack of efficacy (14.3% and 48.1%, respectively).
 
Two patients (one each in the sufentanil sublingual tablet group and placebo group) experienced a serious adverse event considered possibly or probably related to the study drug by the investigator.
 
Combined related adverse events for the two placebo-controlled pivotal studies (IAP310 and IAP311) compared to placebo are shown below. Only pruritus (itching) was statistically different for Zalviso compared to placebo (p = 0.002).

3 patients (0.7%) in the Zalviso group had treatment-emergent respiratory events that required naloxone reversal.
 
Multi-center, single-arm, open-label study (IAP312)
 
IAP312 was a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the overall performance of the Zalviso System, in response to the CRL received from the FDA for Zalviso. Throughout the study in 320 enrolled patients, 2.2% of patients experienced a Zalviso device error, which was statistically less than the 5% limit specified in the study objectives. Importantly, none of these device errors resulted in an over-dosing event. This 2.2% rate was lower (p < 0.001) than the 7.9% rate of device errors during patient use previously reported for the earlier version of the Zalviso device in the Phase 3 IAP311 study.
 
In addition, as requested by FDA, the IAP312 study prospectively evaluated the number of inadvertently misplaced tablets which occurred during patient dosing. A small number of inadvertently misplaced tablets (less than 0.1% of total dispensed tablets) was observed in the original Phase 3 studies. However, the presence of inadvertently misplaced tablets had not been routinely assessed as part of the previous protocols. Throughout the IAP312 study, patients self-administered a total of 7,293 sufentanil tablets. Per the updated Zalviso training instructions electronically displayed on the hand-held device, 6 patients called the nurse when they failed to properly self-administer a single tablet to allow for proper retrieval and disposal of the tablet. Also, during inspection by the nurse, which occurred every two hours per protocol, a total of 7 misplaced tablets (<0.1% of total dispensed tablets) were discovered with 6 additional patients. No patient had a repeat incidence of an inadvertently misplaced tablet following re-training on the device. This combination of patient training and nurse inspection, along with the tracking features of the Zalviso device, could potentially address the FDA's concerns regarding drug accountability.
 
Finally, in this study, 86%, 89% and 100% of patients at the 24, 48 and 72-hour time points, respectively, recorded "good" or "excellent" ratings on the patient global assessment, or PGA, of the method of pain control, which measures a patient's satisfaction with their quality of analgesia. Healthcare professional global assessment, or HPGA, of the method of pain control was similarly strong, with 91%, 95% and 100% of nurses rating Zalviso as "good" or "excellent" over each respective 24-hour period. Zalviso was shown to be well tolerated by study participants, with nausea, hypotension and vomiting representing the most commonly reported adverse events. A total of 5 patients experienced serious adverse events, but all were considered unrelated to study drug by investigators.
 
The Market Opportunity for DSUVIA and Zalviso
 
Unmet Medical Need
 Settings in which patients might require the short-term management of moderate-to-severe acute pain include emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term patient-controlled analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; certain types of office-based procedures; patients being treated and transported by paramedics; and for battlefield casualties.

While IV opioids are currently employed to control moderate-to-severe acute pain in many of these settings, the use of IV opioids suffers from the following:
 

• | infection risk associated with the invasive nature of IV delivery;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consumption of hospital resources including an IV pump, a bed where the patient can be monitored, and nurse time; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | possible impairment of a patient’s cognitive abilities, which can make it difficult to provide accurate medical history to physicians during evaluation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe healthcare providers and hospital administrators caring for patients in moderate-to-severe acute pain in the aforementioned medically supervised settings could significantly benefit from the following items:
 

• | non-invasively delivered analgesic that utilizes fewer hospital resources, thereby incurring less cost;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effective and rapid-acting pain relief with sufficient duration of effect allowing efficient treatment while assuring patient satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pain relief that does not sacrifice cognitive function; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | infection risks due to invasive routes of delivery, such as IV.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
In our clinical studies, sublingual sufentanil has demonstrated the following attributes:
 

• | ease of administration;
--+------------------------


• | pain reduction (as much as 3-points on a validated 10-point scale) beginning as early as 15-to-30 minutes after administration;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintenance of cognitive function;
--+-----------------------------------


• | adverse event types similar to IV opioids, such as nausea, headache, vomiting and dizziness; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
•     lower percentage of patients with decreased oxygen saturation events compared to IV-PCA morphine.     
 
We believe that sublingual sufentanil provides a safety, efficacy and tolerability profile enabling our products to potentially replace IV opioid use in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain in the proposed medically-supervised settings. This may be especially true for DSUVIA in the emergency medical settings in the United States, where the number of emergency departments is decreasing, resulting in an increased focus on resource management to treat a growing number of patients in an efficient manner.
 
United States Market
 Based on commissioned research conducted in 2016, we estimate that there are over 90 million patients who are treated in various medically supervised settings for their moderate-to-severe acute pain which is significant enough to warrant the use of an opioid. We believe these patients may be eligible for treatment with DSUVIA, and in some cases Zalviso, if approved in the United States. The target patient population for DSUVIA are those patients in a certified medically supervised healthcare setting, such as hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments, for less than 24 hours. The target patient population for Zalviso are patients in a hospital setting for greater than 24 hours. Our current estimate of patients in moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings, by setting, is as follows:

Emergency services (includes pre-hospital and Emergency Department treatment) | 52 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
Outpatient surgery | 11 million
Hospital/surgery center/office-based procedures | 20 million
Inpatient surgery/inpatient conditions | 10 million

 
The market for Zalviso, given the target patients in a hospital setting for greater than 24 hours, is the approximately 10 million inpatient surgeries and inpatient conditions above. There can be no assurance that our estimates regarding the number of patients treated in the various settings will be accurate.
 
European Market
 According to recent EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) national health statistics, 142 million patients are represented across the DZUVEO target segments annually. Each year, there are an estimated 110 million emergency attendances and 32 million surgical procedures performed each year. It is anticipated that there are 51 million patients in emergency medicine with moderate-to-severe acute pain and 16 million with moderate-to-severe acute pain following surgery each year.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | seek commercial partnerships for DSUVIA/DZUVEO in countries outside of the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zalviso
Our specific strategy with respect to Zalviso is to:
 

• | continue to collaborate with Grünenthal to support commercial sales of Zalviso in their licensed territories;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complete our transition of the Zalviso contract manufacturing to one supplier; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | resubmit the Zalviso NDA to seek regulatory approval in the United States and, if successful, promote Zalviso as a follow-on product to DSUVIA or potentially seek a commercial partnership.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are currently evaluating the timing of the resubmission of the NDA for Zalviso.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We have established and will continue developing our distribution capability and commercial organization in the United States to market and sell DSUVIA in the United States. In geographies where we decide not to commercialize ourselves, we will seek to out-license commercialization rights.
 
We are building commercial capability in the United States progressively to support the launch of DSUVIA in the United States market. We foresee two stages of commercial execution to support successful introduction of DSUVIA in the United States:
 
To date, we have:
 

• | created and deployed a focused scientific support team to gather a detailed understanding of individual emergency room and hospital needs in order to present DSUVIA effectively;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased awareness of the clinical profile of sublingual administration of sufentanil through publication of our clinical data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engaged appropriate Advisory Boards that include representative emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, pharmacy and therapeutics, or P&T, committee members and other related experts to provide us with input on appropriate commercial positioning for DSUVIA for each of these key audiences;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | built a sales and marketing organization that can define appropriate segmentation and positioning strategies and tactics for DSUVIA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | gathered relevant clinical and health economic data identifying the limitations of IV opioids and other relevant treatments for moderate-to-severe acute pain in use today.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Next, we are expanding our commercialization plan through:
 

• | establishing DSUVIA on hospital and ambulatory surgery center formularies through deployment of an experienced team to explain the clinical and health economic attributes of DSUVIA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | building and progressively deploying a high-quality, customer-focused and experienced sales organization dedicated to bringing innovative, highly valued healthcare solutions to patients, payers and healthcare providers, including progressively building a targeted sales force of approximately 60 people in the United States;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potentially expanding the label to include pediatric populations by conducting post-approval clinical trials for DSUVIA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishing DSUVIA as a suitable choice for moderate-to-severe acute pain in certified medically supervised settings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaborative Arrangements 
 
Grünenthal Collaboration 
 
On December 16, 2013, and as amended July 17, 2015 and September 20, 2016, we and Grünenthal entered into the Amended Agreements. Under the terms of the Amended Agreements with Grünenthal, we received an upfront cash payment of $30.0 million in December 2013, a milestone payment of $5.0 million related to the MAA submission, which occurred in July 2014, and a $15.0 million milestone payment due to the EC approval of the MAA for Zalviso in September 2015. Under the Amended Agreements, we are eligible to receive approximately $194.5 million in additional milestone payments, based upon successful regulatory and product development efforts ($28.5 million) and net sales target achievements ($166.0 million). Grünenthal will also make tiered royalty, supply and trademark fee payments in the mid-teens up to the mid-twenties percent range, depending on the sales level achieved, on net sales of Zalviso in the Territory. For additional information on the Amended Agreements, see Note 7 “Collaboration Agreement” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
On September 18, 2015, we sold a majority of the expected royalty stream and commercial milestones from the sales of Zalviso in Europe by Grünenthal to PDL, or the Royalty Monetization. We received gross proceeds of $65.0 million in the Royalty Monetization. PDL will receive 75% of the European royalties under the Amended Agreements with Grünenthal, as well as 80% of the first four commercial milestones worth $35.6 million (or 80% of $44.5 million), subject to the capped amount of $195.0 million. For additional information on the Royalty Monetization with PDL, see Note 9 “Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Grünenthal is responsible for all commercial activities for Zalviso, including obtaining and maintaining pharmaceutical product regulatory approval in the Territory. We are responsible for obtaining and maintaining device regulatory approval in the Territory and manufacturing and supply of Zalviso to Grünenthal for commercial sales.
 
Intellectual Property

We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for DSUVIA and Zalviso. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights developed internally and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. We also rely on trade secrets to protect DSUVIA and Zalviso. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
 
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
 

• | obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for DSUVIA and Zalviso;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | defend our patents;
--+--------------------


• | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have established and continue to build proprietary positions for DSUVIA and Zalviso and related technology in the United States and abroad.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we are the owner of record of 22 issued U.S. patents, which together provide coverage for sufentanil sublingual tablets, and the device components of Zalviso and the DSUVIA. These patents provide coverage through at least 2027. We also hold six issued European patents, each valid in at least eight countries in Europe. In addition, we own seven patents in Japan, seven in China and seven in Korea, and a number of other international patents which provide coverage through at least 2027. We are also pursuing a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications. The patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents.
 
 12



We continue to seek and expand our patent protection for both compositions of matter and delivery devices, as well as methods of treatment related to DSUVIA and Zalviso. In particular, we are pursuing additional patent protection for our DSUVIA and Zalviso formulations, our Zalviso device, the combination of drugs and our Zalviso device, our DSUVIA SDA, as well as to methods of treatment using such drug and device compositions.
 
We have filed for additional patent coverage in the United States, Europe as well as many other foreign jurisdictions including, Japan, China, India, Canada and Korea. If issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, we expect that these patents will expire between 2027 and 2031, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions in the United States. We note that the patent laws of foreign countries differ from those in United States, and the degree of protection afforded by foreign patents may be different from the protection offered by U.S. patents.
 
Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have registered our ACELRX mark in Class 5, “Pharmaceutical preparations for treating pain; pharmaceutical preparations for treating anxiety,” and Class 10, “Drug delivery systems; medical device, namely, a mechanical and electronic device used to administer medications, perform timed medication delivery, and to provide secure access to and delivery of medications,” in the United States.
 
Our ACELRX mark is also registered in the European Community, Canada, and India.
 
Competition 
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our products are the safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, the patient and healthcare professional satisfaction with using our products in relation to available alternatives and the reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement of our products. Over the past year, we have monitored changes in the pharmaceutical industry in response to opioid use in the United States. Pharmaceutical companies engaged in the distribution and sale of opioids, in particular for the treatment of chronic pain, are refocusing their efforts in order to support responsible opioid use. While our products are designed for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain for use in medically supervised settings, rather than for the treatment of chronic pain or for outpatient use, these industry changes could impact the commercial success of DSUVIA, or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States.
 
Potential Competition for DSUVIA

There are a wide variety of approved injectable and oral opioid products to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain, including IV opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone and meperidine or oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone. DSUVIA does not require placement of an IV line and therefore direct competitors in the emergency department are other non-invasive, rapid-acting analgesics. In this environment, DSUVIA may compete with Egalet Corporation’s SPRIX (intranasal ketorolac) or products that are in development, such as INSYS’ sublingual buprenorphine spray. Transmucosal fentanyl products, such as ACTIQ or FENTORA (Cephalon, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Products Ltd.), are approved for opioid-tolerant patients suffering from cancer pain and are contraindicated for the management of acute or post-operative pain and therefore are not a competitor for DSUVIA. Orally administered tablets or liquids containing oxycodone or hydrocodone often have slower absorption and slower analgesic onset than transmucosal opioids. Examples of oral opioids include Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s OXAYDO (marketed by Egalet Corporation), Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s NUCYNTA, and Purdue Pharma, L.P.’s OXYFAST, or generic oral opioids which have moderate-to-severe acute pain labeling.
 
Often used in combination with opioids are generic injectable local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, or branded formulations thereof, including Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s EXPAREL. In addition, Heron Therapeutics, Inc. is in Phase 3 development of HTX-011, a long-acting formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam for the prevention of post-operative pain. These products may reduce the amount of opioids required to achieve adequate pain control but usually do not obviate the need for opioids completely. Similarly, there are many IV formulations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, for treatment of acute pain, such as generic IV ketorolac, Pfizer’s DYLOJECT, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s CALDOLOR and recently Recro Pharma, Inc. resubmitted its NDA for IV meloxicam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. These products are all invasively administered via an IV and, as a result, we do not believe they are direct competitors to the non-invasive DSUVIA.
 
 13



Potential Competition for Zalviso

We are developing Zalviso for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients during hospitalization. We believe that Zalviso would compete with a number of opioid-based treatment options that are currently available, as well as some products that are in development. The hospital market for opioids for moderate-to-severe acute pain is large and competitive. The primary competition for Zalviso is the IV PCA pump, which is widely used in the moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting. Leading manufacturers of IV PCA pumps include Hospira, Inc. (sold by Pfizer, Inc. to ICU Medical), CareFusion Corporation (purchased by Becton, Dickinson and Company), Baxter International, Inc., Curlin Medical, Inc. and Smiths Medical. The most common opioids used to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain are morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl, all of which are available as generics both from generic product manufacturers as well as from compounding pharmacies. In addition, branded manufacturers (e.g., Hospira, Inc.) sell pre-filled glass syringes of morphine to fit their IV PCA pump systems. These systems, however, are invasive and require programming, which can lead to dosing errors, and therefore, while they are commonly used, we do not believe they are direct competitors for Zalviso.
 
Also available on the market is the Avancen Medication on Demand, or MOD, an oral PCA device developed by Avancen MOD Corporation. Oral opioids and other agents can be used in this system. Oral opioids tend to have slower onset than transmucosal opioids, such as Zalviso. The Medicine Company’s IONSYS is a non-invasive transdermal opioid PCA that could potentially compete with Zalviso; however, a worldwide recall of the product was announced due to a commercial refocusing of the company. Additional potential opioid competitors for Zalviso include Cara Therapeutics, Inc., who is developing a kappa opioid agonist, CR845, as an IV agent for the management of post-operative moderate-to-severe pain. Also, Trevena, Inc., is pursuing FDA approval for IV oliceridine, an intravenous G-protein biased ligand that targets the mu-opioid receptor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain, with a clinical development focus in acute post-operative pain. Both of these product candidates are invasive and, therefore, we do not believe they are direct competition to the non-invasive Zalviso.
 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Supply 
 
We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufentanil sublingual tablets for commercial production of DSUVIA and Zalviso under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, with oversight by our internal managers. Equipment specific to the pharmaceutical manufacturing process was purchased and customized for us and is currently owned by us. We plan to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our products, if and when approved for marketing by the FDA. We currently rely on a single manufacturer for the commercial supplies of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for DSUVIA and Zalviso, and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for either DSUVIA or Zalviso. We have identified other manufacturers that could satisfy our commercial supply and packaging requirements and we continue to evaluate those manufacturers.
Device Manufacturing and Supply 
 
All contract manufacturers and component suppliers have been selected for their specific competencies in the manufacturing processes and materials that make up DSUVIA and Zalviso. We currently rely on single manufacturers for the commercial supplies of our drug components and packaging for DSUVIA and Zalviso, and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for either DSUVIA or Zalviso. DSUVIA utilizes an SDA in the delivery of the tablets. FDA regulations require that materials be produced under cGMPs or Quality System Regulation, or QSR, as required for the respective unit operation within the manufacturing process. We outsource injection molding of all the plastic parts for the SDA, and product sub-assemblies; and filling, packaging and labeling of SDAs.
 
The device components of Zalviso are manufactured by contract manufacturers, component fabricators and secondary service providers. We outsource injection molding of all the plastic parts for the cartridge and device and product sub-assemblies; tablet cartridge filling and packaging; and assembly, packaging and labeling of the dispenser and controller.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as DSUVIA and Zalviso. Product candidates, such as Zalviso, must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
 
 14



In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with applicable laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply at any time during the product development and approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the clinical safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product and the drug substance(s) are produced to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of application, annual program fees; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that approval for our product candidate, Zalviso, will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Involves trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted conditions and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP and QSR for medical device requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
The results of product development, preclinical trials and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on our drug products, proposed labeling and other relevant information, will be submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug product, requesting approval to market the product in the United States. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may inspect our manufacturers for GMP and QSR compliance, and our pivotal clinical trial sites for GCP compliance.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 
 15



The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA issues a Complete Response Letter at the conclusion of its review if the NDA is not yet deemed ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 
If a product candidate does receive regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific conditions and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. DSUVIA was approved with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to mitigate the risk of respiratory depression resulting from accidental exposure by ensuring that DSUVIA is dispensed only to patients in certified medically supervised healthcare settings. Zalviso, if approved, will also require a REMS, which can include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan, elements to assure safe use and implementation system, and must include a timetable for assessment of the REMS. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug product’s safety and effectiveness after the NDA.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated clinical safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post marketing requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of NDA approval. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drug products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drug products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Drug product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drug products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. In the case of Zalviso, the device component must comply with FDA’s Quality Systems Regulation.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
 
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
 
Foreign Regulation 
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
 
 16



In June 2018, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing approval of DZUVEO for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically monitored settings. We currently intend to commercialize and promote DZUVEO in Europe with a strategic partner, although we have not yet entered into such an arrangement.
 
We are responsible for maintaining Zalviso device regulatory approval in the EU in order to support the manufacturing and supply of Zalviso to Grünenthal for commercial sales. We completed the Conformité Européenne approval process for the Zalviso device, more commonly known as a CE Mark approval. We received CE Mark approval in December 2014, which permits the commercial sale of the Zalviso device in the European Union. In connection with the CE Mark approval, we were also granted International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485:2003 certification of our quality management system. This is an internationally recognized quality standard for medical devices. The CE Mark was originally issued by the British Standards Institution, or BSI, a Notified Body, or NB, located in the United Kingdom, or UK, or BSI-UK. Recently, the CE Mark file and certification has been transferred to the Netherlands NB of BSI, or BSI-NL, to mitigate the uncertainty with regards to the Brexit situation. The ISO certification issued through BSI-UK was recently upgraded to the latest version of the standard, ISO 13484:2016 through BSI-UK and remains in effect, regardless of the Brexit situation. BSI ISO 13485:2016 certification recognizes that consistent quality policies and procedures are in place for the development, design and manufacturing of medical devices. The certification indicates that we have successfully implemented a quality system that conforms to ISO 13485 standards for medical devices. Certification to this standard is one of the key regulatory requirements for a CE Mark in the EU and EEA, as well as to meet equivalent requirements in other international markets.
 
Controlled Substances Regulations 
 
Sufentanil, a Schedule II controlled substance, is the API in DSUVIA and Zalviso. Controlled substances are governed by the DEA. Similarly, sufentanil is regulated as a controlled substance in Europe and other territories outside of the U.S. The handling of controlled substances and/or drug product by us, our contract manufacturers, analytical laboratories, packagers and distributors, are regulated by the Controlled Substances Act and regulations thereunder.
 
The Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013, or DSCSA, imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements are that manufacturers must provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. Further, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 
Unforeseen delays to the drug substance and drug product manufacture and supply chain may occur due to delays, errors or other unforeseen problems with the permitting and quota process. Also, any one of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, laboratories, packagers and/or distributors could be the subject of DEA violations and enforcement could lead to delays or even loss of DEA license by the contractors.
 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations 
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare program. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and/or formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices involving remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce purchasing, leasing or ordering may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. The failure to satisfy all of the requirements of an applicable exception or safe harbor do not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under an exception or safe harbor.
 
 17



Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act or PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
 
The federal civil False Claims Act and related laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Further, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to, among others, a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for a medical or other item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates that are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. International laws, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (EU 2016/679) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union and between countries in the European Union and countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies, for which federal healthcare program payment is available, report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. FDA and some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies. In addition, certain states such as California require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Sales of our products will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payers. These third-party payers are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Third-party payers and hospitals may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer and hospital separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that DSUVIA and Zalviso, once approved for commercial sale, will be considered cost-effective. Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payer-by-payer basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payer does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payer. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our approved products from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success. Third-party payers, government healthcare programs, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and hospitals frequently require that pharmaceutical companies negotiate agreements that provide discounts or rebates from list prices. We expect increasing pressure to offer larger discounts or discounts to a greater number of these organizations to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels for and access to our products. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by these mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs, private payers, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, hospitals, and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In addition, if our competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce sales of our products and harm our results of operations.
 
There have been, and there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to commercialize our products profitably. We anticipate that the federal and state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt and implement healthcare policies, such as the Affordable Care Act, intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include: controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government health care programs; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to or limits on the pricing of drugs, including pricing controls, or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third-party payers to make coverage and payment decisions.
 
In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our products from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability.
 
Healthcare Reform 
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain from non-governmental payers. Moreover, private payers often follow federal healthcare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.

Furthermore, political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change. Initiatives to reduce the federal deficit and to reform healthcare delivery are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents.
 
Legislative changes to the Affordable Care Act remain possible and appear likely in the 116th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Currently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal, or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health   coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. In July 2018, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the PPACA. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or repealed in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.
 
Further, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payer or policy actions, which may include cost containment and other healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
 
Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of DSUVIA, and Zalviso, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for approved products.

In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump Administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
Further, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
 
Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payeor will pay for the drug product. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment.
 
In the United States, the PPACA was enacted in an effort to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Aspects of PPACA that may impact our business include:
 

• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the recent U.S. District Court holding that the PPACA is unconstitutional has been appealed, its long term viability remains unclear. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027 unless Congressional action is taken. The American Tax Payer Relief Act further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals.
 
Moreover, the DSCSA imposes additional obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. AcelRx is engaging CMOs and solution providers in serialization to implement the requirements of the DSCSA on our products. The acceptability of the approach that AcelRx is implementing will be ultimately subject to review by the FDA.
 
Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and further restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our products, if any, may be.
