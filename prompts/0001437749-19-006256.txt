Ceramic Silicon Carbide Membranes for Liquid Filtration
 
Under the “LiqTech”, “Cometas” and “Provital” brand names, we manufacture and sell ceramic silicon carbide membranes and systems for liquid filtration using our patented silicon carbide technology (sometimes also referred to herein as our “SiC Filters”). Our currently focus is on marine scrubber bleed water, hydrocarbon production-derived contaminated water, which we refer to herein as “produced water”, removal of heavy metals in mining and energy applications, pre-filtration for reverse osmosis in drinking water and other industrial applications.

Our SiC Filters have been used in the following applications by our clients:
 

● | Marine scrubber bleed water: We supply water filtration systems for marine scrubber systems that may be employed on marine vessels to reduce sulphur emissions resulting from operating on heavy fuel oil (HFO). To date, more than 100 water treatment systems have been ordered by European and Asian scrubber technology providers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Produced water: Our membranes can be used for the filtration of "produced" water – a byproduct of oil and gas production. The amount of produced water varies between 0.1 to ten times the amount of oil produced. We have performed testing with major international private and public oil and gas companies. We have been awarded a contract by an international oil and gas company to provide and service produced water filters on one of its offshore platforms. Two additional commercial installations have been commissioned with LiqTech membranes.
● | Pre-filtration of reverse osmosis drinking water: Prior to passing through reverse osmosis membranes to produce drinking or industrial water from sea or surface water, the sea or surface water must be pre-filtered. We have performed successful tests for the pre-filtration of sea and surface water for this purpose with numerous clients. 
● | Industrial applications: We have delivered complete water treatment systems for certain targeted, aggressive fluids applications, such as the removal of heavy metals for energy providers in Denmark and Finland and the filtering of mining wastewater for a European mining company. 
● | Producing clean drinking water: The potential of LiqTech SiC Filters in drinking water production is diverse and the benefits are numerous. Some examples include ground water – removal of precipitated salts such as iron and manganese; surface water – removal of organic suspended solids and humic acid; and sea water – pre-filtration before reverse osmosis. We have entered into a cooperation agreement with a leading pump producer Grundfos to market a newly developed water treatment unit for ground water. 
● | Pool and spa water: We have supplied several turnkey water filtration systems for medium to very large public swimming pool installations in Europe. 

 
Our products are based on the following silicon carbide membrane technologies:
 

● | CoMem is a unique patented membrane technology that utilizes a cross-flow structure to handle high concentrations of suspended solids found, for example in produced water from the oil and chemical industry and wastewater from industrial processes and manure filtration; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Aqua Solution, which integrates a dead-end structural design with cutting-edge membrane technology in a solution specifically designed for applications in the pre-treatment for reverse osmosis, wastewater treatment and swimming pool and spa water filtration. 

 
Our SiC Filters are manufactured with a silicon carbide ceramic membrane based on a patented technology. We are not aware of other companies that makes both the substrate (honeycomb) and the membrane (the part which accomplishes the filtering) solely from silicon carbide.
 
The advantages of our SiC Filters compared to other pre-filtration systems for reverse osmosis are:
 

● | Our SiC Filters offer the same water flow as commonly used sand filters that require up to 400 times more space and have pore sizes at least three times bigger than our SiC Filters, and reduce the number of membrane elements and pressure vessels;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | With our SiC Filters, high flow capacities are achieved at very low pressures, which reduces energy costs; 
● | Our SiC Filters reduce water consumption for sand filter backwash; and 
● | Our SiC Filters eliminate the consumption or maintenance of filter cartridges.

Our SiC Filters offer consistent removal of oil and suspended solids at high throughput rates regardless of feed conditions. Our membranes are ideal for the treatment of scrubber wash water, produced water for discharge, re-injection, pre-reverse osmosis ("RO") as well as polymer flooded streams. We offer on shore and off shore solutions and have extensive experience with produced water streams for fracking, gas condensate, and oil emulsions. We believe our SiC Filters are the best alternative to micro-flotation and walnut shell filters due to their cost savings, reduced installation cost and robustness with reduced downtime. Our chemically inert plug-and-play filter designs are extremely hard, chemically resistant and durable materials with high flux (flow) to increase membrane life and reduce downtime for cleaning. SiC Filters are stronger, harder, longer lasting, more temperature resistant, and recover faster than conventional ceramic or polymeric membranes.
 
Our flat sheet membranes (“FSM”) offer low energy consumption, maximum permeation, innovative rack design, and high flux. These membranes are used in drinking water, pre-RO, and industrial wastewater reuse. The FSM carrier and the selective layer are also made of silicon carbide, which gives the product unique advantages such as high flux, total chemical resistance (pH 0-14), long life, and the lowest fouling tendency of any polymeric or ceramic membrane material. Our tubular membranes offer robust and high yield membrane solutions for produced water for the Oil & Gas market and industrial wastewater in removing suspended solids as well as oil droplets and oil-emulsions from solutions. Our dynamic high flux membrane disks are designed for the removal of high suspended solids. The filtration path direction is outside-in, with internal permeation channels that facilitate removal of the solids. A cross-flow effect is generated through the rotation of the discs at high velocities that enables flow cleaning of the filter membrane surface. This principle offers energy savings can exceed 80% compared to conventional cross flow.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we received grants from governmental entities of $431,340 and $458,064, respectively.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our sales of liquid filters, services and systems were $5,264,663 and $3,529,360, respectively, and accounted for 43% and 31% of our total sales, respectively.

Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs)
 
We offer diesel particulate filters for exhaust emission control solutions to the verified retrofit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market through our direct sales force. DPF sales are generally made to distributors specializing in sales to end users. We use a proprietary “nano washcoat” to provide catalytic coating for anything from diesel particulate filters to catalytic converters. We have developed a robust silicon carbide diesel particulate filter that is especially effective for vehicles that produce a high soot load, and, if properly maintained, should last as long as the vehicle’s engine. Our DPFs are ideal for off-road vehicles because of their strength, chemical non-reactive nature, temperature resilience and thermal conductivity. Our DPF products are sold worldwide under the LiqTech brand name. 
 
Our DPF Filters can handle higher soot loads than filters that do not use a silicon carbide membrane, which makes them ideal for situations in which engines infrequently reach high enough temperatures to burn off soot. Examples include:
 

● | Garbage trucks; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Port vehicles; 
● | Diesel pickup trucks not carrying a full load; 
● | Off-road construction vehicles that idle for long periods of time; and
● | Intra-city vehicles that do not reach highway speeds. 

 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our sales of DPFs were $6,536,085 and $7,230,416, respectively, and accounted for 53% and 64% of our total sales, respectively.
 
Kiln Furniture
 
Kiln furniture refers to all items used in a kiln to support ceramics and create additional space to maximize the number of items for each firing. Our high-quality SiC kiln furniture is thinner (allowing more items to be added for each firing), withstands higher heat, lasts longer and reduces the firing time (reducing energy costs) as compared to cordierite, mullite and oxide bonded kiln furniture.
 
Although we have produced kiln furniture as a way to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing process and not as one of our primary products, we intend to phase out this commercial product over time.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our kiln furniture revenues were $0 and $125,337, respectively, and accounted for 0% and 1% of our total sales, respectively.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following strengths position us to increase our revenue and profitability:
 

● | Advantages of Silicon Carbide Membranes: Our diesel exhaust and liquid filtration products utilize silicon carbide membranes, which have certain qualities that we believe make our products more effective than those of our competitors. Unlike filtration products that use aluminum oxide, silicon carbide membranes are chemically inert and temperature resistant. Furthermore, silicon carbide membranes exhibit a high degree of hydrophilicity (tendency of a surface to become wet or to absorb water) that results in unique flux (low energy consumption). Silicon carbide is also very durable with hardness second only to diamonds, making it a highly desirable material for a variety of aggressive fluids in industrial applications. As a result, we believe that such superior properties make our products desirable in both exhaust emissions control products and liquid filtration products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Complete systems fabrication: LiqTech provides full fabrication and integration of our membranes into complete filtration systems made from corrosive resistant materials and components. We provide complete in-house engineering capabilities for process design, 3D modelling and controls. The entire specification, engineering, fabrication and commissioning process is delivered by our professional staff of highly-dedicated engineers and craftsmen. We believe that suppling our customers with turnkey solutions built upon our silicon carbide membranes is unique in the market. LiqTech is more than a membrane supplier—we see ourselves as a provider of complete water treatment systems. 
● | Broad Application of LiqTech Membranes: Our membranes can be applied in a variety of applications, including: filtration of marine scrubber wash water, processing of industrial waste water and produced water, pre-treatment of drinking water, pre-filtration for reverse osmosis, oil emulsion separation, bacteria removal for aquaculture, commercial swimming pool water treatment and the separation of metals from liquids in industrial processes. 
● | Marketing and Manufacturing in Key Markets and Expanding to Other Market: We have production and sales capacity in North America and Europe. We also sell our products through distributors and agents in many other countries such as China, Spain, UK, Korea, France, Italy and Brazil. We have established customer relations in more than 25 countries. 
● | Strong and Experienced Management Team: Our management team has deep experience in the clean technology and filtration industries and drives growth through the development of new applications and technologies, and cultivating relationships with customers. 

Our Strategy 
 
Our strategy is to create stockholder value by leveraging our competitive strengths in silicon carbide filters and membranes by focusing on discrete applications in key end markets. Essential features of our strategy include:

● | Continue to maintain and gain new marine industry customers. We currently provide water filtration systems for scrubber technology providers, ship owners and ship operators. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enter new geographic markets and expand existing markets. We plan to continue to manufacture and sell our products from our core operations in Denmark and the United States. We work with distributors, agents and partners to access other important geographic markets. 
● | Continue to strengthen our position in the DPF market. We believe that we have a strong position in the retrofit market for diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems. We intend to continue our efforts to maintain our market position in this area. Furthermore, we intend to leverage our experience in the OEM market by expanding our presence with new products relating to diesel particulate filter systems.

● | Continue to develop and improve technologies and open new end markets. We intend to continue to develop our ceramic membranes and improve the filtration efficiency for our filtration products. Through continuous research and development, we intend to find new uses for our products and plan to expand into new markets that offer significant opportunity for the Company. One of our key strategies is to develop our membrane applications in partnership with our customers including, for example, the development of the next generation of diesel particulate filters with asymmetric design for the OEM market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue our focus on the development and sales of standardized systems. We will continue our focus on selling systems based on our unique SIC Filters. We will also combine the ceramic membranes with other technologies to be able to offer our customers complete filtration solutions. We will continue our focus on developing smaller standard systems, like our ground water treatment system and our residential swimming pool system. 

Our Industry 
 
Overview
 
We primarily serve two industries: the liquid filtration system market and the diesel particle filter (DPF) market. Our goal is to leverage our products and technology into industrial liquid filtration applications that offer significant growth opportunity and to take advantage of favorable market trends.
Liquid Filtration Market
 
The market for marine water filtration systems is rapidly developing due to new regulations for sulphur and ballast water emissions. Industry experts estimate that 8,000-10,000 ships will install a scrubber water treatment system over the next five to seven years (2018 Market Research Report on Global Marine Scrubber By Players, Type and Applications, Status and Forecast, 2012-2022).  The use of wet scrubbers to clean the exhaust from marine engines that use high sulphur residual oil and diesel fuels may lead to the discharge of high concentrations of harmful compounds in the waters from vessels using such scrubbers. Several trials have been conducted onboard vessels by scrubber suppliers to define the constituent concentrations in wash water discharge. The trials found that scrubber wash water also contains suspended solids, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Before the scrubber wash water is discharged, it must be treated to remove solids. LiqTech’s water treatment systems can be used to remove the solids from wet scrubber wash water. The treatment process includes a pre-filtration step followed by a LiqTech SiC membrane filtration. Treated water quality is monitored (NTU, PAH and pH) before discharge.  The Company is globally engaging with scrubber equipment suppliers, ship owner/operators and ship yards. Furthermore, we are presenting the water treatment solutions at marine conferences and trade shows.
 
In addition to our marine scrubbers, LiqTech offers packaged systems consisting of ceramic SiC and conventional reverse-osmosis (RO) membranes for industrial and municipal customers. We anticipate that global demand will increase for robust and low operating expense products such as ours that are well suited for mobile and modular systems. RO membranes are increasingly being used for the production of drinking water (desalination of sea water or brackish water), for demineralized water in industrial processes (boiler feed water, microelectronics production), as well as in food processing and pharmaceuticals production. In addition, many laboratories rely on pure water for which demineralization is an essential step. LiqTech is differentiated by what we believe is our superior SiC membrane technology and by being able to provide a complete water treatment system. According to Lux Research, an industry expert, the aggregate water volume treated by membranes is expected to grow from 29 billion cubic meters in 2009 to 82 billion cubic meters in 2020.
 
We also see a general trend worldwide of increasing demand for higher quality re-injection water in connection with unconventional oil and gas production. In addition, we see tightening water discharge legislation, increasing water cuts (more water produced per barrel oil) and the introduction of Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) techniques. The tightening of produced water specifications is a problem for conventional treatment and filtration technologies. However, our SiC Filters have been shown to mitigate these challenges and we believe the increasing demand represents a favorable market trends for our business.
 
Water is essential to life on earth, and clean water shortages are expected to affect two-thirds of the human population by 2025 (Worldwildlife). One-third of the human population is living today without clean water, and this is expected to increase to two-thirds of the population by 2025 due to the growing population (United Nations). According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.6 million children die every year due to unsafe water and the lack of basic sanitation. Due to the growing need for pure water for drinking and industrial purposes, the market for water filtration is growing rapidly, with more and larger plants being commissioned all over the world.

Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Market
 
The increase in global regulation of diesel engine exhaust particles is expected to drive growth in the DPF market. We expect jurisdictions in the United States to begin requiring DPF filters. In Europe, for example, cities in Germany are setting requirements for off-road machinery requirements for DPF filters. According to an industry publication, the global market for new DPF filters manufactured by OEMs is expected to increase from approximately 1.7 million units in 2010 to over 9 million units in 2020. Diesel emissions consist of several toxic gases and particles: particulate matter (soot), carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. Soot has been linked to a variety of health problems in humans. Abt Associates, for the Clean Air Task Force, estimates that approximately 21,000 people in the U.S. die prematurely each year from breathing diesel soot, 3,000 of those from lung cancer. Another 27,000 heart attacks, 14,500 hospitalizations and 2.4 million lost work days a year are attributable to diesel particulate matter exposures. In 2010, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that diesel transport represented 50% of the total ambient air pollution in OECD countries, which equates to over $785 billion in health damages. The Abt Associates report, using EPA science advisory board methodology, estimated that the monetary value of the health damages from diesel-related particulate matter in the U.S. was approximately $139 billion (in 1999 dollars). Reducing diesel emissions will have both health benefits and social benefits, along with reduced costs.
 
In response to these health impacts, governments have been implementing legislation to regulate emissions from diesel engines. California implemented the Diesel Risk Reduction Plan, which required the curtailment of diesel particle emissions by 25% by 2010 and a further 15% by 2020. New York City has implemented binding directives for the retrofitting of buses, garbage trucks and construction machines. In the European Union, Directive EC 715/2007 of June 20, 2007 defined particle count limits for certain cars and light utility vehicles. Also, in Europe, low emission zones have been implemented locally, creating a patchwork of regulation. The increase in global regulation of diesel engine exhaust particles is expected to drive growth in the DPF market.
 
The Asian markets have shown economic growth and an improved standard of living that has led to increased sales of vehicles in the region. At the same time, the pollution in major cities has reached high PM levels. As a result, we believe that the Chinese government could introduce additional regulations, including new emissions standards faster than previously anticipated. We also believe the high pollution levels will result in an increase in the need for retrofitting existing vehicles.
 
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture our products in facilities located in Ballerup, Denmark and White Bear Lake, Minnesota, and assemble our systems in LiqTech Systems, located in Hobro in Jutland, Denmark. We are planning to expand our production capacity, primarily through investment in additional equipment for our liquid filtration products.
Raw Materials
 
The main raw materials that we use in our manufacturing processes are silicon carbide, steel, plastic, platinum and palladium. We purchase these commodities from various sources generally based upon availability and price. There is a limited supply of silicon carbide available to us. As other industries develop products utilizing silicon carbide, we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of silicon carbide required for the manufacture of our existing and planned future water filtration products. Any increased demand for silicon carbide, platinum or palladium could increase the price we must pay to obtain it and could adversely affect our profitability. However, management believes that we could obtain satisfactory substitutes for these materials should they become unavailable.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Our products are sold primarily to large industrial customers that use our products for gas and liquid filtration. The Company sells through direct sales people, systems integrators, distributors, agents and partners. 
 
The Company initially focused on selling its DPF filters to the automotive industry. In 2014, we acquired LiqTech Systems (formerly known as Provital), a Danish filtration systems manufacturing company, which has enabled us to shift our focus to providing complete, modular liquid filtration systems. The Company’s liquid filtration systems business is now rapidly expanding, focusing on the marine industry and other industrial applications in mining, power generation, aquaculture, oil and gas, and other applications within the pool industry, water reclamation and drinking water.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 10%, 9%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of our net sales (approximately 31% in total). For the year ended December 31, 2017, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 16%, 10%, 7% and 5%, respectively, of our net sales (approximately 38% in total). If we are unable to diversify our customer base, our future results will be heavily dependent on these customers. 
 
We plan to actively market our existing products to new customers as we increase our production capacity. As of March 2019, we had eight (8) full time salesmen or distribution agents. We promote our products through direct contact to potential customers and by meeting potential customers in trade fairs and exhibitions.
 
In certain instances, our products are delivered to the end customer through systems integrators. These systems integrators use our filtration products in larger filtration systems, which eventually are installed in products used by the end customer. Due to legislative regulation, systems integrators are often required by end customers to receive approval of their systems, including the components used in such systems, which requires significant time and expense. As a result, we believe that certain of the systems integrators that use our products will not replace our filters with competitive products unless there is good reason.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have one issued United States patent that we co-own with a third party, two issued Danish patents, three issued foreign patents (Germany, China and South Korea) that we co-own with a third party and one pending European patent application which we co-own with a third party. The United States patent that we co-own is generally effective for 20 years from the filing date (July 8, 2004) of the earliest U.S. or international application to which it claims priority. The scope and duration of each of our foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. On July 7, 2014, we obtained a new Danish patent application related to the silicon carbide membrane technology in Denmark.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Trade secrets, however, can be difficult to protect. We may not be able to maintain our technology or know-how as trade secrets, and competitors may develop or acquire equally valuable or more valuable technology or know-how related to the manufacture of comparable silicon carbide products. We also seek to protect our confidential and proprietary information, in part, by requiring all employees, consultants and business partners to execute confidentiality and/or nondisclosure agreements upon the commencement of any employment, consulting arrangement or engagement with us. These agreements generally require that all confidential and proprietary information developed by the employee, consultant or business partner, or made known to the employee, consultant or business partner by us, during the course of the relationship with us, be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties.
 
We also believe that having distinctive names may be an important factor in marketing our products, and therefore use trademarks to brand some of our products. As of March 2019, we had one trademark registration in the United States (LiqTech NA) and four trademark registrations in the European Union (AQUA SOLUTION, CoMem, CDPX and FUTURE FILTRATION).
 
Government Regulation
 
We do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations affecting our products in the countries in which we have operations, except that in Minnesota, we are required to comply with the Minnesota Air Pollution standards related to the use of our incinerators located in our Minnesota facilities. We are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupation Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including Denmark, where we are subject to various regulations. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly workplace for all of our employees and those who work with us.
Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage, disposal and release of waste and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental requirements at each of our facilities. We are also subject to laws such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on-site or off-site locations. We are subject to similar requirements in Denmark and other European countries. From time to time, we have identified minor environmental compliance issues at our facilities. To date, compliance with environmental matters has not had a material effect upon the Company’s capital expenditures or competitive position.
 
 8


We believe that, due to the constant focus on the environment and clean air and clean water standards throughout the world, a requirement in the future to adhere to new and more stringent regulations both in the U.S. and abroad is likely as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air and water. In the event our products fail to meet these changing standards, some or all of our products may become obsolete, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.
 
Research and Development
 
We have nine (9) full-time employees spending a majority of their working hours on research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we spent $661,014 and $536,848, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development.
Competition 
 
Our products compete with other filters that are made using both ceramic and plastic membranes. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies. However, we believe our patented technology allows us to produce high quality, products that give us an advantage over many of our competitors, many of which have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources. We intend to continue to devote resources to developing new technologies and improving our products in order to maintain our existing customers and to add new customers.
Employees
 
We have 76 employees, 70 of whom were full-time employees. We have 65 employees at our operations in Denmark, including 9 in research and development, 8 in sales and engineering and 2 in executive management. We also have 11 employees in the United States sales, accounting and production.
 
Certain labor employees in Denmark are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of such Danish employees, no other employees are members of a labor union or are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
