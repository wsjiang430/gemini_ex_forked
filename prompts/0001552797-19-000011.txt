ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General 
Delek Logistics Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2012 by Delek US Holdings, Inc. ("Delek Holdings") and its subsidiary Delek Logistics GP, LLC, our general partner (our "general partner"). In November 2012, we completed our initial public offering. 
We own crude oil, intermediate and refined products pipelines and transportation, storage, wholesale marketing, terminalling and offloading assets which were previously owned, operated or held by Delek Holdings and assets acquired from unrelated third parties. Delek Holdings is our primary customer and is responsible, directly and indirectly, for the majority of our contribution margin (as defined in "—Major Customers" ). 
Overview
We primarily own and operate logistics and marketing assets for crude oil and intermediate and refined products. We generate revenue and contribution margin, which we define as net revenues less cost of materials and other and operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, by charging fees for gathering, transporting, offloading and storing crude oil; for storing intermediate products and feed stocks; for distributing, transporting and storing refined products; and for wholesale marketing. A substantial majority of our existing assets are both integral to and dependent on the success of Delek Holdings' refining operations and most of our assets are contracted exclusively to Delek Holdings in support of Delek Holdings' refineries in Tyler, Texas (the "Tyler Refinery"), El Dorado, Arkansas (the "El Dorado Refinery") and Big Spring, Texas (the "Big Spring Refinery"). See "Commercial Agreements—Commercial Agreements with Delek Holdings" and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek Holdings. In addition to the services we provide to Delek Holdings, we also provide, and generate substantial revenue and contribution margin from, crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation services for, and terminalling and marketing services to, third parties primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas. Certain of these services are provided pursuant to contractual agreements with such third parties. See "Commercial Agreements—Other Agreements with Third Parties."
We are not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of such income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and the fair market value of our assets and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities, the acquisition price of the partner's units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the Partnership's First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement").

2018 Developments 
DKL Credit Facility 
On September 28, 2018, the Partnership entered into a third amended and restated senior secured revolving credit agreement (the "DKL Credit Facility"). See Note 10 for additional information. Under the terms of the DKL Credit Facility, among other things, (i) the lender commitments were increased from $700.0 million under the prior facility to $850.0 million, (ii) the accordion feature whereby the Partnership can increase the size of the credit facility increased from $100.0 million in incremental commitments under the prior facility to $150.0 million, for an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion, subject to increased or new commitments from lenders and the satisfaction of certain other conditions precedent and (iii) the maturity date was extended from December 30, 2019 under the prior facility to September 28, 2023. The terms of certain of our agreements with Delek Holdings were required to be extended pursuant to the amended and restated DKL Credit Facility, which extensions were effective in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Inflation Adjustments
On July 1, 2018, the tariffs on our Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC") regulated pipelines and the throughput fees and storage fees under certain of our agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties that are subject to adjustment using FERC indexing increased by approximately 4.4%, the amount of the change in the FERC oil pipeline index. Under certain of our other agreements with Delek Holdings and third parties, the fees increased based on the consumer price index or the producer price index, which increased approximately 2.2% and 6.1%, respectively. 
2025 Notes Offer to Exchange
On April 25, 2018, we made an offer to exchange the 2025 Notes (as defined in Note 10 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) and the related guarantees that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn for an equal principal amount of exchange notes that are freely tradeable, as required under the terms of the original indenture (the "Exchange Offer"). The Exchange Offer expired on May 23, 2018 (the "Expiration Date"). The terms of the exchange notes that were issued as a result of the Exchange Offer are substantially identical to the terms of the original 2025 Notes.
Big Spring Logistics Assets Acquisition
Effective March 1, 2018, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Big Spring, LLC, acquired from Delek Holdings certain logistics assets primarily located at or adjacent to Delek Holdings' refinery near Big Spring, Texas (the "Big Spring Refinery") and Delek Holdings' light products distribution terminal located in Stephens County, Oklahoma (collectively, the "Big Spring Logistic Assets", and such transaction the "Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition"). The purchase price was $170.8 million, financed through borrowings under the Partnership’s revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Marketing Contract Intangible Acquisition
Effective March 1, 2018, concurrent with the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition, Delek Holdings, the Partnership and various of their respective subsidiaries entered into a new marketing agreement, whereby the Partnership markets certain refined products produced at the Big Spring Refinery to various customers in return for a marketing fee (the "Big Spring Marketing Agreement"). The purchase price was $144.2 million, financed through borrowings under the Partnership's revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Assets and Operations
We prepare segment information on the same basis that we review financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Currently, our business consists of two operating segments: (i) pipelines and transportation and (ii) wholesale marketing and terminalling. Additional segment and financial information is contained in our segment results included in Item 6, Selected Financial Data; Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Note 15, Segment Data, of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our principal assets, as of December 31, 2018, are described below under the segment that uses such assets. 
The following provides an overview of our assets and operations:

Business

Pipelines and Transportation Segment
Our pipelines and transportation segment consists of assets, including pipelines and trucks and ancillary assets, that provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services primarily in support of the Tyler, El Dorado and Big Spring Refineries. Additionally, this segment provides crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation and storage services to Delek Holdings and third parties. In providing these services, we do not take ownership of the products or crude oil that we transport or store; and, therefore, the results of our pipelines and transportation segment are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices. Our pipeline assets include approximately 400 miles of operable crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 450 miles of refined product pipelines and approximately 600 miles of crude oil gathering and trunk lines. Associated with and currently used in connection with the operation of these lines are crude oil, intermediate and refined products storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately 9.6 million barrels of active shell capacity. 
The rates and terms and conditions of service on certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”) and by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we transport crude oil, intermediate and refined products, including the Texas Railroad Commission, the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the Arkansas Public Service Commission. Certain of our pipeline systems are subject to such regulation and have filed tariffs with the appropriate authorities. We also comply with the reporting requirements for these pipelines. Other of our pipelines have received a waiver from application of the FERC's tariff requirements, but comply with other applicable regulatory requirements. See "Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters—Rate Regulation of Petroleum Pipelines" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on FERC imposed tariffs. 
The following discussion and tables present the results of operations and certain operating statistics of the pipeline and transportation segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Lion Pipeline System 
Our Lion Pipeline System is a system of common carrier pipelines that transport crude oil to, and refined products from, Delek Holdings' El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System consists primarily of:

• | the Magnolia Pipeline system;


• | the Magnolia Station located west of the El Dorado Refinery;


• | the El Dorado Pipeline system;


• | multiple short crude oil pipelines located at the El Dorado Refinery and our Sandhill Station;


• | the Refined Products Pipeline system; and


• | certain related crude oil pipelines.

The Magnolia Pipeline is an approximately 77-mile crude oil pipeline, with both 12-inch and 16-inch diameters depending on the section of the pipeline, and a capacity of approximately 68,500 barrels per day ("bpd"). The Magnolia Pipeline runs from a connection with ETP/ExxonMobil’s LOLA System near Shreveport, Louisiana to our Magnolia Station, where the crude oil is then stored and transferred to our El Dorado Pipeline. In addition, third-party pipelines connect to the Magnolia Pipeline near Haynesville, Louisiana, which allows for the receipt of crude oil transported from Longview, Texas. 
The Magnolia Station is a location, owned by us, where the Magnolia and Lion Pipelines and SALA Gathering System have origination and destination points, as the case may be. In addition, the Magnolia Station has storage facilities with approximately 230,000 barrels of active shell capacity.    
The El Dorado Pipeline is a 31-mile, 12-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 22,000 bpd, which transports crude oil from our Magnolia Station to Delek Holdings' Sandhill Station adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery. Upon reaching Sandhill Station, the crude oil from the El Dorado Pipeline is transported, via multiple short crude oil pipelines owned by us, to Tank 192, a 150,000 barrel capacity storage tank ("Tank 192") or to Tank 120, an 80,000 barrel capacity storage tank ("Tank 120"), which receives heavier asphaltic crudes. At present, substantially all crude oil that enters the El Dorado Refinery, including the crude oil gathered on the SALA Gathering System, is routed through Sandhill Station. Through our SALA subsidiary, we own Tank 192 and Tank 120 and lease the underlying ground from Lion Oil under a long-term ground lease. 
We also own two refined product pipelines that transport gasoline and diesel from the El Dorado Refinery to the nearby Enterprise TE Products Pipeline El Dorado Station (the “Refined Products Pipelines”). Pursuant to a capacity lease with Enterprise dated October 24, 2013, we also lease capacity of approximately 11,000 bpd on the approximately 240-mile Enterprise Products Pipeline from Enterprise's El Dorado Station to our refined products terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. The Refined Products Pipelines along with the leased capacity are collectively referred to as the "Refined Products Pipeline System." The diesel line is approximately eight miles and is 12 inches in diameter, while the gasoline line is approximately eight miles and is 10 inches in diameter. These two lines commence at the El Dorado Refinery. 
The pipelines in the Lion Pipeline System also have injection points where crude oil gathered from the SALA Gathering System can be injected and then transported to the El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System also has crude oil storage tanks and facilities ancillary to the operation of the pipeline system. Tankage assets include158 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent 
 6

Business

to the El Dorado Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.5 million barrels (the "El Dorado Tank Assets"). The Lion Pipeline System is capable of transporting crude oil offloaded from rail cars at or near the El Dorado Refinery, including two crude oil rail offloading racks, which are designed to receive up to 25,000 bpd of light crude oil or 12,000 bpd of heavy crude oil, or any combination of the two. 
SALA Gathering System
The SALA Gathering System is a system of common carrier pipelines that primarily gathers and transports crude oil and condensate that is purchased from various crude oil producers in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana by Delek Holdings or a third party to whom Delek Holdings has assigned certain of its rights. The SALA Gathering System includes approximately 600 miles of two- to eight-inch crude oil gathering and transportation lines in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana, located primarily within a 60-mile radius of the El Dorado Refinery. In addition, the gathering system transports small volumes of crude oil that are received from other sources and condensate that is purchased from a third party in east Texas. All such crude oil and other products are ultimately transported to the El Dorado Refinery for processing. In addition, a pipeline within the SALA Gathering System transports minimal crude oil for third party shippers pursuant to a common carrier tariff. 
The SALA Gathering System includes 54 crude oil storage tanks and breakout tanks with a total combined active shell capacity of approximately 0.3 million barrels (including Tank 120, Tank 192 and approximately 37,000 barrels of capacity we lease to an unrelated third party), 17 truck receipt locations, approximately 500 pipeline gathering and receiving stations and 17 relay stations to deliver crude oil to the Magnolia Station, the El Dorado Pipeline System or directly to the El Dorado Refinery. We also have approximately 0.6 million barrels of combined shell capacity that is currently not in service. 
 Currently, we are in the process of decommissioning certain sections of the SALA Gathering System in an effort to improve the safety and integrity of the system. We do not expect for the decommissioning of certain gathering lines on the system to have a material effect on the operational capabilities of the system.
The table below details certain operating data for our Lion Pipeline System and our SALA Gathering System. 

 | Average Daily Throughput (bpd)

SALA Gathering System | 16,571 | 15,871 | 17,756

(1) Excludes crude oil gathered on our SALA Gathering System and injected into our Lion Pipeline System.
Paline Pipeline System
Our Paline Pipeline System is approximately a 195-mile, 10-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 42,000 bpd, running from Longview, Texas to the Phillips 66-operated Beaumont terminal in Nederland, Texas. It includes a three-mile section that runs north from Kilgore, Texas. Our Paline Pipeline System is operated as a common carrier pipeline. See "Commercial Agreements—Other Agreements with Third Parties—Paline Pipeline System Capacity Reservation" for additional information on the use of our Paline Pipeline System.
East Texas Crude Logistics System 
Our East Texas Crude Logistics System includes two owned and operated crude oil pipeline systems and their related tank farms, which serve the Tyler Refinery: (i) the Nettleton pipeline, a bi-directional 36-mile pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 25,000 bpd, that is capable of transporting crude oil from our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas to (a) the Bullard Junction at the Tyler Refinery and (b) other of our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas, and (ii) the McMurrey Pipeline System, a 61-mile pipeline system, with a capacity of approximately 24,000 bpd, that transports crude oil from our tank farms in and around Longview, Texas and runs roughly parallel to the Nettleton Pipeline. 
Our East Texas Crude Logistics System also includes five owned or leased crude oil storage terminals, at which we store crude oil owned by Delek Holdings for the Tyler Refinery. The LaGloria Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. The Nettleton Station consists of five tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels. It is located on property that we lease from a third party, as described in more detail in Item 2, Properties. In addition to the active shell capacity, the Nettleton Station includes approximately 55,000 barrels of shell capacity that is currently not in service. The Bradford Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 55,000 barrels. In addition to the active shell capacity, the Bradford Station includes approximately 10,000 barrels of shell capacity that is currently not in service. The Arp Station consists of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 55,000 barrels. In addition to the active shell

capacity, the Arp Station includes approximately 55,000 barrels of shell capacity currently not in service. The Big Sandy Station consists of seven tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 247,600 barrels. 
The table below sets forth historical average daily throughput for the East Texas Crude Logistics System. 

 | Average Daily Throughput (bpd)
 | Year Ended 
 | | December 31, | | 
 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016
East Texas Crude Logistics System (average bpd) | 15,696 | | 15,780 | | 12,735

We have a pipelines and tankage agreement with Delek Holdings to provide throughput on the East Texas Crude Logistics System. Delek Holdings has a 10-year agreement, with an initial term expiring in 2023, with third parties to transport a substantial majority of the Tyler Refinery’s crude oil requirements on this pipeline system. As a result of the third parties' ability to transport crude oil on the pipeline system directly to the Tyler Refinery, the crude oil supplied through the Nettleton and McMurrey Pipelines is generally below the minimum aggregate throughput requirements of our pipelines and tankage agreement with Delek Holdings. However, Delek Holdings is required under its commercial agreement with us, to pay us throughput fees in an amount equal to the fees it would pay were we to throughput 35,000 bpd, based on the per barrel fees in our agreement. The current term of this agreement expires in March 2024. 
Tyler Assets 
The Partnership owns various pipeline and tankage assets that support the Tyler Refinery. These assets include a crude oil storage tank and certain ancillary assets located adjacent to the Tyler Refinery (the "Tyler Crude Tank"). The Tyler Crude Tank has approximately 350,000 barrels of shell capacity. In addition, we own 96 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the Tyler Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.0 million barrels (the "Tyler Tank Assets"). 
The Tyler-Big Sandy Product Pipeline is a pipeline that runs between the Tyler Refinery and the Partnership's terminal at Big Sandy, Texas. The line consists of two segments: (i) the Hopewell Pipeline, an approximately 13-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 30,000 bpd, which originates at the Tyler Refinery and terminates at the Hopewell Station, and (ii) the Big Sandy Pipeline, a 19-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 30,000 bpd, which originates at the Hopewell Station and terminates at the Big Sandy Terminal. The Big Sandy Terminal has seven tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 248,000 barrels. Service on the Tyler-Big Sandy Product Pipeline is not provided to third parties, and is classified as private intrastate carrier service. 
Big Spring Assets 
In September 2017, the Partnership, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Delek Marketing & Supply, LP acquired from Plains Pipeline, L.P. an approximate 40-mile pipeline and related ancillary assets (the "Big Spring Pipeline"). The Big Spring Pipeline originates in Big Spring, Texas and terminates in Midland, Texas. 
Also located in Big Spring, Texas is a truck unloading station located at the Big Spring Refinery (the "Big Spring Truck Unloading Station"). The Big Spring Truck Unloading Station is designed to receive up to 10,000 bpd of crude oil. 
In March 2018, the Partnership, through its wholly-owned subsidiary DKL Big Spring, LLC, acquired the Big Spring Logistic Assets from Delek Holdings, which are primarily located at or adjacent to the Big Spring Refinery. The Big Spring Logistic Assets include approximately 75 storage tanks, four salt wells and certain ancillary assets (such as tank pumps and piping) primarily located adjacent to the Big Spring Refinery with an active shell capacity of approximately 3.0 million barrels as well as certain crude oil and refined product pipelines. The primary crude oil pipeline is a 10-mile pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 250,000 bpd. The refined product pipeline is a 40-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 20,000 bpd.
Other Pipeline and Transportation Assets 
The Partnership also owns additional assets that are used to support Delek Holdings' refineries or that are used in our operations but may not be adjacent to or directly on the properties owned by such refineries. These include various pipelines and tankage assets and trucking assets listed below: 

• | five tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels at a terminal in North Little Rock, Arkansas;


• | 125 tractors and 166 trailers, which are owned or leased, and used to haul primarily crude oil and other products for related and third parties;

Business


• | an approximately 60-mile pipeline that transports crude oil from the Exxon Talco field to the ETP/ExxonMobil LOLA pipeline injection point in the East Texas Longview Station; and


• | an 85-mile pipeline, connecting the Greenville Storage Facility and the Mount Pleasant Terminal, which storage facility has four tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 230,000 barrels and is connected to the Explorer Pipeline System. In addition to the active shell capacity, the Greenville Storage Facility includes approximately 100,000 barrels of shell capacity that is currently not in service.

Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment
Our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment provides wholesale marketing and terminalling services to Delek Holdings’ refining operations and to independent third parties from whom we receive fees for marketing, transporting, storing and terminalling refined products and to whom we wholesale market refined products. In providing certain of these services, we take ownership of the products and are therefore exposed to market risks related to the volatility of refined product prices in our west Texas operations, which depend on many factors, including demand and supply of refined products in the west Texas market, the timing of refined product deliveries and downtime at refineries in the surrounding area. Effective March 1, 2018, this segment also includes the wholesale marketing and terminalling assets acquired in the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, we generated revenue in our wholesale marketing and terminalling segment by (i) providing marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery and the Big Spring Refinery, (ii) engaging in wholesale activity at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals, as well as at terminals owned by third parties, whereby we purchase light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and (iii) providing terminalling services to independent third parties and Delek Holdings. See “Commercial Agreements—Other Agreements with Third Parties—West Texas." Also see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek Holdings. The tables below show the operating results for the wholesale marketing and terminalling segment. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we present the results for the period during which we owned the assets, as delineated in any notes accompanying the tables. 
Wholesale Marketing
East Texas 
Pursuant to a marketing agreement with Delek Holdings, we market 100% of the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery, other than jet fuel and petroleum coke.

West Texas 
In our west Texas marketing operations, we generate revenue by purchasing refined products from independent third-party suppliers and from Delek Holdings for sale and exchange to third parties at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals and at third-party terminals located elsewhere in Texas. Our terminals in Abilene and San Angelo, Texas were leased for nominal consideration to Noble Petro, Inc. ("Noble Petro") pursuant to a terminal and pipeline lease and operating agreement, which expired on December 31, 2017. 
We own approximately 100 miles of product pipelines in west Texas that connect our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals to the Magellan Orion Pipeline. These pipelines were leased to Noble Petro until December 31, 2017. At these terminals, Noble Petro also regularly sold petroleum products to us pursuant to the terms of a supply contract with Noble Petro that expired in December 2017 (the "Abilene Contract"). We then marketed these petroleum products to third parties. As of January 1, 2018, these regular sales of product by Noble Petro to us concluded. We are currently purchasing products from Delek Holdings and third parties at our Abilene and San Angelo terminals. To facilitate these purchases, we have constructed a pipeline into our Abilene Terminal to receive product from the pipeline owned by Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: HEP) through which Delek Holdings ships product that is produced at the Big Spring Refinery. We also have active connections to the Magellan Orion Pipeline that enable us to ship product to our terminals and to acquire product from other shippers. The table below provides the location of the Abilene and San Angelo terminals associated with our marketing activities and the number of tanks, their storage capacities, number of truck loading lanes and maximum daily available truck loading capacity for the year ended December 31, 2018.

opted to renew these agreements for subsequent five-year terms expiring in November 2022. In the case of our marketing agreement with Delek Holdings in respect to the Tyler Refinery, the initial term has been extended through 2026. The current term of certain of our agreements with Delek Holdings were required to be further extended pursuant to the amended and restated DKL Credit Facility, which extensions were effective in the fourth quarter of 2018 and extend through March 2024. These agreements typically include minimum quarterly volume, revenue or throughput commitments. Fees under each agreement are payable to us monthly by Delek Holdings or certain third parties to whom Delek Holdings has assigned certain of its rights. For a discussion of a third party's involvement in certain agreements, see "Delek Holdings' Crude Oil and Refined Products Supply and Offtake Arrangement." In most circumstances, if Delek Holdings or the applicable third party assignee fails to meet or exceed the minimum volume, throughput or other commitment during any calendar quarter, Delek Holdings, and not any third party assignee, will be required to make a quarterly shortfall payment to us equal to the volume or amount of the shortfall multiplied or increased by the applicable fee, subject to certain exceptions as specified in the applicable agreement. Carry-over of any volumes or revenue in excess of such commitment to any subsequent quarter is not permitted. 
The tariffs and throughput and storage fees under our agreements with Delek Holdings are subject to increase or decrease on July 1 of each year, by the amount of any change in various inflation-based indices, including the FERC oil pipeline index or various iterations of the consumer price index and the producer price index; provided, however, that in no event will the fees be adjusted below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement. 
See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek Holdings. 
Other Agreements with Delek Holdings 
In addition to the commercial agreements described above, the Partnership has entered into an omnibus agreement with Delek Holdings, our general partner, Delek Logistics Operating LLC ("OpCo") and certain of the Partnership’s and Delek Holdings’ other subsidiaries on November 7, 2012, which was subsequently amended and restated on July 26, 2013, February 10, 2014 and March 31, 2015 and further amended on August 3, 2015 (collectively, as amended, the "Omnibus Agreement"). The Omnibus Agreement governs the provision of certain operational services and reimbursement obligations, among other matters, between the Partnership and Delek Holdings. 
The Partnership is currently managing a long-term capital project on behalf of Delek Holdings pursuant to a construction management and operating services agreement (the "DPG Management Agreement") for the construction of a 250-mile gathering system in the Permian Basin (the "Delek Permian Gathering Project"). The Partnership is also considered the operator for the project and will oversee functions such as oversight of project design, procurement and construction of project segments and provide other related services. The agreement extends through December 2022. 
Other Agreements with Third Parties 
Paline Pipeline System Capacity Reservation 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had separate agreements with an unrelated third party and a related party for such parties to utilize certain capacity on the Paline Pipeline System. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, each party paid a fixed monthly fee for the right to use its respective capacity on the pipeline, which together accounted for a combined 30,000 bpd. The initial term of each agreement ran through February 2019. We do not anticipate that these agreements will be extended. As a result, on March 1, 2019, the capacity previously used by these parties will be available for any party to ship on the capacity of the pipeline subject to a tariff on file with the FERC for service provided on the Paline Pipeline System. 
West Texas 
In our west Texas marketing operations, we generate revenue by purchasing refined products from independent third-party suppliers and Delek Holdings for sale and exchange to third parties at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals and at third-party terminals located elsewhere in Texas. Substantially all of our product sales in west Texas are on a wholesale basis. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a large portion of the refined products we sold in west Texas were purchased from Noble Petro. Under the terms of the Abilene Contract with Noble Petro, which expired in December 2017, we purchased refined products based on monthly average prices from Noble Petro immediately prior to our resale of such products to customers at our Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals, which we leased to Noble Petro. Under this arrangement, we had limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating prices for these refined products due to the short period of time between the purchase and resale of these refined products. As of January 2018, we began replacing the product supplied under the Abilene Contract with product purchased from Delek Holdings, which is produced by the Big Spring Refinery and from third parties that may continue to include Noble Petro. Products purchased from Delek Holdings are generally based on daily market prices at the time of sale limiting exposure to fluctuating prices. Products purchased from third parties are generally based on daily market prices at the time of purchase requiring price hedging risk management activities between the time of purchase and sale. Existing price risk hedging programs have been adjusted to correspond to the volume of product purchased from third parties.

Delek Holdings' Crude Oil and Refined Products Supply and Offtake Arrangement 
Pursuant to an arrangement with Delek Holdings and Lion Oil, to which we are not a party, J. Aron & Company ("J. Aron") acquires and holds either title to or a lien on substantially all crude oil, intermediate and refined products transported on our Lion Pipeline System, SALA Gathering System and on pipeline capacity we lease from Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company LLC on a pipeline that runs from the El Dorado Refinery to our Memphis Terminal (the "Memphis Pipeline"). J. Aron is therefore considered the shipper for the liquid it owns on the Lion Pipeline System, the SALA Gathering System and the Memphis Pipeline. J. Aron also has title to the refined products stored at our Memphis, North Little Rock and El Dorado terminals and in the El Dorado storage tanks. Under (i) our pipelines and storage agreement with Lion Oil relating to the Lion Pipeline System and the SALA Gathering System, (ii) our terminalling agreements with Lion Oil relating to the Memphis and North Little Rock terminals, and (iii) our throughput and tankage agreement relating to the terminal and tank assets at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery, Lion Oil has assigned to J. Aron certain of its rights under these agreements, including the right to have J. Aron's crude oil and intermediate and refined products stored in or transported on or through these systems, the Memphis and North Little Rock terminals and the terminal and tank assets at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery, with Lion Oil acting as J. Aron's agent for scheduling purposes. 
Pursuant to a similar arrangement with Delek Holdings and Alon USA, LP, hereinafter referred to as "Big Spring Refining," J. Aron acquires and holds either title to or a lien on a portion of the crude oil, intermediate and refined products shipped on pipelines or stored at the terminal and storage tanks acquired in the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition. Under (i) our pipelines, storage and throughput facilities agreement with Big Spring Refining relating to certain storage tanks, pipelines and a terminal in Duncan, Oklahoma and (ii) our asphalt services agreement with Big Spring Refining relating to asphalt storage and terminalling near the Big Spring Refinery, Big Spring Refining has assigned to J. Aron certain of its rights under these agreements, including the right to have J. Aron's crude oil and intermediate and refined products stored in or transported on or through these storage and terminalling assets at or adjacent to the Big Spring Refinery, with Big Spring Refining acting as J. Aron's agent for scheduling purposes. 
Accordingly, even though this activity is effectively a financing arrangement for Delek Holdings and its subsidiaries whereby J. Aron sells the product back to Delek Holdings and its subsidiaries, J. Aron is technically our primary customer under each of these agreements. J. Aron retains these storage and transportation rights for the term of its arrangement with Lion Oil, which currently runs through April 30, 2020, and for the term of its arrangement with Big Spring Refining, which currently runs through May 31, 2021, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the arrangement. J. Aron pays us for the transportation, throughput and storage services we provide to it. The rights assigned to J. Aron do not alter the obligations of Lion Oil or Big Spring Refining to meet certain throughput minimum volumes under our agreements with respect to the transportation, throughputting and storage of crude oil and refined products through our facilities, but J. Aron's throughput is credited toward the minimum throughput commitments of Lion Oil and Big Spring. Accordingly, Lion Oil and Big Spring are responsible for making any shortfall payments incurred under the pipelines and storage agreement or the terminalling agreement which may result from minimum throughputs or volumes not being met. 
Major Customers
We are dependent upon Delek Holdings as our primary customer (which includes sales to J. Aron as described in the prior section), and the loss of Delek Holdings as a customer would have a material adverse effect on both of our operating segments. We derive a substantial majority of our contribution margin, which is defined as net revenues less cost of materials and other and operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, from fee-based commercial agreements with Delek Holdings or as a direct result of its operations. Delek Holdings, directly or indirectly, accounted for 83%, 87% and 92% of our contribution margin under our commercial agreements with Delek for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For more information pertaining to these agreements, please see "Commercial Agreements." We also have other customers, including major oil companies, independent refiners and marketers, jobbers, distributors, utility and transportation companies and independent retail fuel operators.
Delek Holdings, directly or indirectly, accounted for 36.6%, 28.9% and 32.8% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sunoco LP accounted for 15.9%, 9.0% and 10.5% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Employees
We have no employees. Rather, all of the employees that conduct our business are employed by our general partner and its non-Partnership affiliates, and we believe that our general partner and its non-Partnership affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees.

Seasonality and Customer Maintenance Programs
The volume and throughput of crude oil and refined products transported through our pipelines and sold through our terminals and to third parties are directly affected by the level of supply and demand for all of such products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Supply and demand for such products fluctuates during the calendar year. Demand for gasoline, for example, is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in motor vehicle traffic. While demand for asphalt products, which are a substantial portion of the El Dorado Refinery's product mix, is also lower in the winter months. In addition, our refining customers, such as Delek Holdings, occasionally reduce or suspend operations to perform planned maintenance, which is more typically scheduled during the winter, when demand for their products is lower. Accordingly, these factors affect the need for crude oil or refined products by our customers and therefore limit our volumes or throughput during these periods, and our operating results will generally be lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year. We believe, however, that many of the potential effects of seasonality on our revenues and contribution margin will be substantially mitigated due to our commercial agreements with Delek Holdings that include minimum volume and throughput commitments.

Business

Working Capital
We primarily fund our business operations from operating cash flows, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and any potential future issuances of equity and debt securities. For additional information, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
Pipelines and Transportation 
Our business in this segment primarily consists of gathering, transporting and storing crude oil, intermediate and refined products for Delek Holdings and third parties, especially other refiners. We face competition for the transportation and storage of crude oil from other pipeline owners whose pipelines or storage facilities (i) may have a location advantage over our pipelines or storage facilities, (ii) may be able to transport or store more desirable crude oil or refined products to Delek Holdings or to third parties, (iii) may be able to transport or store crude oil or refined product at a lower rate, or (iv) may be able to store more crude oil or refined product. Any or all such factors could cause Delek Holdings, or our third-party customers, to reduce throughput to a level that is below the minimum throughput commitments established in any contracts we may have with them or determine not to renew such contracts when the term expires. 
As a result of our physical integration with Delek Holdings' El Dorado Refinery, and our contractual relationships with Delek Holdings relative to the El Dorado Refinery, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for the transportation of crude oil or refined products to or from the El Dorado Refinery, particularly during the term of our Lion Pipeline System, SALA Gathering System, El Dorado Tank Assets and El Dorado Assets agreements with Delek Holdings. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of our material commercial agreements with Delek Holdings.
Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling 
The wholesale marketing and terminalling business is generally very competitive. Our owned refined product terminals, as well as the other third-party terminals we use to sell refined product, compete with other independent terminal operators as well as integrated oil companies on the basis of terminal location, price, versatility and services provided. The costs associated with transporting products from a loading terminal to end users usually limit the geographic size of the market that can be served economically by any terminal. Two key markets in west Texas that we serve from our owned facilities are Abilene and San Angelo, Texas. However, there are no competitive fuel loading terminals in close proximity to our Abilene terminal or within approximately 90 miles of our San Angelo terminal. Our Nashville terminal competes with a significant number of other terminals located in the greater Nashville area. With respect to terminalling services we provide to Delek Holdings at our Memphis and North Little Rock terminals, as a result of our exclusive terminalling agreements, we do not believe we will face significant competition from third parties for these services. 
Pursuant to separate exclusive marketing agreements with Delek Holdings, we market 100% of the refined products output of the Tyler Refinery (other than jet fuel and petroleum coke) and certain refined products at or sold from the Big Spring Refinery to various customers in return for a marketing fee. The current terms of the agreements for services provided with respect to products produced at the Tyler Refinery and the Big Spring Refinery expire in 2026 and 2028, respectively. As a result, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for these services from third parties. In addition, as a result of our physical integration with the Tyler Refinery and the Big Spring Refinery, and our contractual relationships with Delek Holdings relative to both refineries, we do not believe that we will face significant competition for the storage or throughput of intermediate or refined products at the refineries, particularly during the term of our agreements with Delek Holdings. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information. Should Delek Holdings' wholesale customers, however, reduce their purchases of refined products due to the increased availability of more competitively priced products from other suppliers or for other reasons, the volumes we sell under the aforementioned agreement could decrease below the minimum volume commitment under the contract. Delek Holdings' Tyler Refinery and Big Spring Refinery are the only full-range product supplier within 100 miles; therefore, we believe their location gives the refineries a natural advantage over more distant competitors. 
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Rate Regulation of Petroleum Pipelines
The rates and terms and conditions of service on certain of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the ICA and by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we transport crude oil, intermediate and refined products, including the Texas Railroad Commission, the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the Arkansas Public Service Commission. The FERC regulates interstate transportation under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including pipelines that transport crude oil, intermediate and refined products in interstate commerce (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”), be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the FERC. Under the ICA, shippers may challenge new or existing rates or services. The FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a challenged rate for up to seven months, though rates are typically not suspended for the maximum allowable period. Tariff rates are typically contractually subject to increase or decrease on July 1 of each year, by the amount of any change in various inflation-based indices, including the FERC oil pipeline index, the consumer price index and the producer price index; provided, however, that in 
 15

Business

no event will the fees be adjusted below the amount initially set forth in the applicable agreement. In addition, on October 20, 2016, the FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Revisions to Indexing Policies and Page 700 of FERC Form No. 6, which could, if final rules are implemented as proposed, increase reporting burdens on interstate liquids transportation providers and, in some cases, prohibit pipelines, including ours, from increasing rates even if warranted by the annual index. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business."
While the FERC regulates rates for shipments of crude oil or refined products in interstate commerce, state agencies may regulate rates and service for shipments in intrastate commerce. We own pipeline assets in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana; accordingly, such assets may be subject to additional regulation by the applicable governmental authorities in those states. Without limitation, certain of our pipeline assets in Texas are operated under Texas Railroad Commission regulation and subject to filed tariffs with that agency. The Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is such a pipeline. In Texas, a pipeline, with some exceptions, is required to operate as a common carrier by publishing tariffs and providing transportation without discrimination. Arkansas provides that all intrastate oil pipelines are common carriers. In Louisiana, all pipelines conveying petroleum from a point of origin within the state to a destination within the state are declared common carriers. The Louisiana Public Service Commission is empowered with the authority to establish reasonable rates and regulations for the transport of petroleum by a common carrier, mandating public tariffs and providing of transportation without discrimination. State commissions have generally not been aggressive in regulating common carrier pipelines, have generally not investigated the rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints and generally resolve shipper complaints informally. 
Whether a pipeline provides service in interstate commerce or intrastate commerce is highly fact-dependent and determined on a case-by-case basis. We cannot provide assurance that the FERC will not at some point assert that some or all of the transportation service we provide, for which we do not have a tariff on file at the FERC, is within its jurisdiction. If the FERC were successful with any such assertion, we may be required to pay refunds to customers and the FERC's ratemaking methodologies may subject us to potentially burdensome and expensive operational, reporting and other requirements. Service on the East Texas Crude Logistics System is currently subject to a temporary waiver issued by the FERC. The East Texas Waiver Order (as defined below) was issued by the FERC on October 23, 2012, and waives the otherwise applicable tariff filing and reporting requirements for common carrier interstate service providers (the “East Texas Waiver Order”). The continuing effectiveness of the East Texas Waiver Order depends upon the continuation in effect of the following conditions: (1) our affiliates continuing to own 100% of the throughput; (2) there being no demonstrated third party interest in shipping on the system; (3) our not anticipating any such interest materializing; and (4) there remaining no demonstrated opposition to the continuing effectiveness of the East Texas Waiver Order.
 If the conditions to the continued effectiveness of that East Texas Waiver Order are no longer true at any point, service on that system would become fully subject to FERC tariff filing requirements and other regulatory requirements for the provision of transportation service.
Department of Transportation 
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") of the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") regulates the design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, reporting and emergency response of crude oil, petroleum products and other hazardous liquids pipelines and other facilities, including certain tank facilities used in the transportation of such liquids. These requirements are complex, subject to change and, in certain cases, can be costly to comply with. We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations, but cannot assure you that substantial expenditures on our part will not be required to remain in compliance. Moreover, certain of these rules are difficult to insure adequately, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to address costs and damages from any noncompliance. 
The United States Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (or the "Pipeline Safety Act") was enacted on January 3, 2012, pursuant to which the maximum civil penalties for certain violations were increased from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day and from a total cap of $1 million to $2 million. A number of the provisions of the Pipeline Safety Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. We intend to work closely with our industry associations to participate with and monitor DOT-PHMSA's efforts. 
In January 2017, PHMSA finalized a new regulation that imposes additional responsibilities concerning the operation, maintenance, and inspection of hazardous liquid pipelines; the reporting of pipeline incidents; reference standards for in-line pipeline inspection and the direct assessment of stress corrosion cracking; and other requirements. Additional potential new regulations of pipelines have been proposed by PHMSA and we are monitoring these developments to the extent applicable to our operations. 
The DOT has issued guidelines with respect to securing regulated facilities against terrorist attack. We have instituted security measures and procedures in accordance with such guidelines to enhance the protection of certain of our facilities. We cannot provide any assurance that these security measures would fully protect our facilities from an attack.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the DOT regulates safety standards and monitors drivers and equipment of commercial motor carrier fleets. Such standards include vehicle and maintenance inspection requirements, limitations on the number of hours drivers may operate vehicles and financial responsibility requirements. We believe that the operations of our fleet of crude oil and refined products truck transports are substantially in compliance with these regulations and safety requirements.

Business

Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations enforced by various agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), the United States Department of Transportation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as numerous state, regional and local environmental, safety and pipeline agencies. These laws and regulations govern the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management practices, pollution prevention measures, as well as the safe operation of our pipelines and the safety of our workers and the public. Numerous permits or other authorizations are required under these laws and regulations for the operation of our terminals, pipelines, saltwells, trucks, and related operations, and may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal. These laws and permits raise potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental and safety matters which could include soil and water contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we handled, used, released or disposed of, transported, or that relate to pre-existing conditions for which we have assumed responsibility. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with existing environmental and safety requirements. However, there have been and we expect that there will continue to be ongoing discussions about environmental and safety matters between us and federal and state authorities, including notices of violations, citations and other enforcement actions, some of which have resulted or may result in changes to operating procedures and in capital expenditures. While it is often difficult to quantify future environmental or safety related expenditures, we anticipate that continuing capital investments and changes in operating procedures will be required to comply with existing and new requirements, as well as evolving interpretations and more strict enforcement of existing laws and regulations. 
Releases of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, or is not a reimbursable event under the Omnibus Agreement, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to respond to, contain and remediate a release, to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury, property damage or natural resources damages. See "Hazardous Substances and Waste" below for additional information on regulations pertaining to releases into the environment. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts. There have been and will continue to be ongoing discussions about environmental and safety matters between us and federal and state authorities, including notices of violations, citations and other enforcement actions, some of which have resulted or may result in changes to operating procedures and in capital expenditures. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of commitments and contingencies related to crude oil releases.
Indemnification
Under the Omnibus Agreement, Delek Holdings has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental matters associated with the ownership of our assets as specified therein, including matters arising from operations by Delek Holdings, at or before the time of our acquisition of these assets from Delek Holdings. 
Air Emissions and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and its regulations and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. These permits may require controls on our air emission sources, and we may become subject to more stringent regulations requiring the installation of additional emission control technologies. Any such future obligations may require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs. These air emissions requirements also affect Delek Holdings' refineries, from which we receive a substantial portion of our revenues. In the future, Delek Holdings may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to comply with new legislative and regulatory requirements relating to its operations. To the extent these capital expenditures have a material effect on Delek Holdings, they could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.    
Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") and their potential role in climate change. Developments in GHG initiatives that result in GHG-related requirements that disproportionately affect the cost of energy from oil in comparison to competing energy sources could affect demand for our services. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the risks and regulatory framework associated with greenhouse gas emissions, the financial impact of related developments cannot be estimated at this time.
Renewable Fuel Standard 
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ("EISA") was enacted into federal law in December 2007 creating the Renewable Fuel Standard - 2 ("RFS-2") rule, requiring the amounts of renewable fuel sold or introduced in the United States to increase each year, reaching 36 billion gallons by 2022. Meeting RFS-2 requires displacing increasing amounts of petroleum-based transportation fuels with biofuels, beginning with approximately 7.8% in 2011, 10.1% in 2016, 10.7% in 2017 and 2018, and 10.97% in 2019. Although Delek Holdings’ refineries are obligated parties under this rule, our entities are not obligated parties and have no requirement to blend specific volumes of renewable fuels. However, the requirements could reduce future demand for petroleum products and thereby have an indirect effect on certain aspects of our business, although it could increase demand for our ethanol and biodiesel fuel blending services at our truck loading racks.

Business

Hazardous Substances and Waste 
To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into water or soils, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), which is also known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance” and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up certain sites. However, we have not been identified as a potentially responsible party at any Superfund sites.
We also generate small quantities of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and comparable state laws. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including crude oil and refined products wastes. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements, because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.” Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. Any changes in the regulations could increase our, and our competitors’, maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
We currently own and lease, and Delek Holdings has in the past owned and leased, properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. 
Water
Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products. Several of our pipelines and terminals are located near, or cross under or over, environmentally sensitive waters, such as streams, creeks, rivers, lakes and wetlands. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA"), the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the "Clean Water Act") and related state requirements. These requirements subject owners of covered facilities to strict, joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages and certain other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us. States in which we operate have also enacted similar and, in some cases, more stringent laws. 
Regulations under the Clean Water Act, the OPA and state laws also impose additional regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or leak. For example, the Clean Water Act requires us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans at many of our facilities. In addition, the OPA requires that most oil transport and storage companies maintain and update various oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. We maintain such plans, and where required have submitted plans and received federal and state approvals necessary to comply with the OPA, the Clean Water Act and related regulations. We regularly review and modify our crude oil and refined product spill prevention plans and procedures to help prevent crude oil and refined product releases and to minimize potential impacts should a release occur. 
The Clean Water Act also imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Our facilities contract with third parties for wastewater disposal, discharge to local Publicly Owned Treatment Works, or discharge under the terms of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for wastewater and stormwater. In the event regulatory requirements change, or interpretations of current requirements change, and our facilities are required to undertake different wastewater management arrangements, we could incur substantial additional costs. The Clean Water Act imposes substantial potential liability for the violation of permits or permitting requirements and for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages resulting from such discharges. In addition, some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions.
