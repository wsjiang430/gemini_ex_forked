 Company Overview 
     Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Adamis” or the “company”) is a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products in the therapeutic areas of respiratory disease and allergy. Our products and product candidates in the allergy, respiratory, opioid overdose and erectile dysfunction or ED markets include: Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2017 for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis; Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg which was approved by the FDA in September 2018, for use in the treatment of anaphylaxis for patients weighing 33-65 pounds; a naloxone injection product candidate (APC-6000) based on the approved Symject™ injection device and intended for the treatment of opioid overdose for which the company submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, in December 2018 which was accepted for review by the FDA in March 2019; a fast-disintegrating sublingual tablet containing tadalafil (APC-8000), a drug used for treating ED, for which the company submitted an NDA for ED in December 2018 which was the subject of a refusal to file letter from the FDA in February 2019; a Beclomethasone metered dose inhaler product candidate (APC-1000) intended for the treatment of asthma for which the company submitted an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, in January 2018 and has initiated the start-up phase of  Phase 3 studies; and a fluticasone (APC-4000) dry powder inhaler, or DPI, product candidate for the treatment of asthma. Our goal is to create low cost therapeutic alternatives to existing treatments. Consistent across all specialty pharmaceuticals product lines, we intend to submit NDAs under Section 505(b)(2), of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA, or Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the FDA, whenever possible, in order to potentially reduce the time to market and to save on costs, compared to those associated with Section 505(b)(1) NDAs for new drug products.
      Our U.S. Compounding, Inc., subsidiary, or USC, which we acquired in April 2016 and which is registered as a drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the FDCA and the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, provides prescription compounded medications, including compounded sterile preparations and nonsterile compounds, to patients, physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States. USC’s product offerings broadly include, among others, corticosteroids, hormone replacement therapies, hospital outsourcing products, injectables, urological preparations, topical compounds for pain and men’s and women’s health products. USC’s compounded formulations in many circumstances are offered as alternatives to drugs approved by the FDA. USC also provides certain veterinary pharmaceutical products for animals.
      To achieve our goals and support our overall strategy, we may need to raise a substantial amount of funding and make significant investments in, among other things, new product development and working capital.
     The current status of our development programs is as follows:
     Product Portfolio

(2) | Represents the next anticipated development or regulatory stage for the product candidate that we may pursue following completion of product development, assuming that we have the financial resources to pursue any of these opportunities. There are no assurances that we will pursue these opportunities, for financial or other reasons. Following completion of product development, one or more Phase 3 trials, without previous Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials, is the anticipated next product development stage. We intend to conduct additional trials, such as pharmacokinetic, or PK, and/or dose escalation studies in connection with the Phase 3 trials.

 Anaphylaxis; Epinephrine Pre-Filled Syringe 
     On June 15, 2017, the FDA approved the company’s Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg product for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis in patients weighing 66 pounds and greater. Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg is intended to deliver a dose of epinephrine, which is used for emergency, immediate administration in acute anaphylactic reactions to insect stings or bites, allergic reaction to certain foods, drugs and other allergens, as well as idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis.
        1 
 

 On September 27, 2018, FDA approved our lower dose version (0.15mg) of Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection, for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis in patients weighing 33 to 66 pounds. 
      The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, or AAAAI, defines anaphylaxis as a serious life-threatening allergic reaction. The most common anaphylactic reactions are to foods, insect stings, medications and latex. According to information published by AAAAI reporting on findings from a 2009-2010 study, up to 8% of U.S. children under the age of 18 had a food allergy, and approximately 38% of those with a food allergy had a history of severe reactions. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical treatment, including an injection of epinephrine.
     We estimate that sales of prescription epinephrine products in 2018 were more than $1.5 billion, based on assumptions and estimates utilizing industry data. We cannot provide any assurances concerning any possible future rates of annual growth or whether annual prescription sales will decline or grow. As discussed elsewhere in this Report, including under the headings “Business – Competition” and “Risk Factors - If our potential products are unable to compete effectively with current and future products targeting similar markets as our potential products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated,” the market for prescription epinephrine products is increasingly competitive, and a number of factors have resulted in, and could continue to result in, downward pressure on the pricing of, and revenues from sales of, prescription epinephrine products such as our Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and lower dose version 0.15mg product.
     Our Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg product will allow users to administer a pre-measured epinephrine dose quickly with a device that we believe, based on human factors studies, to be intuitive to use. If the person using the auto-injector is not familiar with the function of the device and if not administered properly, there is a risk that it could misfire or be misused.    In July 2018, we entered into a Distribution and Commercialization Agreement with Sandoz Inc., a division of Novartis AG, to commercialize our Symjepi™ product. Under the terms of the agreement, we appointed Sandoz as the exclusive distributor of Symjepi in the United States and related territories, or the Territory, in all fields including both the retail market and other markets, and granted Sandoz an exclusive license under our patent and other intellectual property rights and know-how to market, sell, and otherwise commercialize and distribute the product in the Territory, subject to the provisions of the agreement, in partial consideration of an upfront fee by Sandoz and potential performance-based milestone payments. As part of the agreement, Sandoz has commercial rights to our Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3 mg product, as well as the lower dose Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg product. We retain rights to the intellectual property subject to the agreement and to commercialize both products outside of the Territory, but have granted Sandoz a right of first negotiation regarding such territories. In addition, we may continue to use the licensed intellectual property (excluding certain of the licensed trademarks) to develop and commercialize other products (with certain exceptions), including products that utilize our Symject™ syringe product platform.
 The agreement provides that Sandoz will pay to us 50% of the Net Profit from Net Sales, as each such term is defined in the agreement, of the product in the Territory to third parties, determined on a quarterly basis. We will be the supplier of the product to Sandoz, and Sandoz will order and pay us a supply price for quantities of products ordered. We will be responsible for all manufacturing and, prior to Sandoz paying the supply price, the component and supply costs related to manufacturing and supplying the product to Sandoz. We are responsible for component sourcing and regulatory compliance in the supply chain and for testing of lots of product.
 
Sandoz has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the product, subject to various conditions and to the other provisions of the agreement. The agreement does not include minimum payments to us by Sandoz, minimum requirements for sales of product by Sandoz or, with certain exceptions, minimum purchase commitments by Sandoz. Under the agreement, Sandoz has sole discretion in determining pricing, terms of sale, marketing, and selling decisions relating to the product.
  On January 16, 2019, we announced that Sandoz had launched Symjepi™ (epinephrine) 0.3 mg Injection in the U.S. market. Symjepi™ will be rolled out via a phased launch and will initially be available in the institutional setting, an established channel where Sandoz has a significant experience and knowledge, followed by anticipated introduction into the retail market. We also anticipate that Sandoz will launch the lower dose Symjepi™ 0.15 mg Injection product in the U.S. markets.

 Opioid Overdose
     Naloxone Injection (APC-6000)
     Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to treat narcotic overdoses. Naloxone, which is generally considered the drug of choice for immediate administration for opioid overdose, blocks or reverses the effects of the opioid, including extreme drowsiness, slowed breathing, or loss of consciousness. Common opioids include morphine, heroin, tramadol, oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl.
    The number of deaths due to opioids has increased over five-fold compared to 1999. According to statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2017 drug overdoses resulted in approximately 70,000 deaths in the United States – greater than approximately 190 deaths per day. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50, and the proliferation of more powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and its analogues, could result in future increases in the number of deaths resulting from opioid overdoses. Recent studies have revealed an 87% increase in deaths associated with synthetic opioids, whereas, death rates due to natural and semisynthetic opioids remained relatively stable. With this significant increase in synthetic opioid abuse are published studies that have suggested that the current recommended doses of naloxone may be inadequate in that frequent redosing is required. Repeat dosing of the commonly utilized dose of naloxone suggests the need for a higher dosage product.
 
As we have previously disclosed, in December 2017 we submitted an IND to the FDA to begin testing of the drug compound naloxone in human patients. Testing in humans, which included a pharmacokinetic study, began in April 2018. On December 31, 2018, we filed an NDA with the FDA relating to our APC-6000 product which provides a higher dose of naloxone than all products currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of opioid overdose. On March 14, 2019, we announced that the FDA had accepted the submitted NDA for review and indicated that it had completed its filing review and had determined that the NDA was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.  The FDA further provided a target agency action date of October 31, 2019. However, the FDA’s review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to the timing of the FDA’s review process, FDA requests for additional data, information, materials or clarification, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, FDA workload issues, extensions resulting from the submission of additional information or clarification regarding information already in the submission within the last three months of the target PDUFA date, or other reasons. As a result, the dates of regulatory approval, if obtained, and commercial introduction of our product could be delayed beyond our expectations. The development of an intramuscular injection of naloxone for the treatment of opioid overdose will require commercial scale manufacturing subject to review and approval by the FDA.
 
Tadalafil (APC-8000)
 
Tadalafil (Cialis®) is in a class of drugs called phosphodiesterase-5, or PDE5, inhibitors which includes, among others, sildenafil (Viagra®) and vardenafil (Levitra®). All of these oral tablets are FDA approved and clinically indicated for the treatment of ED. Tadalafil and sildenafil are also indicated for pulmonary hypertension, but among PDE5 drugs, only tadalafil is approved for the treatment of BPH. We estimate that annual sales of Cialis in the United States in 2018 were approximately $2.5 billion, based on publicly available information.
 
On December 28, 2018, we filed an NDA for fast-disintegrating sublingual version of tadalafil (APC-8000) with the FDA. On February 26, 2019, we received a refusal to file letter from the FDA, indicating that upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the submitted NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.  The FDA requested that we supplement and include in any resubmitted NDA (i) longer real-time (versus accelerated) stability data and (ii) additional dissolution data for both the clinical and registration batches. The agency indicated that it would refund 75% of the total user fee that we submitted with the NDA. We continue to evaluate the FDA’s comments, and we may seek immediate guidance from the FDA, including requesting a Type A meeting, to discuss the letter with the agency and seek additional guidance concerning information, data and specific deliverables that the agency would require for a resubmitted NDA to be deemed complete. We cannot provide any assurances concerning the amount of time or costs that may be associated with the activities and data that may be required to enable a resubmission of the NDA. If Adamis resubmits the NDA, there can be no assurances concerning the acceptance of the NDA, the review time by FDA or the FDA’s response to any resubmitted NDA. 
  Asthma and Bronchospasm
 
According to the National Institute of Health, or NIH, asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. According to information published by Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) reporting on findings from 2016, the number of people in the U.S. with asthma is approximately 26.5 million and growing. We estimate that global sales of asthma and bronchospasm prescription products were in excess of approximately $8.1 billion in 2018, based on industry data.     Asthma; APC-1000 Metered Dose Inhaler
     Our APC-1000 product candidate is a steroid hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, metered dose inhaler product, intended for the treatment of asthma. Our product candidate, if developed and approved for marketing, will target a small niche within the larger market for respiratory products. We estimate that the annual global sales of prescription steroid HFA and similar products were approximately $2.7 billion in 2018, of which we intend to target a smaller niche.     In February 2015, we announced the result of our pharmacokinetic study, or PK study, comparing our beclomethasone dipropionate HFA, 80 mcg Inhalation Aerosol, product, APC-1000, with Teva Respiratory, LLC’s Qvar® (Beclomethasone Dipropionate HFA, 80 mcg Inhalation Aerosol) product. The study was a Phase I open label, randomized, single-dose, four-way crossover PK study comparing APC-1000 to Qvar. Twenty-two healthy male and female subjects who met the study inclusion criteria were enrolled. The study involved a screening period before randomization and four treatment periods each separated by a minimum of three days. Both inhalation aerosols were administered to each subject for a total dose of 320 mcg BDP (4 inhalations). Twenty-one subjects completed the study. One subject was withdrawn due to non-compliance. The purpose of this PK study was to compare the bioavailability of APC-1000 to Qvar.  The results showed the extent of absorption of APC-1000 to be equivalent to Qvar. Following discussions with the FDA and additional consideration of the development pathway for the product, we decided to conduct additional development work for APC-1000.
 
In January 2018, we submitted an IND application to the FDA to begin Phase 3 efficacy studies for APC-1000. We received approval from the agency to proceed with the Phase 3 studies, and in December 2018, we initiated the start-up phase of the phase 3 studies of APC-1000. We anticipate that trial enrollment will commence in 2019. The timing of enrollment and completion of such studies could be affected by a number of factors, including without limitation adequate funding, the absence of unexpected regulatory issues or delays, the time period required to enroll a sufficient number of patients in the study, and the time required to complete and analyze the results of the studies. As discussed elsewhere in this Report, product development times are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which can delay the actual development time beyond our estimates.

 Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Device Platform
     In December 2013, we acquired assets relating to 3M’s patented Taper dry powder inhaler (DPI) technology under development by 3M for the treatment of asthma and bronchospasm. The Taper DPI technology was designed to efficiently deliver dry powder by utilizing a 3M proprietary microstructured carrier tape. We are utilizing the Taper DPI assets to develop the DPI device. We believe that, if successfully developed, the device can be utilized to deliver a variety of different drug compounds and be used as a platform delivery device to develop products that will compete in the respiratory markets, which may include combination products. Our agreement with 3M contemplates that the microstructured carrier tape will be supplied by 3M under a separate commercial supply agreement to be negotiated with 3M.
 
We believe that one advantage of the technology is that it can deliver drug particles without the need for lactose or formulation excipients. The majority of current dry powder products use lactose carrier excipients to enhance flowability; however, they have the disadvantage of increased bulk and require a mechanism for detaching the drug from the surface of the lactose. Lactose carrier formulations require a complicated blending process and delivery that is highly sensitive to excipient powder properties. To our knowledge, there are currently no excipient-free dry powder inhalers in the U.S. market. We are continuing product development efforts concerning this platform delivery device and product candidates utilizing the device.
 
Asthma; Fluticasone. Our first product candidate utilizing the DPI technology platform, APC-4000, will deliver Fluticasone Propionate (fluticasone) as a dry powder formulation for the treatment of asthma. Fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids. It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms. APC-4000 is designed to deliver the same active ingredient as GlaxoSmithKline’s Flovent® Diskus® for the treatment of asthma. We estimate that Flovent® Diskus® generated more than $443 million in U.S. sales and $791 million in global sales in 2018, based on GSK’s publicly announced results. We conducted a proof of concept study with the DPI for APC-4000 in 2018. Assuming sufficient funding and successful development, we may conduct one or more additional proof of concept studies for APC-4000 during 2019.
  We currently have no in-house manufacturing capabilities, and as a result we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture the materials needed to produce DPI and HFA products.     Our development plans concerning our allergy and respiratory products, including APC-1000 and APC-4000, and our other product candidates are affected by developments in the marketplace, including the introduction of potentially competing new products by our competitors. As a result, our product development plans could be affected by such considerations. The anticipated dates for development and introduction of products in our product pipeline will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of adequate funding to support product development efforts and, should we choose to seek commercialization partners for one or more of our products or product candidates, our success in negotiating and entering into development or commercialization agreements relating to our products. We believe that should we decide to pursue such applications, we would be required to submit data for an application for approval to market APC-1000 and APC-4000 pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, although there are no assurances that this will be the case.  In considering development and commercialization alternatives for our products and product candidates and technologies, we may seek to enter into development or commercialization agreements, license agreements, or other strategic agreements with third parties relating to development, commercialization and marketing of one or more of our products or product candidates.
 Factors that could affect the development and launch dates for our products and product candidates include general market conditions, the outcome of discussions with the FDA concerning the regulatory approval pathway of the applicable product candidate including the number and kind of clinical trials that the FDA will require before the FDA will consider regulatory approval of the applicable product, any unexpected difficulties in licensing or sublicensing intellectual property rights that may be required for other components of the product, patent infringement lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV certifications as part of any Section 505(b)(2) or ANDA filings, see “Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications,” any unexpected difficulties in the ability of our suppliers to timely supply quantities for commercial launch of the product, any unexpected delays or difficulties in assembling and deploying an adequate sales force to market the product, and receipt of adequate funding to support product development and sales and marketing efforts.

 Prescription Compounded Medications 
     Overview. Our USC subsidiary, which is registered as a drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the FDCA and the DQSA, provides prescription compounded medications, including compounded sterile preparations or CSPs, and non-sterile compounds to patients, physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States. USC’s product offerings broadly include, among others, corticosteroids, hormone replacement therapies, hospital outsourcing products, injectables, urological preparations, topical compounds for pain and men’s and women’s health products. USC’s compounded formulations in many circumstances are offered as therapeutic alternatives to drugs approved by the FDA. USC also provides certain veterinary pharmaceutical products for animals.
     USC sources raw materials and commercial products only from suppliers registered with the FDA. Utilizing these raw material components, USC prepares and provides a broad range of customized stock keeping units to meet the individual requirements of customers located throughout most of the United States.
     The pharmacy sterile compounding industry arose in part because hospitals and other healthcare providers administering drugs require concentrations, dosage forms and delivery systems that are not readily commercially available from drug manufacturers in a ready-to-use, or RTU, form. Historically, safety and quality standards for compounded medications were not well defined or implemented, leading to demand for safer compounding practices, and the level of state regulation varied significantly. The 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak caused by a compounding pharmacy led to increased regulatory oversight of the industry which, among other things, led to the passage of the DQSA and its creation of Section 503B outsourcing facilities as a new, more highly FDA-regulated category of interstate outsourced CSP providers. Registration as a Section 503B outsourcing facility is currently voluntary. USC was incorporated in Arkansas in 2004, and registered with the FDA as a Section 503B outsourcing facility in December 2013.
     USC’s business is focused on marketing a portfolio of compounded preparations for humans and animals, including sterile injectable and non-sterile integrative therapies, in therapeutic areas such as autoimmunity, chronic infectious diseases, and endocrine and metabolic diseases. Many of these formulations are offered in different formats than other available alternatives, such as in suspension or preservative free. Many hospitals and surgery centers look to outsourcing facilities to obtain medications in ready-to-use, or RTU, format, with the specific packaging, volume, and strength often unique to individual facilities. Many facilities and practitioners also look to outsourcing facilities when medications are on temporary backorder from the manufacturer or are discontinued. USC’s veterinary products include, without limitation, a formulation that we believe is novel, of an equine ulcer product that addresses what we believe is a significant market.
     Compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities combine different ingredients, some of which may be FDA-approved drugs or components of FDA-approved drugs, to create specialized preparations prescribed by a physician. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions, or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. A physician may also work together with a pharmacist to repurpose or reformulate FDA-approved drugs via the compounding process to meet a patient’s specific medical needs. These compounds are distributed to hospitals, surgery centers, and practitioners. Examples of compounded medications prepared by outsourcing facilities include sterile syringes used by hospital and surgery center operating rooms, sterile injectables administered by the practitioner in the office, and unit-dosed sterile and non-sterile medications. USC’s outsourcing facility receives its active pharmaceutical ingredients from three main suppliers, which accounted for the majority of USC’s drug and chemical purchases in 2018.
     In recent years, there have been increases in the cost of certain injectable drugs and related products as a result of (i) enhanced oversight by the FDA and other regulatory bodies of manufacturers of injectable products, and the added costs associated therewith, (ii) decreased competition when drug manufacturers voluntarily cease producing certain drugs or face temporary regulatory suspension or permanent regulatory shut down of their operations, and (iii) consolidation among drug manufacturers. These factors have led some manufacturers to raise prices of some products and have also contributed to market shortages of injectable products, containers and diluents. These shortages and the potential inability to secure an adequate supply of necessary drug formulations can have a significant impact on the day-to-day business and operations of USC and its customers.
     Since we acquired USC in April 2016, we have taken several measures intended to support the growth of the business including hiring additional personnel, expanding sales channels, and strengthening our production processes. During 2019, we intend to move certain aspects of production into a new, larger facility that was in development during 2018. Initial commissioning and qualification are expected to commence in the first quarter of 2019. We believe that the new, larger facility will expand production capacity and allow for increased sales of products.
      USC has, and after our acquisition of USC we have, invested capital in efforts to comply with new and anticipated FDA regulations applicable to its business and outsourcing facilities, to expand product offerings, enhance production capabilities, improve warehouse space, develop new packaging, labeling and processing solutions, refine quality and safety measures, and develop technology for the intake and management of customer orders. Historically, research and development costs have consisted primarily of costs associated with the research and development of new CSPs, such as salaries and other personnel-related expenses for employees involved with research and development activities, pre-launch sterility and stability testing and other related expenses. Regulatory guidance provided by the FDA, and additional regulatory guidance is expected to increase the validation and development costs for current and new products.
        5 
 

 Regulatory Matters. Compounding outsourcing facilities have historically been subject to FDA inspections on an irregular basis and are now subject to FDA inspections on a risk-based schedule in accordance with DQSA Section 503B(b)(4). Observations by the FDA of potentially violative conditions during inspections are required to be reported to facility management at the close of the inspection on FDA Form 483. It is common for such reports to be provided in connection with inspections of compounding outsourcing facilities, and observations may be further followed by Warning Letters and other enforcement actions as the FDA deems warranted. In March 2014, August 2015, and July 2016, USC received Form 483 observations following FDA inspections of its outsourcing facility, noting inspectional observations of a number of observed deficiencies relating to USC’s facility and practices.
      Following the August 2015 Form 483 observations, and prior to our acquisition of USC, USC temporarily suspended production of sterile products and voluntarily recalled certain lots of sterile product. USC determined there was no evidence that any compounded sterile products were defective, but decided to voluntarily recall all sterile product that remained within expiry and temporarily halt sterile production. USC responded to the August 2015 Form 483 observations and took a number of corrective actions, including enhancing quality control and production systems. Approximately around the time of its acquisition by Adamis, USC resumed production and sale of its sterile products. In July 2016, USC received Form 483 observations following FDA inspections of its outsourcing facility, noting inspectional observations of a number of observed deficiencies relating to USC’s facility and practices. USC responded in writing to the inspectional observations in July 2016 and provided supplemental responses to FDA in April 2017. In October 2017, USC received a Warning Letter referencing the August 2015 and July 2016 Form 483 inspectional observations. USC provided a written response to the FDA that further described the completed corrective actions that were taken in response to the inspectional observations.  In November 2018, FDA responded to the 2017 Warning Letter response submitted by USC and indicated it would look for evidence of corrective action and further clarification of policies and procedures on a future inspection.
      Following the suspension and voluntary recall in 2015, state pharmacy regulatory agencies in certain states initiated inquiries or took other actions regarding sales of USC products in such states. All of these state matters have been resolved; however, future proceedings by the FDA or state regulatory agencies alleging violation of applicable federal or state laws or regulations, could require significant time and financial resources, and an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could adversely affect USC’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The suspension of sterile production and voluntary product recall had an adverse effect on USC’s revenues, income, and financial condition for calendar years 2015 and 2016 and adversely affected its relationships with certain of its customers that established relationships with other suppliers during USC’s suspension of sterile production.
      We cannot predict when or if we will receive additional Form 483 observations or other communications from the FDA or state regulatory authorities regarding USC’s compounding outsourcing facility or CSPs. We could be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA and civil or criminal enforcement action by the Department of Justice under the FDCA, Federal False Claims Act, or other applicable statutes, as well as related private actions, as a result of previous, current or future FDA observations. USC’s suppliers and customers may negatively consider the Form 483 observations issued to us when deciding to award contracts or continue or renew agreements. Other state and federal regulators and agencies may also consider the Form 483 observations when conducting their own inspections, enforcement actions or approvals, including license renewals. Any such actions could significantly disrupt USC’s business and harm its and our reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     In January 2018, FDA published a statement outlining its compounding priorities for 2018. Included in this statement were references to forthcoming regulations on compounding from bulk drug substances, determination of clinical need, and a revised memorandum of understanding between FDA and State Boards of Pharmacy setting forth limits on interstate compounding under Section 503A of the FDCA. The draft guidance documents published in 2018, which are of general application to compounding pharmacies, or other FDA regulations and guidance, potentially could limit the number and type of products USC is permitted to compound as well as interstate shipping of compounded medications, and could adversely affect sales of our compounded medications. In December 2018, FDA published a revised draft guidance on cGMP for 503B Outsourcing Facilities. USC is currently assessing this new guidance and any required improvements or changes to its processes, procedures, policies, or facility to achieve the expected level of compliance.
 Other Technologies
     We also have a microbicide product candidate, named C31G. In December 2010, we announced the successful completion of a Phase 3 contraceptive trial of C31G. The study met its primary endpoint and was conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), NIH, in the Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network at 14 sites in the United States. The clinical investigators found that C31G was not inferior in contraceptive efficacy to the comparator drug Conceptrol. Moreover, the gel was well-tolerated and had a high degree of acceptability in women who completed the study. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed with C31G. C31G does not contain nonoxynol-9 and, if commercialized, could offer an alternative for women who seek a non-hormonal method of contraception. In addition, in September 2013 we announced that a published study conducted by university researchers at Louisiana State University Health Science Center found that C31G was effective in treating Herpes Simplex Virus, or HSV, in an eye infection (ocular keratitis) animal model using live rabbits. In the same study the researchers also reported that ocular administration of C31G was safe and well tolerated, confirming earlier clinical studies that established C31G safety and tolerability in other applications. HSV-1 is the same virus that causes cold sores and is common in humans. In the eye, it usually causes an infection of the cornea, and that infection can cause cornea-derived blindness. In previous animal studies, C31G was also active against HSV-2, the cause of genital herpes.
             6 
 
      Before considering any actions to further develop or seek regulatory approval for a C31G product, further meetings with the FDA would be required to discuss the regulatory pathways for submitting an NDA for marketing approval, including the additional trials that would be required before an NDA is submitted. In considering commercialization alternatives, we would seek to enter into an out-licensing or similar transaction with third party entities or organizations. The C31G product candidate is held by our Biosyn, Inc. subsidiary, which we acquired in 2004. Provisions in the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Biosyn, and/or in certain of the funding or other agreements relating to the C31G product, provide for payments to the former Biosyn shareholders upon marketing approval by the FDA (or, in certain circumstances, certain foreign regulatory authorities) of C31G for one or more indications, and for payments to certain other third parties in the event of sales or other revenues relating to C31G or certain other events. In addition, sale or out-licensing of the C31G product candidate may require the consent of one or more such third parties. As a result, commercialization of the product could require, among other things, renegotiation with the former Biosyn shareholders and such third parties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will pursue commercialization of or conclude a transaction involving C31G or concerning the amounts that we might receive from any such transaction, or that any C31G product will be developed, submitted for regulatory approval, approved or marketed.
      Clinical Supplies and Manufacturing 
     Except for our facilities at USC that are utilized to prepare compounded formulations, we have no in-house manufacturing or distribution capabilities and have no current plans to establish manufacturing facilities for significant clinical or commercial production. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and make the material used to support the development of our product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. In complying with cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to ensure that their services and products meet applicable specifications and other requirements. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to development of products without devoting the resources and capital required to build cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities. Our Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products are manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, utilizing materials to complete the manufacturing process obtained from various companies and suppliers, and assembly and final packaging of the product is implemented by a third-party entity. There are potential sources of supply other than our existing suppliers, but new supplier would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements.
 Sales and Marketing 
    Our Symjepi™ (epinephrine) products will be marketed and sold in the U.S. markets by Sandoz pursuant to our commercialization agreement with Sandoz.  We sell compounded pharmacy formulations through USC’s sales and marketing employees and arrangements with third parties for sales and marketing support. Sales and marketing activities consist primarily of efforts to educate doctors, ambulatory surgery centers, healthcare systems, hospitals, veterinarians, and other users throughout the U.S. about USC’s products and services. USC’s sales and marketing team is focused on customer retention as well as generating sales from new and existing customers. 
      Customers and Distribution 
    On January 16, 2019, we announced that our marketing and commercial partner, Sandoz, a Novartis division, has launched Symjepi™ (epinephrine) 0.3 mg Injection in the US market. Symjepi™ will be rolled out via a phased launch and will initially be available in the institutional setting, an established channel where Sandoz has a significant experience and knowledge, followed by anticipated introduction into the retail market. Pursuant to our agreement with Sandoz, we are responsible for supplying the Symjepi™ products to Sandoz at a supply price for quantities of products ordered.  Revenues from sales of the company’s compounded pharmacy medications and compounds consist, in large part, of sales to clinics and hospitals.

 Competition 
     The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and those of our collaborators obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in the fields in which we compete.     Our products and product candidates, if developed, approved and launched, will compete with numerous prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter products targeting similar conditions, as well as prescription generic products. In addition, a number of large pharmaceuticals companies produce similar pharmaceutical products for similar indications. Moreover, certain products that previously have been available by prescription only have been or could in the future be approved by the FDA for sale over-the-counter without a prescription at a lower price than competing prescription products, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market a competing prescription product.
 
The Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products will compete against other self-administered epinephrine products, including EpiPen, EpiPen Jr., Auvi-Q and Adrenaclick. In addition, there has been market and regulatory focus during 2017 and 2018 on the prices to consumers of self-administered epinephrine products, which have exerted downward pressure on the pricing of such products. Competitors may reduce or otherwise modify the pricing of their existing products following the introduction our Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products. In addition, the company that markets the currently leading auto-injector product, EpiPen, has introduced an authorized generic version of the auto-injector product at a lower price than the EpiPen. Additionally, in late 2018 a generic, or A/B rated, competitor to EpiPen was approved and launched. Other competing products have been introduced or prices on existing competing products have been reduced, and if additional competing products are introduced in the future, including additional generic versions of one or more existing spring-loaded auto-injector devices, at lower prices than the current market leading products, the competitive success of our Symjepi products could be adversely affected. The competitive success of our products could also be adversely affected by changes in the willingness of insurance companies and other third-party payors to cover or reimburse some or all of the costs to consumers of our products. Our product candidates Naloxone Injection (APC-6000) for opioid overdose and Tadalafil (APC-8000) for ED, if approved and introduced, are expected to compete with other pharmaceuticals in the markets for opioid overdose and ED, respectively. Moreover, our APC-1000 and APC-4000 products, if developed and commercialized, are expected to compete with allergy inhaler and other products offered by several companies, including without limitation GlaxoSmithKline and Teva Respiratory, LLC.  
      Compounded Pharmacy Formulations. The compounded pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against other FDA-registered outsourcing facilities, branded drug companies, generic drug companies, regional compounders that provide patient-specific compounding that decide to expand to 503B outsourcing, non-patient-specific compounding, large hospitals and integrated delivery networks, other compounding pharmacies, and new entrants to the industry. Many competitors that market and sell compounded preparations have longer operating histories and may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We are significantly smaller than some of such competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of USC’s formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. These potential competitors could leverage existing resources and experience operating in industries that are subject to significant regulatory oversight in order to overcome certain barriers to entry. Consequently, competitors may be able to develop products and services competitive with, or superior to, USC’s products and services. Furthermore, we may not be able to differentiate USC’s compounded preparations and services from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new services—on a timely basis or at all—that are less costly than those of our competitors or offer customers payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. We expect competition to intensify as technology advances, such as those in the field of robotics and automation, and consolidation continues. Also, new developments by pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as increasing the number of abbreviated new drug applications, to cover less frequently used drug formulations, could render some or many of USC’s products or services obsolete. In addition, the drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which USC’s formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. USC’s compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA. As a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, USC’s formulations. Increased competition could reduce revenue and gross profit and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, guidance documents published by the FDA in 2018 require certain attestation of clinical need on behalf of the ordering physician or his or her delegate, and some entities may be unwilling or logistically unable to accommodate this new requirement. 
 
 Pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies and outsourcing facilities, could render USC’s products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete effectively. Other competitive factors include the safety and efficacy of a product, the size of the market for a product, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of a product relative to alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement, the success of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition and the availability of scientific and technical information about a product.
        8 
 

 Intellectual Property 

 Our success will depend in part on our ability to:
    
● | obtain and maintain international and domestic patents and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prosecute and defend our patents; 
● | preserve our trade secrets; and 
● | operate without infringing on the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. 

 
 We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs where applicable and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations. As of December 31, 2018, the company had: (i) 17 issued patents in the United States and 13 pending applications, one of which has been allowed; (ii) 72 issued and 41 pending foreign patent applications, one of which has been allowed, relating to our Symject™ injection device, DPI and C31G products and product candidates, among other things. The issued patents and allowed patents applications expire between 2019 and 2041, not taking into account any potential patent-term extensions that may be available in the future. 
     Although we believe that our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. It is possible that any patents or patent rights that we obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors.
     We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.
     Government Regulation 
     Pharmaceutical Regulation 
     The marketing of any pharmaceutical products in the United States is subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation.
     In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and generally require a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs. We also may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug product sales if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the United States varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
        9 
 

 Regulation in the United States 
     The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. We cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will ever obtain approval. Our product candidates that require marketing approval by the FDA will be regulated as drugs. In the United States, drugs are subject to regulation under the FDCA. The statute and related regulations govern, among other things, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices. The FDA approval process for new drugs generally includes, without limitation:
    
● | preclinical studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for clinical trials; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product; 
● | review of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and 
● | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations.

 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to good laboratory practices, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. The results of the preclinical studies, existing clinical and/or human use data (if applicable), together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which we are required to file before we can commence any clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of any additional IND for any of our preclinical product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. Also, clinical trials must be performed according to good clinical practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents.
     Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2 and 3. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
     In Phase 1 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on patients to determine safety, any adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects.
     In Phase 2 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of subjects to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
    In Phase 3 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a larger number of subjects in an expanded patient population to determine efficacy and to further determine safety, usually at multiple clinical sites.
      We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical trials will result in approval to market our products.
     An NDA must include comprehensive and complete descriptions of the preclinical testing, clinical trials and the chemical, manufacturing and control requirements of a drug that enable the FDA to determine the drug’s or biologic’s safety and efficacy. An NDA must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies, and must be submitted, filed and approved by the FDA before any drug product that we may successfully develop and that requires marketing approval by the FDA can be marketed commercially in the United States.
      The facilities, procedures and operations for any of our contract manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP, licensing specifications and other FDA regulations before and after an NDA has been approved. Foreign manufacturing facilities are also subject to periodic FDA inspections or inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs or other product applications if deficiencies are found at the facility. Vendors that may supply us with finished products or components used to manufacture, package and label products are also subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.
        10 
 

 In addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.
     Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
     Once the FDA receives an NDA, it has 60 days to review the application to determine if it is substantially complete and the data is readable, before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submission to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity.
      Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions, offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA also has established other special programs for NDAs that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs or provide for approval based on surrogate endpoints.  For example, the fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and address an unmet medical need. The FDA generally attempts to facilitate early and frequent meetings with sponsors of fast track drugs.  For a Priority Review application, the FDA aims to complete the initial review cycle for New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, within six months of the 60 day filing date, and for non-NMEs within six months of the date of receipt. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Review NDAs for NMEs within ten months of the 60 day filing date, and for Non-NMEs within ten months of the date of receipt. Such dates are often referred to as the PDUFA dates. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either Standard Reviews or Priority Reviews of NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. In addition, the FDA’s review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, issuance of a complete response letter, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding any required risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, FDA workload issues or other reasons. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS.  A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks.  REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professional, and elements to assure safe use. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to the application’s approval. The amount of time taken for the approval process is a function of a number of variables, including whether the product has received priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA.
      The FDA may, during its review of an NDA, ask for additional test data or the conducting of additional clinical trials. If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, it may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the product. In addition, the FDA may in some circumstances impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer and may require prior approval of promotional materials.
     Prior to regulatory approval, the FDA may elect to obtain advice from outside experts regarding scientific issues and/or marketing applications under FDA review. These outside experts are convened through the FDA’s Advisory Committee process. An Advisory Committee will report to the FDA and make recommendations. Views of the Advisory Committee may differ from those of the FDA, and the FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an Advisory Committee. 
     Before approving an NDA, the FDA can inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the submission unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the processes and procedures used are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the preclinical toxicology research sites to assure that the preclinical studies were conducted in compliance with GLP requirements. If the FDA determines that the studies were not performed in compliance with applicable GLP rules and regulations, the FDA may request additional preclinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved.
        11 
 

 The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the submission identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
     If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved drug or biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, the FDA review period can be lengthy and is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
     Following receipt of regulatory approval, any products that we market continue to be subject to extensive regulation including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product storage, sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label” use, and requirements relating to industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including the manufacture, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping related to the products. The FDA also frequently requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or places conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
     In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
     Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
        12 
 

 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, enacted in 2010, imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. The reforms imposed by the PPACA will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry; however, the full effects of the law cannot be known until these provisions are implemented. In addition, although the PPACA was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, it is possible that the PPACA or portions thereof may be modified, challenged or repealed in the future, or that future judicial decisions, executive orders or regulatory actions could affect the impact of the law on the pharmaceutical industry.
      If not preempted by federal law, several states require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing related activities. Other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Additional states may consider similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. If in the future some of our business activities were subject to challenge under one or more of such laws, an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
      In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace.
     The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These “off-label” uses are not unusual across certain medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to delay its approval or refuse to approve a product, suspend or withdraw of an approved product from the market, and could result in other consequences such as recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions, civil or criminal prosecution or penalties, or other possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity. Any of these consequences could harm our business.
     We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Our collaborators may also utilize third-parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
     Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
     Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to a Section 505(b)(1) NDA filing or an Abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. An alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
        13 
 

 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
     To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) application with respect to any patents for the previously approved product on which the applicant’s application relies that are listed in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
     If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest to occur of 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted after the fourth year of a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation.
     As a result, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of a product and our Section 505(b)(2) applications only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the prior NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time, assuming the application is otherwise approvable.
     Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
     We successfully pursued a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg product and our lower dose 0.15 mg version, we are pursuing Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings in connection with our naloxone injection and tadalafil products, for which we filed an NDA for each product in December 2018, and we intend to pursue a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filing in connection with our beclomethasone HFA and fluticasone DPI product candidates, if successfully developed. Accordingly, if we rely in our regulatory filing on clinical trials conducted, or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness, for a previously approved drug product that involves patents referenced in the Orange Book, then we will need to make the patent certifications or the Paragraph IV certification described above. If we make a Paragraph IV certification and the holder of the previously approved product that we referenced in our application initiates patent litigation within the time periods described above, then we will be subject to the risks of patent litigation, with the accompanying delay described above and potentially material expense of patent litigation, before we could commercially market our product.
      In addition, even if we submit a 505(b)(2) application, such as we submitted for the Symjepi™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg product and as we may submit for other future products, that relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved product where there are no patents for such other product with respect to which we have to provide certifications, we are subject to the risk that the FDA could disagree with our reliance on the particular previously approved product that we chose to rely on, conclude that such previously approved product is not an acceptable reference product, and require us instead to reference another previously approved product that involves patents referenced in the Orange Book, requiring us to make the certifications described above and subjecting us to the risks of delay and expense described above.

 Abbreviated New Drug Applications
     In contrast to the kind of clinical trial and other data that is required for an NDA submitted pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, contains data that, when submitted to the FDA pursuant to Section 505(j) of the FDCA, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a product commonly referred to as a “generic equivalent” or a “generic” drug product. These kinds of drug applications are called “abbreviated” because ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct or submit preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness of their product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Instead, a generic applicant must scientifically demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent, that is, that the product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. For locally acting inhaled products, we believe that demonstration of bioequivalency in most cases will require human clinical studies that demonstrate that the generic product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
     In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, in a manner generally similar to the certifications that are required in connection with Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings as described above. As with Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings, if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
     If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, then the procedures described above in connection with Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings also apply, and the risks of the patent holder initiating a patent infringement lawsuit as described above also apply. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients, but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug.
     Regulation Outside the United States 
     If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our clinical trials or drugs will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa.     Additional Regulation 
     Third-Party Reimbursement 
     In the United States, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase pharmaceutical products generally rely on third-party payors, principally private health insurance plans, Medicare and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product and procedure for which the product is being used. Even if a product is approved for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the product and related medical procedures. If they do not, end-users of the drug would not be eligible for any reimbursement of the cost, and our ability to successfully market any such drug would be materially and adversely impacted.
     Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, pricing negotiations could take significant additional time. As in the United States, the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit their widespread use and lower potential product revenues.
        15 
 

 Fraud and Abuse Laws 
     Federal and state anti-kickback and anti-fraud and abuse laws, as well as the federal Civil False Claims Act may apply to certain drug and device research and marketing practices. The Civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States. Actions under the Civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or by a private individual acting as an informer or whistleblower in the name of the government. Violations of the Civil False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties. The federal government is using the Civil False Claims Act, and the threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers, suppliers and drug and device manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of drug and device marketing and research practices, and has obtained multi-million dollar settlements. The federal government may continue to devote substantial resources toward investigating healthcare providers’, suppliers’ and drug and device manufacturers’ compliance with the Civil False Claims Act and other fraud and abuse laws. We may have to expend significant financial resources and management attention if we ever become the focus of such an investigation, even if we are not guilty of any wrongdoing.     HIPAA 
     We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, addresses the privacy and transmission of individually identifiable health information and, among other things, requires the use of standard transactions, privacy and security standards and other administrative simplification provisions, by covered entities which include many healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA instructs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations implementing these standards in the United States. HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Material monetary penalties and other remedies can result from violation of these laws and regulations. In addition, many state laws also address the privacy and security of health information, and many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, the European Union, or EU, has a separate data security and privacy legal framework, including the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which was adopted in 2018, which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information.  To the extent that we conduct clinical trials in the EU or otherwise expand our business operations to include operations in the EU, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR.
      Other Laws 
     We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, and various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other similar federal and state laws regarding, among other things, occupational safety, the use and handling of radioisotopes, environmental protection and hazardous substance control. Although as of the date of this Report we have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals that cause cancer, volatile solvents, radioactive materials and biological materials that have the potential to transmit disease, and our operations may produce hazardous waste products. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial financial liability or be required to suspend or modify our operations. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources.
     In addition, as an owner and operator of real property, we may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us, even if such contamination was not caused by us, as well as to claims for harm to health or property or for natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. Liability in many situations may be imposed not only without regard to fault, but may also be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share. We may also be subject to similar liabilities and claims in connection with locations at which hazardous substances or wastes that has generated have been stored, treated, otherwise managed or disposed. The costs of complying with, or other impact of, current or future environmental, health and safety requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Pharmacy Regulation 
     Our compounding pharmacy business conducted by USC is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; HIPAA; PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2012, collectively referred to as the Health Reform Law; statutes and regulations of the FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA; and state laws and regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the preparation, sale, advertisement and promotion of the compounded formulations that USC sells. Some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact USC’s operations are described below.
     USC’s pharmacy operations are regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state’s board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. Revisions to United States Pharmaceopeia Chapters <800> “Hazardous Drugs – Handling in Healthcare Setting,” <795> “Pharmaceutical Compounding – Non-Sterile Preparations,” and <797> “Pharmaceutical Compounding – Sterile Preparations” are expected to be published in July 2019 with effective dates of December 1, 2019. These new and revised chapters are incorporated by reference in most state regulations, and compliance with these revisions may require significant changes to procedures, policies, and facility design. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements or, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, USC's ability to operate in some states could be limited. At this time, there are no operating restrictions on USC’s licensure in any of the states where it is licensed, and none are pending or expected in the foreseeable future. The company believes that all permits are in good standing in all material respects.
         16 
 

 Most of the states into which USC delivers its formulations have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses or distributes medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state.
     The DQSA also contained new Section 503B of the FDCA, which established an outsourcing facility as a new form of entity that is permitted to compound large quantities of drug formulations without a prescription, thus permitting the practice of anticipatory compounding, and distribute them out of state without limitation, if the drug formulations appear on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appear on a list to be established by the FDA. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspection, among other requirements. USC currently operates as a 503B outsourcing facility and cannot predict when FDA will issue, finalize, or enforce new guidance documents that affect our business practices. Several guidance documents from FDA are currently in draft form, which does not preclude them from being enforceable by FDA, and USC cannot predict or control when Final Guidance might be issued or if any changes from draft versions will be introduced. Specifically, in December 2018, FDA published a revised draft guidance on cGMP for 503(b) Outsourcing Facilities and USC is currently assessing this new guidance and any required improvements or changes to its processes, procedures, policies, or facility to achieve the expected level of compliance. The DQSA prohibits compounding facilities, both 503A and 503B, from compounding products that are "essentially a copy" of approved drug products offered by traditional pharmaceutical manufacturers. In January 2018, the FDA published a Final Guidance on compounding from bulk ingredients and what it considers to be “essentially a copy” of approved drug products. This policy added the requirement that purchasers and prescribers document on each order and prescription the specific clinical need for the compounded medication. Some purchasers and prescribers may be unwilling to complete this additional documentation resulting in decrease demand for the compounded drug products. Additionally, in January 2018, the FDA published a statement outlining its compounding priorities for 2018. Included in this statement were references to forthcoming regulations on compounding from bulk drug substances, determination of clinical need, and a memorandum of understanding between FDA and State Boards of Pharmacy. The draft guidance documents published in 2018 which are of general application to compounding pharmacies, potentially could limit the number and type of products USC is permitted to compound and interstate shipping of compounded medications, and could adversely affect sales of our compounded medications.
      USC initiated actions in 2018 to separate a portion of its business activities into 503A prescriptions dispensed to individual patients and 503B compounds distributed to facilities and practitioners without a specific patient identified. In December 2016, FDA issued Final Guidance for Industry entitled “Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act.” This guidance document outlines that traditional 503A pharmacies can only dispense prescriptions pursuant to receipt of a valid prescription for a specifically identified individual patient. This December 2016 Guidance, in combination with the August 2015 Final Guidance for Industry “For Entities Considering Whether to Register as Outsourcing Facilities Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act,” and the May 2018 Guidance for Industry “Facility Definition Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act” effectively make compounding prescriptions for individual patients impractical as a 503B Outsourcing Facility and require separate physical operations for 503A and 503B operations that are not logistically feasible in USC’s existing facility. The process to open, commission, and license the new facility is expected to require additional capital expenditures in 2019.
      Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA
     USC’s pharmacy operations involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. The federal privacy regulations under HIPAA are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to electronic protected health information. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related.
     Medicare Reimbursement
     Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. Currently, most of USC’s formulations are sold in cash transactions and a small percentage of USC’s prescriptions are billed to Medicare and other third parties prescription benefits managers. Many third-party payors have imposed significant restrictions on reimbursement for compounded formulations in recent years. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Health Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivably adversely affect USC’s business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare and other third-party payors may never be available for any of USC’s products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow USC to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points.
     To the extent that USC obtains third-party reimbursement for its compounded formulations, it may become subject to Medicare, and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims.
     Food and Drug Administration
     As a human drug compounding outsourcing facility, USC is registered with, and regulated by, the FDA under the FDCA. In particular, the DQSA, which sets forth standards applicable to compounding outsourcing facilities such as USC’s, was enacted in November 2013, creating a new Section 503B in the FDCA, under which a compounder can voluntarily register as an outsourcing facility. USC has registered as an outsourcing facility.
        17 
 

In July 2014, the FDA issued a draft guidance entitled: Industry Current Good Manufacturing Practice—Interim Guidance for Human Drug Compounding Outsourcing Facilities Under Section 503B of the FD&C Act. According to the FDA, this “interim guidance describes the FDA’s expectations regarding compliance with cGMP requirements” for Section 503B compounding facilities. The guidance also notes that the FDA intends to promulgate more specific cGMP regulations for such facilities, but that until “final regulations are promulgated, this guidance describes the FDA’s expectations” regarding outsourcing facility compliance with cGMP requirements for drugs during the interim period. In December 2018, FDA published a revised draft guidance on cGMP for 503B Outsourcing Facilities. USC is currently assessing this new guidance and any required improvements or changes to its processes, procedures, policies, or facility to achieve the expected level of compliance. We cannot predict when the guidance will be finalized. The revised guidance for 503B outsourcing facilities regarding vendor qualification and incoming raw materials testing is onerous and could increase the cost of USC’s compounded medications.
      In June 2016, the FDA issued guidance entitled: “Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act – Guidance for Industry.” According to the FDA, this guidance sets forth the FDA’s interim regulatory policy concerning compounding by outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the FDCA using bulk drug substances. Section 503B of the FDCA includes certain restrictions on the bulk drug substances that outsourcing facilities can use in compounding and directs the FDA to develop a list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under that section. The FDA is developing that list of bulk drug substances, and this guidance describes the FDA’s interim regulatory policy regarding outsourcing facilities that compound human drug products using bulk drug substances while the list is being developed. In 2017, a pharmaceutical company filed suit against FDA in a federal district court alleging that the interim policy described above on compounding from bulk drug substances was an improper implementation of the 2013 Drug Quality & Security Act. In March 2018, the FDA published the draft guidance “Evaluation of Bulk Drug Substances Nominated for Use in Compounding Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act.” FDA also updated its interim lists of bulk drug substances on multiple occasions in 2018. In September 2018, the FDA and the pharmaceutical company that filed the suit agreed to an additional stay of the lawsuit until December 31, 2018, pending the FDA’s continued evaluation of its preliminary assessment that outsourcing facilities should not be able to compound drugs products that contain any of three specific bulk drug ingredients. On January 7, 2019, the district court entered another order staying the matter until counsel for the Federal Government notifies the Court that federal appropriations have been restored.  In March 2019, the FDA issued final guidance and moved to formally remove two substances from the interim list that permitted their use, and a decision regarding a third substance is still pending. While the three specific substances at issue in FDA’s updated interim list were not of material importance to USC, the potential exists for the FDA to take similar action in the future relative to other bulk drug substances that may be more significant to USC’s business, without extended notice, solicitation of comments, or Administrative Procedures Act procedures, which could result in a loss of revenue resulting from any affected USC products. USC is working proactively with industry stakeholders and regulatory authorities regarding the FDA’s guidance and actions, and believes that the impact on USC and other 503B outsourcing facilities of the regulatory expectations regarding bulk substances will depend in part on how the guidance is implemented, interpreted and applied over time. 
      Compounding outsourcing facilities have historically been subject to FDA inspections on an irregular basis and are now subject to FDA inspections on a risk-based schedule in accordance with DQSA Section 503B(b)(4). Observations by the FDA of potentially violative conditions during inspections are required to be reported to facility management at the close of the inspection on FDA Form 483. It is common for such reports to be provided in connection with inspections of compounding outsourcing facilities, and observations may be further followed by Warning Letters and other enforcement actions as the FDA deems warranted. As described elsewhere under the heading “Business of U.S. Compounding, Inc. – Overview – Regulatory Matters,” USC has received Form 483 observations in the past following FDA facility inspections, including in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Following the August 2015 Form 483 observations, USC temporarily suspended production of sterile products and voluntarily recalled all lots of sterile products aseptically compounded and packaged by USC that remained within expiry, due to the FDA’s concern over a lack of sterility assurance. Issuance of a Form 483 from FDA has the potential to result in additional regulatory restrictions from the various State Boards of Pharmacy that could limit business in those states on a temporary or permanent basis. Following the 2016 inspection, USC was issued a Form 483 listing inspectional observations. USC responded in writing in July 2016 and again in April 2017. In October 2017, FDA issued a Warning Letter to USC summarizing its concerns from the 2015 and 2016 inspections. USC provided FDA with a written response detailing corrective actions taken, including regarding differential pressures, facility design, environmental monitoring, product specifications, and suspension quality. In November 2018, FDA responded to the 2017 Warning Letter Response submitted by USC and indicated that it would look for evidence of corrective action and further clarification of policies and procedures on a future inspection.
      Drug Enforcement Administration
     USC maintains registrations with the DEA that enables USC to receive, manufacture, store and distribute controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. DEA drug scheduling is based on the potential for abuse. Laws enforced by the DEA, as well as similar state agencies, require each location that handles controlled substances to separately register.
     The CSA governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. USC’s compounding outsourcing facilities that handle controlled substances are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with DEA and state controlled substances regulations.
     Procurement quota requirements imposed by the DEA on USC’s purchases of materials containing controlled substances necessitate regular applications to the DEA for permission to purchase materials essential to the production of many of USC’s CSPs. Any inability to obtain authorization from the DEA to procure controlled drugs for use in USC’s business could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2017, the DEA issued a statement indicating it would significantly decrease the procurement quotas it issued for opiates in an effort to curb the national opioid abuse crisis. This decrease could limit USC’s ability to procure controlled substances and adversely impact our revenues and results of operations; however, USC works with both DEA and customers to address these issues.
      Environmental and Other Matters
     USC is or may become subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by USC of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with research and preparation of compounded formulations. USC is subject to work safety and labor laws that govern certain of its operations and employee relations. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, licenses or permits, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
