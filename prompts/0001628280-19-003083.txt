Business

GENERAL
Clearwater Paper manufactures quality consumer tissue, away-from-home (or AFH) tissue, parent roll tissue, bleached paperboard and pulp at manufacturing facilities across the nation. The Company is a premier supplier of private label tissue to major retailers and wholesale distributors, including grocery, drug, mass merchants and discount stores. In addition, the company produces bleached paperboard used by quality-conscious printers and packaging converters, and offers services that include custom sheeting, slitting and cutting. Clearwater Paper's employees build shareholder value by developing strong customer relationships through quality and service.
On December 16, 2016, we acquired Manchester Industries, or Manchester, an independently-owned paperboard sales, sheeting and distribution supplier to the packaging and commercial print industries. The addition of Manchester's customers to our paperboard business extended our reach and service platform to small and mid-sized folding carton plants, as we now offer a range of converting services that include custom sheeting, slitting and cutting. These converting operations include five strategically located facilities in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Texas and Michigan.
On March 31, 2017, we permanently closed our Oklahoma City, Oklahoma converting facility. 
On August 21, 2018, we completed the sale of our Ladysmith, Wisconsin tissue manufacturing facility to a private buyer. 
Company Strengths
Leading private label tissue manufacturer with a broad U.S. footprint. Our Consumer Products business is a premier private label tissue manufacturer. We have through-air-dried, or TAD, tissue manufacturing facilities in Shelby, North Carolina and Las Vegas, Nevada, and non-TAD manufacturing facilities located in Lewiston, Idaho and Neenah, Wisconsin, as well as converting operations strategically located across the United States. In addition, in 2019 we expect to complete construction of a new NTT machine at our Shelby facility that will produce a variety of high-quality ultra-premium and premium bath, paper towel and napkin products. We believe we were the seventh largest tissue manufacturer in the North American tissue market as of December 31, 2018, based on tissue parent roll capacity. Our broad manufacturing footprint allows us to service a diverse customer base, on a cost effective basis, including major grocery store chains and retailers across the U.S.
High quality brand-equivalent tissue and other products to meet retailers' private label strategies. Our Consumer Products business produces high-quality products that match the quality of the leading national brands. We focus on high value tissue products across a wide variety of categories and retail channels. We also manufacture a broad range of cost-competitive consumer tissue products, as well as recycled tissue and tissue parent rolls.
High quality premium bleached paperboard products. Our Pulp and Paperboard business produces premium paperboard products with ultra-smooth print surfaces, superior cleanliness, and excellent forming and sealing characteristics. Products are available in several thicknesses to provide the level of rigidity and strength needed for a wide range of applications. The high quality of our paperboard allows buyers to use our products for packaging where branding and quality are critical, such as ice cream containers, drink cups, health and beauty packaging, pharmaceutical packaging, and point of purchase displays.
Long-standing customer relationships. Our Consumer Products business supplies private label tissue products to several of the largest national retail chains. Our top 10 Consumer Products customers in 2018 accounted for approximately 80% of our total consumer products net sales. The average tenure of these customer relationships was approximately 12 years. Our Consumer Products business served 69 customers in 2018 across a broad geographic area. We also have long-standing customer relationships with our paperboard customers. Our top 10 paperboard customers in 2018 accounted for approximately 40% of our total paperboard net sales. The average tenure of these customer relationships was approximately 30 years.
Strategically positioned Pulp and Paperboard facilities. Our Pulp and Paperboard mill in Lewiston, Idaho is one of only two solid bleach sulfate, or SBS, paperboard mills, and the only coated SBS paperboard mill, in the Western U.S. to offer a full range of specialized products to meet the needs of customers for traditional folding carton, plates, cups and liquid packaging products. This facility's geographic location reduces transportation costs to customers in North America as well as Asia, which allows us to compete on a cost-advantaged basis relative to East Coast producers. Our Cypress Bend, Arkansas mill is centrally located, which reduces transportation costs to the Midwestern and Eastern U.S. and complements the Lewiston mill in shipping to customers nationwide.

Largely integrated pulp and tissue operations. Our Consumer Products business sources a significant portion of its pulp supply internally from our pulp and paperboard operations in Idaho. This relationship provides our Consumer Products business with a secure pulp supply as well as significant transportation and drying cost savings, provides our pulp and paperboard business with a steady demand source and helps mitigate input cost volatility associated with purchasing external pulp.
Strategy
Our long-term strategy is to expand our business to meet the needs of our customers and optimize the profitability of both our consumer products business and our paperboard business. In the near-term, our focus is on successfully completing strategic capital projects, optimizing the operating efficiency and cost effectiveness of both segments of our company and reducing debt.
ORGANIZATION
Our businesses are organized into two operating segments: Consumer Products and Pulp and Paperboard. Additional information relating to the amounts of net sales, operating income, depreciation and amortization, identifiable assets and capital expenditures attributable to each of our operating segments for 2016-2018, as well as geographic information regarding our net sales, is set forth in Note 19, "Segment Information" to our consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Consumer Products Segment
Our Consumer Products segment manufactures and sells a complete line of at-home tissue products as well as AFH products. Our integrated manufacturing and converting operations and geographic footprint enable us to deliver a broad range of cost-competitive products with brand equivalent quality to our customers. In 2018, our Consumer Products segment had net sales of $884.8 million. A listing of our Consumer Products segment facilities is included under Part I, Item 2 of this report.
Tissue Industry Overview
The U.S. tissue market can be divided into two market segments: the at-home or consumer retail purchase segment, which represented approximately two-thirds of our U.S. tissue sales in 2018; and the AFH segment, which represents the remaining one-third of U.S. tissue market sales and includes tissue for locations such as restaurants, hotels and office buildings. 
The U.S. at-home tissue segment consists of bath, paper towels, facial and napkin products categories. Each category is further distinguished according to quality segments: ultra, premium, value and economy. As a result of manufacturing process improvements and consumer preferences, the majority of at-home tissue sold in the U.S. is ultra and premium quality.
At-home tissue producers are comprised of companies that manufacture branded tissue products, private label tissue products, or both. Branded tissue suppliers manufacture, market and sell tissue products under their own nationally branded labels. Private label tissue producers manufacture tissue products for retailers to sell as their store brand.
In the U.S., at-home tissue is primarily sold through grocery stores, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, drug stores and discount dollar stores. Tissue has historically been one of the strongest segments of the paper industry due to its steady demand growth largely due to population growth in the U.S., that occur in a number of other paper industry segments. In addition to economic and demographic drivers, tissue demand is affected by product innovations and shifts in distribution channels.
Our Consumer Products Business
We believe that we are the only U.S. consumer tissue manufacturer that solely produces a full line of quality private label tissue products for large retail trade channels. Most U.S. tissue producers manufacture only branded products, or both branded and private label products, or in the case of certain smaller or midsize manufacturers, only produce a limited range of tissue products or quality segments. Because we do not mass produce and market branded tissue products, we believe we are able to offer products that match the quality of leading national brands, but generally at lower prices. We utilize independent companies to routinely test our product quality.

In bathroom tissue, the majority of our sales are high quality two-ply ultra and premium products. In paper towels, we produce and sell ultra quality towels as well as premium and value towels. In the facial category, we sell ultra-lotion three-ply and a complete line of two-ply premium products, as well as value facial tissue. In napkins, we manufacture ultra two- and three-ply dinner napkins, as well as premium and value one-ply luncheon napkins. Value grade products utilizing recycled fiber are also produced for customers who wish to further diversify their product portfolio. We compete primarily in the at-home portion of the U.S. tissue market, which made up approximately 90% of our Consumer Products segment sales in 2018.
We manufacture and sell a line of AFH products to customers with commercial and industrial tissue needs. Products include conventional one- and two-ply bath tissue, two-ply paper towels, hard wound towels and dispenser napkins.
As of December 31, 2018, our consumer products were manufactured on 8 paper machines at four facilities located throughout the U.S. Parent rolls from our paper machines are then converted and packaged at our converting facilities located across the U.S. Two of our paper machines, located in Las Vegas, Nevada and Shelby, North Carolina, produce TAD tissue that we convert into national brand comparable, ultra quality towels and bath tissue. Our new paper machine in Shelby, which we expect to be completed in early 2019 and will be fully operational in 2020, will provide national brand comparable ultra-premium and premium quality towels and bath tissue.
We had one customer in the Consumer Products segment, the Kroger Company, that accounted for approximately 11.1% of our total consolidated net sales in 2018, approximately 15.3%, of our total consolidated net sales in 2017, and approximately 13.4%, of our total company net sales in 2016.
We sell private label tissue products through our own sales force and compete based on product quality, customer service and price. We deliver customer-focused business solutions by assisting in managing product assortment, category management, and pricing and promotion optimization.
Pulp and Paperboard Segment
Our Pulp and Paperboard segment manufactures and markets bleached paperboard for the high-end segment of the packaging industry and is a leading producer of SBS paperboard. It also offers services that include custom sheeting, slitting and cutting of paperboard. This segment also produces hardwood and softwood pulp, which is primarily used as the basis for our paperboard products, and slush pulp, which supplies to our Consumer Products segment. In 2018, our Pulp and Paperboard segment had net sales of $839.4 million. A listing of our Pulp and Paperboard segment facilities is included under Part I, Item 2 of this report.
Pulp and Paperboard Industry Overview
SBS paperboard is a premium paperboard grade that is most frequently used to produce folding cartons, liquid packaging, cups and plates, blister and carded packaging, top sheet, and commercial printing items. SBS paperboard is used for such products because it is manufactured using virgin fiber combined with the kraft bleaching process, which results in superior cleanliness, brightness and consistency. SBS paperboard is often manufactured with a clay coating to provide superior surface printing qualities. We also have the capability to produce targeted grades with a percentage of post-consumer furnish. SBS paperboard can also be extrusion coated with a barrier film to provide moisture protection for some uses.
In general, the process of making paperboard begins by chemically cooking wood fibers to make pulp. The pulp is bleached to provide a white, bright pulp, which is formed into paperboard. Bleached pulp that is to be used as market pulp is dried and baled on a pulp drying machine, bypassing the paperboard machines. The various grades of paperboard are wound into rolls for converting to final end users. Liquid packaging and cup stock grades are often coated with polyethylene, a plastic coating, in a separate operation to create a resistant and durable liquid barrier.
Folding Carton Category. Folding carton is the largest portion of the SBS category of the U.S. paperboard industry, comprising approximately 40% of the category in 2018. Within the folding carton segment there are varying qualities of SBS paperboard. The high end of the folding carton category in general requires a premium print surface and includes uses such as packaging for pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other premium retail goods. SBS paperboard is also used in the packaging of frozen foods, beverages and baked goods. 
Liquid Packaging and Cup Category. SBS liquid packaging paperboard is primarily used in the U.S. for the packaging of juices. In Japan and other Asian countries, SBS liquid packaging paperboard is primarily used for the packaging of milk and a wide range of consumable liquids, including alcoholic beverages. The cup segment of the market consists primarily of hot and cold drink cups and food packaging. The hot and cold cups are primarily used to serve beverages in quick-service restaurants, while round food containers are often used for packaging premium ice-cream, hot noodle and dry food products. 
4

Commercial Printing Category. Commercial printing applications use bleached bristols, which are heavyweight paper grades, to produce postcards, signage and promotional literature. Bristols can be clay coated on one side or both sides for applications such as brochures, presentation folders and paperback book covers. Customers in this segment are accustomed to high-quality paper grades, which possess superior printability and brightness compared to most paperboard packaging grades. Suppliers to this segment must be able to deliver small volumes, often within 24 hours. 
Market Pulp. The majority of the pulp manufactured worldwide is used in paper and paperboard production, usually at the same mill location. In those cases where a paper mill is not paired with pulp production operations or requires pulp with different production qualities, it must purchase pulp on the open market. Market pulp is defined as pulp produced for sale to these customers and it excludes tonnage consumed by the producing mill or shipped to any of its affiliated mills within the same company.
Our Pulp and Paperboard Business
Our Pulp and Paperboard segment operates pulp and paperboard facilities in Idaho, which has two paperboard machines, and Arkansas, which has one paperboard machine. As of December 31, 2018, we were one of the four largest producers of bleached paperboard in North America with approximately 14% of the available production capacity. Additionally, we provide custom sheeting, slitting, and cutting of paperboard products from five converting facilities. 
Our overall pulp and paperboard production consists primarily of folding carton, liquid packaging, cup and plate products, blister and carded packaging, top sheet, commercial printing grades and hardwood and softwood pulp. 
Folding carton board used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other premium packaging, such as those that incorporate foil and holographic lamination, accounts for the largest portion of our total paperboard sales. We focus on high-end folding carton applications where the heightened product quality requirements provide for differentiation among suppliers, generally resulting in margins that are more attractive than less demanding packaging applications.
Our liquid packaging paperboard is known for its cleanliness and printability, and is engineered for long-lived performance due to its three-ply, softwood construction. Our reputation for producing liquid packaging meeting the most demanding standards for paperboard quality and cleanliness has resulted in meaningful sales in Japan, where consumers have a particular tendency to associate blemish-free, vibrant packaging with the cleanliness, quality and freshness of the liquids contained inside.
We also sell cup stock and plate stock grades for use in standard food service products. 
With the exception of our capability to supply just-in-time sheeting and narrow rolls, we do not produce converted paperboard end-products, so we are not simultaneously a supplier of and a competitor to our customers in key market segments, notably folding carton and cup. Of the five largest SBS paperboard producers in the U.S., we are the only producer that does not convert SBS paperboard into folding cartons, cups, plates, or liquid packaging end-use products. We position our independent status to attract a diverse group of loyal customers because when there is increased market demand for paperboard, we do not divert our production to internal uses. 
We can convert paperboard parent rolls to flat sheets and narrow rolls, which expands our in-market service capabilities and allows us to support small and mid-sized folding carton converters that buy sheeted paperboard to convert into packaging end-products. Providing a service platform in this way expands the key folding carton segment of our business and does not compete with our customers in other key market segments.
At our Idaho facility we produce bleached softwood pulp primarily for internal use, including in our Consumer Products segment.
With the recent installation of a continuous pulp digester at our Idaho facility, our pulp mills are capable of producing approximately 904,000 tons of pulp on an annual basis. We completed the continuous pulp digester installation at our Idaho facility at the end of the third quarter of 2017. In 2018, we produced approximately 838,000 tons of pulp in the aggregate and utilized approximately 81% of that production, or approximately 680,000 tons, to produce approximately 810,000 tons of paperboard. The increase in tonnage from pulp to paperboard production is due to the addition of coatings and other manufacturing processes. We also used approximately 19% of our pulp production, or approximately 156,000 tons, in our Consumer Products segment to produce tissue products. The remaining pulp production of less than 1%, or approximately 2,000 tons, was sold externally by our Consumer Products segment.
We utilize various methods for the sale and distribution of our paperboard and softwood pulp. The majority of our paperboard is sold to packaging converters domestically through sales managers located throughout the U.S., with a smaller percentage channeled through distribution to commercial printers. Additionally, we directly sell sheeted paperboard products to folding carton converters, merchants and commercial printers. The majority of our international paperboard sales are conducted through sales agents and are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Our principal methods of competing are product quality, customer service and price.

RAW MATERIALS AND INPUT COSTS
For our manufacturing operations, the principal raw material used is wood fiber, which consists of purchased pulp and chips, sawdust and logs. In 2018, our Consumer Products segment sourced approximately 51% of its total pulp supply internally, with the remainder purchased from external suppliers. We own and operate a wood chipping facility located in Clarkston, Washington, near our Lewiston, Idaho, facility, which we believe bolsters our wood fiber position and provides short-term and long-term cost savings.
We utilize a significant amount of chemicals in the production of pulp and paper, including caustic, polyethylene, starch, sodium chlorate, latex and specialty process paper chemicals. A portion of the chemicals used in our manufacturing processes, particularly in the pulp-making process, are petroleum-based or are impacted by petroleum prices. 
Transportation is a significant cost input for our business. Fuel prices, mileage driven and line-haul rates impact our transportation costs for delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities, internal inventory transfers and delivery of our finished products to customers. 
We consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity, hog fuel, steam and natural gas. We purchase a significant portion of our natural gas and electricity under supply contracts, most of which are between a specific facility and a specific local provider. Under most of these contracts, the providers have agreed to provide us with our requirements for a particular type of energy at a specific facility. Most of these contracts have pricing mechanisms that adjust or set prices based on current market prices. In addition, we use firm-price contracts to mitigate price risk for certain of our energy requirements.
As a significant producer of private label consumer tissue products, we also incur expenses related to packaging supplies used for retail chains, wholesalers and cooperative buying organizations. 
Our maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. We perform routine maintenance on our machines and equipment and periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors, pumps, pipes and electrical parts. 
We also record depreciation expense associated with our plant and equipment. 
Further information regarding our raw material and input costs is included under "Operating Costs" within Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this report.
SEASONALITY
Our Consumer Products segment experiences a decrease in shipments during the fourth quarter generally as a result of decreased consumer demand, retail brand holiday promotions, and end of year inventory management by non-retail customers.  In addition, customer buying patterns for our paperboard generally result in lower sales for certain grades of our Pulp and Paperboard segment during the first and fourth quarters, when compared to the second and third quarters of a given year.
