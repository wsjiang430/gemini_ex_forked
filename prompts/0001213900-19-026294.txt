ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
We are a Canadian-registered holding company that is engaged in various aspects of the oil and gas industry. Our primary focus is on the development and implementation of our proprietary oil sands mining and processing technology to recover oil from surface mined bitumen deposits. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Petroteq Energy CA, Inc., a California corporation (“PQE”), conducts our oil sands extraction business through two wholly owned operating companies, Petroteq Oil Sands Recovery, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“PQE Oil”), and TMC Capital, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“TMC”). Another subsidiary, Petrobloq LLC, a California limited liability company (“Petrobloq”), also wholly owned by PQE, is developing a blockchain-powered supply chain management platform for the oil and gas industry.
OIL SANDS MINING & PROCESSING
 
PQE, through its wholly owned subsidiaries PQE Oil and TMC, is in the business of oil sands mining and processing. Historically, all of PQE’s oil sands mining has occurred on a mineral lease located in the Asphalt Ridge area in eastern Utah, where it mines oil sands deposits containing heavy oil and bitumen located at or near the surface. Once mined, the oil sands ore is treated and processed for the extraction and upgrade of crude oil through the application of PQE’s proprietary extraction technology (the “Extraction Technology”) at a processing facility owned/operated by PQE Oil. In 2016, PQE Oil’s mining operations were temporarily suspended due to the relocation of its processing facility to a site within the TMC Mineral Lease in order to improve logistical and processing efficiencies and increase production capacity. PQE recommenced its oil sands mining and processing activities at the end of May 2018 and commenced commercial production during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 (the quarter ended November 30, 2019). Production at or near full capacity is expected in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. During the year ended August 31, 2019 we generated revenue of $59,335 which represents the sale of hydrocarbon products to refineries to determine the commercial quality of our hydrocarbon products.

Oil Sands Exploration and Processing Plant 
 
In June 2011, PQE commenced the development of an oil sands extraction facility near Maeser, Utah and entered into construction and equipment fabrication contracts for the purpose of evaluating the Extraction Technology in producing a marketable crude oil from the extraction and processing of oil sands mined from the TMC Mineral Lease and from other deposits located in the Asphalt Ridge area. By January 2014 our initial processing facility, designed as a pilot plant having processing capacity of 250 barrels per day, was fully permitted and construction was completed by October 1, 2014. Operations conducted at this initial pilot plant during 2015 allowed us to test and evaluate the Extraction Technology at or near the plant’s capacity. During 2015, the plant produced approximately 10,000 (gross) barrels of oil from the local oil sands ores, including oil sands deposits located within our TMC Mineral Lease. From this production, 7,777.33 barrels of finished crude oil were sold to an oil and gas distributor for resale to its refinery customers, with the balance of the produced oil used internally to power generators for the plant. The initial processing plant was flexible in that it had the ability to produce both high quality heavy crude oil as well as lighter oil if needed.
 
In 2015, with the sharp decline in oil prices, PQE determined that the transportation costs of hauling mined ore from our mine site to the processing facility, a distance of approximately 17 miles, were adversely affecting the economics of our processing operations. For that reason and because of a downturn in world oil prices at that time, in 2016 we temporarily suspended operations. In 2017, the plant was disassembled and moved from its original location to the site of our Temple Mountain mining site (referred to as the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1) located within the TMC Mineral Lease, where the plant was reconstructed. During the reassembly of the facility, additional equipment was installed to increase the plant’s capacity from 250 barrels per day to 1,000 barrels per day. In May 2018, mining operations at the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 recommenced and the new processing plant commenced a test production phase of heavy crude oil from oil sands deposits at this site. Production at or near full capacity at the plant is not anticipated until the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
 
Since May 2018, following completion of the test production phase at our new processing plant, we have operated only one of three production lines at the plant while awaiting the installation of equipment that will enable us to operate the other two production lines. We recently curtailed operations during a maintenance program in order to make equipment alterations and to install new equipment. With construction and installation of the expanded facilities at the plant having been substantially completed, we expect that the plant will have a capacity of up to 1,000 barrels per day and we anticipate that production at or near the expanded capacity will be achieved by the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and do not anticipate that the delays in completing the plant’s expansion will materially impact any of the requirements for continuous operations under the TMC Mineral Lease. Management’s current estimate of the total cost of our Utah oil sands processing facility, including the expansion of processing capacity in order to meet the requirements under the TMC Mineral Lease, exclusive of capitalized borrowing costs and lease costs, is between $28 million and $30 million.
 
Resources and Mining Operations
 
Through its acquisition of TMC in June 2015, PQE indirectly acquired certain mineral rights under the TMC Mineral Lease, consisting of a Mining and Mineral Lease Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2013, between Asphalt Ridge, Inc., as lessor, and TMC, as lessee, covering approximately 1,229.82 acres of land in the Asphalt Ridge area of Uintah County, Utah. In June 2018, PQE acquired additional mineral rights under two mineral leases entitled “Utah State Mineral Lease for Bituminous-Asphaltic Sands”, each dated June 1, 2018, between the State of Utah’s School and Institutional Trust Land Administration (“SITLA”), as lessor, and PQE Oil, as lessee, covering lands that largely adjoin the lands covered by the TMC Mineral Lease ( “SITLA Leases”). More recently, in April 2019 and in July 2019, in two separate transactions, TMC acquired an initial 50% and then the remaining 50% of the operating rights under five (5) federal (U.S.) oil and gas leases, administered by the (U.S.) Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), covering lands located in eastern and southeastern Utah (“BLM Leases”). At this time, PQE (through its subsidiaries) holds mineral leases (or the operating rights under leases) covering approximately 8,501.76 net acres within the State of Utah, consisting of 1,229.82 acres held under the TMC Mineral Lease, 1,311.94 acres held under the SITLA Leases and 5.960 acres under the BLM Leases.

The TMC Mineral Lease covers lands situated in or near Utah’s Asphalt Ridge, an area located along the northern edge of the Uintah Basin and containing oil sands deposits located at or near the surface. Most of the oil-impregnated reservoirs or deposits in the Asphalt Ridge area are found in the Rimrock Sandstone (Mesaverde Group Formations) and in the (Tertiary) Duchense River Formation. Substantial bitumen deposits in the Rimrock and Duchense River Formations extend from the northwest in a southeasterly direction through a substantial part of the lands included in the TMC Mineral Lease, particularly the acreage located in T5S-R21E (Section 25) and T5S-R22E (Section 31) where our Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 is located. Bitumen-saturated pay thicknesses in lands covered by the TMC Mineral Lease generally range from 50-200 feet, with some deposits approaching 300 feet in pay thickness. PQE believes that oil sands deposits in this area may be mined economically at depths up to 250-300 feet below the surface.

The TMC Mineral Lease
 
Under the TMC Mineral Lease, TMC has the exclusive right to explore for, mine and produce oil and other minerals associated with oil sands, subject to certain depth limits. The TMC Mineral Lease was amended on October 1, 2015 and further amended on March 1, 2016, on February 1, 2018, and most recently on November 21, 2018. The primary term (the “Primary Term”) of the TMC Mineral Lease, as amended, commenced July 1, 2013 and continues for six years, plus an extension period. The term “extension period” was originally defined as a period of time measured from March 1, 2018 to the earlier of (i) March 1, 2019, or (ii) the date on which TMC delivers to the lessor a written financial commitment for the construction of PQE’s second proposed facility (or an expansion to PQE’s existing processing facility), this has since been superseded by the terms as described below.
 
During the Primary Term, if TMC fails to satisfy the requirements of “continuous operations”, the TMC Primary Lease will terminate unless the parties agree in writing to continue the Lease. If TMC, at the end of the Primary Term, has satisfied the requirements of continuous operations, the TMC Mineral Lease will continue in effect beyond the Primary Term as long as TMC continues to comply with any applicable requirements of continuous operations. Under the Lease, the term “continuous operations” consists of the following two requirements:
 

● | Processing Capacity. TMC must construct or operate one or more facilities (or any expansion to an existing facility) having the capacity to produce an average daily quantity (“ADQ”) of oil or other hydrocarbon products from oil sands mined or extracted from the Lease that, in the aggregate, will achieve (or exceed) the following: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
By 07-01-2019, 80% of an ADQ of 1,000 barrels/day;
 By 07-01-2020, 80% of an ADQ of 2,000 barrels/day; and
 By 07-01-2021 (and for the remaining term of the Lease), 80% of an ADQ of 3,000 barrels/day.
 

● | Minimum Operations. From and after July 1, 2019, TMC must achieve oil sands processing operations that equal (or exceed) the applicable ADQ requirements specified above, either (i) during at least 180 days in each lease year, or (ii) during at least 600 days in any three consecutive lease years. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The TMC Mineral Lease is also subject to termination under the circumstances described below:
 

(i) | Termination will be automatic if TMC fails to obtain (a) by July 1, 2019, a written financial commitment to fund a second processing facility (or a facility expansion) that will increase our processing capacity by an additional 1,000 barrels per day (achieving an aggregate capacity of 2,000 barrels per day), and (b) by July 1, 2020, a written financial commitment to fund a third processing facility (or facility expansion) that will increase our processing capacity by an additional 1,000 barrels per day (achieving an aggregate capacity of 3,000 barrels per day). We expect that the cost of constructing each of the two additional processing facilities (or any expansion) will range between $10 million and $12 million, which we intend to fund from revenue derived from operations or from third party funding sources. However, to date revenue from our operations has been minimal and we currently have no financial commitment to fund the capital costs for these facilities as required under the TMC Mineral Lease. (See Risk Factors – “Our operations are dependent upon maintaining our mineral lease for the Asphalt Ridge Property”).

(ii) | Cessation of operations or inadequate production due to increased operating costs or decreased marketability and production is not restored to 80% of capacity within three months of any such cessation will cause a termination. 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Cessation of operations for longer than 180 days during any lease year or 600 days in any three consecutive years will cause a termination. 
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | From and after July 1, 2021, a failure of PQE’s processing facility to produce a minimum of 80% of a rated capacity of 3,000 barrels per day during a period of at least 180 calendar days during any lease year, the Lease may be terminated by the lessor. 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | TMC may surrender the lease with 30 days written notice. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(vi) | In the event of a breach of the material terms of the lease, the lessor will inform TMC in writing and TMC will have 30 days to cure any monetary breach and 150 days to cure any non-monetary breach. 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are currently in full compliance with the terms of the TMC Mineral Lease. As of August 31, 2019, we have paid advance royalties of $2,250,336 (August 31, 2018 - $1,890,336) to the lessor, of which a total of $1,382,307 has been used as a credit against production royalties that have accrued under the terms of the TMC Mineral Lease. The royalties expensed have been recognized in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss.
 
From and after July 1, 2021, we must make a minimum annual expenditure of $2,000,000 under the TMC Mineral Lease if an average daily production of 3,000 barrels is not achieved during a 180 day period each year.
 
During the year ended August 31, 2019, we received (gross) proceeds of $59,335 from the sale of upgraded or finished oil produced at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility from oil sands mined under the TMC Mineral Lease. During our fiscal years ending August 31, 2018, August 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no sales of produced oil since, during this period, we temporarily suspended our mining and processing operations during the relocation, reassembly and expansion of our process facility to a new site located within the TMC Mineral Lease.
 
During the last five (5) months of 2015, we produced approximately 10,000 barrels of oil, with 2,222 barrels consumed as fuel in plant operations and 7,777.33 barrels sold and delivered to an independent purchaser at our processing facility. Our use of produced oil as a fuel source for plant generators in 2015 is no longer necessary since the plant’s power supply is now provided by a local power company. 
 
Our average sales from production, average costs of production and average API gravity of the oil produced at our initial pilot processing facility during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2015 were as follows:
 

i) | Average production sales and sales prices for fiscal year 2015.

(1) | Production sold during this period is not subject to adjustment for royalties or taxes. Oil sold during this period was produced from bitumen ore purchased from third parties and from a stockpile of mined ore at our Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 site that is exempt from royalties under the TMC Mineral Lease and from the overriding royalty held by Temple Mountain Energy, Inc. Under Utah law, no severance tax is imposed on oil and gas produced from oil sands or oil shale until June 2026.

The costs associated with extraction and processing operations at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility which are used in determining our “Average Production Costs” – include the costs of oil sands ore, natural gas liquids, aromatic solvent, operator labor, electricity, propane, nitrogen, water, diesel fuel and rental equipment. The primary costs are the costs of oil sands ore, natural gas liquids, aromatic solvents, and labor costs. Other than the aromatic solvents, the condensate used as both a solvent and a feedstock in the processing operations at our Asphalt Ridge facility is produced by processing natural gas liquids through a distillation column, with aromatic solvents then added to the distillate. In addition:
 

● | Our fixed costs generally remain constant without regard to the API gravity of our upgraded crude oil; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our oil sands ore costs, which include our open pit mining costs, the cost of transporting mined ore to our processing facility, and pre-processing costs (crushing etc.) incurred in preparing mined ore for processing, do not vary with the API gravity of the oil produced at our facility, but will increase over time (subject to economies of scale) as our mining operations expand and oil production increases; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solvent and condensate costs are based on the market prices that exist for each category of product, which are usually determined by a monthly average of prevailing prices in effect during the month of delivery. Solvent and condensate costs typically increase as the target API gravity for our finished crude oil increases (ranging from $2.62/barrel of oil to achieve an API gravity of 15.7 to $16.27/barrel of oil for an API gravity of 42).

In determining our “Average Production Costs” for 2015, our average fixed costs for each barrel of oil produced at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility during the period of August 2015 through December 2015 were: operator labor ($5.31); electricity ($ 0.50), propane ($1.25); nitrogen ($0.21); water ($0.1); diesel fuel ($ 0.25); and rental equipment ($0.79). For our variable costs (expressed for each barrel of oil produced at our facility), our average oil sands ore cost was $4.59 per barrel, the primary component of which was the cost of transporting the mined ore approximately 17 miles from our lease to the original location of our pilot plant, and our average cost for aromatic solvent and condensate was $0.65 and $16.92, respectively.
 
For comparison purposes, during the period of August 2018 through December 2018, our “Average Production Costs” decreased to $27 per barrel of oil produced at our Asphalt Ridge facility. During this period, our fixed costs did not differ materially from our August 2015 to December 2015 fixed costs. We do anticipate that we will experience an increase in fixed costs as we increase our capacity and operate at full capacity.
 
With respect to variable costs, our oil sands ore cost during the 2018 period increased to an average of $6.65 per barrel, due primarily to the quantity of ore processed, but with cost-savings resulting from the relocation of our processing facility to the mine site located within our TMC Mineral Lease. In addition, during the 2018 period, our average cost of aromatic solvent decreased to $0.47 and the average cost of condensate was substantially lower at $2.75, due primarily to our production of heavier oil with an API gravity of between 15 and 25 degrees.
 
We do not expect our operating costs to materially change as the depth of the Asphalt Ridge #1 Mine increases with additional mining over time. We further anticipate that increased efficiencies in our mining operations and various economies of scale (such as bulk quantity purchases of aromatic solvents at quantity/price discounts), will assist in managing and potentially reducing our average production costs as production at our Asphalt Ridge facility increases over time.
 
The API gravity for the raw heavy oil or bitumen extracted from oil sands ores initially treated at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility averages approximately 10 degrees. Through the application of the Extraction Technology at our plant, a new or distinct crude oil is produced having a range of API gravity of between 20 degrees and 35 degrees. Through our solvent formulation and the select distillation capabilities, the plant is able to craft a final crude oil product to meet the specifications of a range of (refinery and pipeline) customers.
 
The finished crude oil produced at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility is currently sold to an independent purchaser under short-term or spot delivery contracts where the purchaser takes delivery of finished crude oil at or near the plant and transports it for resale to a refinery in Nevada. The specifications of the oil produced at the plant are effectively tailored to meet customer (pipeline and refinery) specifications and requirements. From time to time we sell oil produced at our Asphalt Ridge facility pursuant to the terms of product off take agreements However, none of our agreements with our current purchaser and none of the offtake agreements are firm commitments requiring the purchaser to acquire a specified quantity of our produced oil. If we increase our production beyond the needs of our current purchaser, we expect to attempt to find additional purchasers for such additional production. Although we believe that larger production quantities will attract certain purchasers that only purchase larger quantities of product and will require transportation of our products to locations closer to our processing facility, resulting in lower transportation costs, to date we have only had preliminary discussions with such purchasers and have no purchase commitments from such purchasers. If purchasers located closer to our processing facility are not interested in acquiring such additional quantities produced, we may sell our product to purchasers that may require transportation of our products to locations that are further from our processing facility, which would result in higher transportation costs and lower profit margins for us.
 
Generally, the finished oil produced at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility is sold at a price representing a discount off an average of published prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for a specified period.  WTI crude oil is commonly used as a benchmark in pricing oil under oil sales/purchase contracts, particularly in the U.S. The discount off the WTI benchmark price is based on a number of factors, including differences that may exist between the specifications of our crude oil and those of WTI crude oil together with the cost of transporting our crude oil to delivery points. Since WTI crude oil generally has an API gravity of between 37-42 degrees, a heavier oil having a lower API gravity in the range of the oil produced at our processing facility will be valued and sold at a price reflecting a discount off the WTI benchmark price.
 
We anticipate that, as production from our oil sands facility increases, longer term contracts will be secured by PQE Oil utilizing market-based pricing formulas.
 
The SITLA Leases
 
The SITLA Leases have a primary term of ten (10) years, and will remain in effect thereafter for as long as (a) bituminous sands are produced in paying quantities, or (b) PQE Oil is otherwise engaged in diligent operations, exploration or development activity and certain other conditions are satisfied. Generally, the term of the SITLA Leases may not be extended beyond the twentieth year of their effective dates except by production in paying quantities. An annual minimum royalty of $10 an acre must be paid during the first ten years of the SITLA Leases; from and after the 11th year of the leases, the annual minimum royalty may be adjusted by the lessor based on certain “readjustment” provisions in the SITLA Leases. Annual minimum royalties paid in any lease year may be credited against production royalties accruing in the same year.

The BLM Leases
 
In April 2019, TMC acquired an undivided 50% of the operating rights under the BLM Leases, consisting of the right to explore for and produce oil from oil sands formations and deposits from the surface down to a subsurface depth of 1,000 feet. The operating rights assigned and transferred to TMC under certain of the BLM Leases also grant to TMC the right, subject to similar depth limitation, to explore for and produce oil and gas from conventional sources. Each of the BLM Leases includes lands that are located within a “Special Tar Sands Area” or “STSA”, a geographic area that has been designated by the (U.S.) Department of Interior as containing substantial deposits of oil sands.
 
The BLM Leases were originally issued by BLM under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (the “MLA”). However, because the definition of “oil” in the MLA prior to 1981 did not include oil produced from oil sands, the BLM Leases (and all other federal onshore mineral leases issued prior to 1981) did not authorize the development and recovery of oil from oil sands, tar sands and bitumen-impregnated rocks and sediments. The Combined Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of 1981 (“CHL Act”) expanded the definition of “oil” to include oil produced from oil sands and bitumen deposits and authorized the issuance of new “combined hydrocarbon leases” or “CHLs” that permit exploration and production of oil and gas from both conventional sources and from oil sands deposits.
 
For federal onshore mineral leases that were in effect on November 16, 1981 (the CHL Act’s enactment date) and included lands located within an STSA, the CHL Act granted to lessees the right to convert such leases to new CHLs. Upon issuance by BLM, each CHL will constitute a new lease that will remain in effect for a primary term of ten (10) years and thereafter for as long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.
 
Each of the BLM Leases has been included in an application to BLM requesting their conversion to new CHLs. During the pendency of such applications, the term (and any operations) of the BLM Leases are in “suspension status” under BLM regulations until the new CHLs are issued.
 
Summary of Production Royalties Payable
 
Technology Transfer Agreement
 
Pursuant to the terms of a technology transfer agreement dated November 7, 2011 that we entered into with Vladimir Podlipskiy, the developer of the Extraction Technology, we are obligated to pay Mr. Podlipskiy a royalty on production from each processing plant that we own or operate that uses the Extraction Technology, starting with the construction and operation of a second plant. The royalty, if and at such time as it becomes payable, will consist of 2% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is below $60.00 per barrel; 3% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is between $60.00 and $69.99 per barrel; 3.5% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is between $70.00 and $79.99 and 4% of gross sales if the price of heavy oil is greater than $80.00 per barrel.
TMC Mineral Lease
 
Under the TMC Mineral Lease, TMC holds 100% of the working interests (subject to a 1.6 % overriding royalty previously granted to Temple Mountain Energy, Inc.).
 
In addition, TMC is required to make certain advance royalty payments to the lessor. Future advance royalties required are:
 

(i) | From July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020, minimum payments of $100,000 per quarter.

SITLA Leases
 
The SITLA Leases provide that PQE Oil must pay: (i) an annual rent equal to the greater of $1 an acre or a fixed sum of $500 (without regard to acreage); and (ii) a production royalty of 8% of the market price received for products produced from the leases at the point of first sale, less reasonable actual costs of transportation to the point of first sale. After the tenth year of the Leases, the lessor may increase the royalty rate by as much as one percent (1%) per year up to a maximum of 12.5%, subject to a proviso that production royalties under the leases shall never be less than $3.00/bbl during the term of the Leases. As the sole lessee under the SITLA Leases, PQE Oil owns 100% of the working interests under the Leases, subject to payment of annual rentals, advance annual minimum royalties, and production royalties.
 
BLM Leases
 
Under the BLM Leases, production royalties are governed by BLM regulations and are payable to the United States (Department of Interior) at the rate of 12.5% of the amount or value of the production removed and sold. The interests acquired by TMC under the BLM Leases are also subject to a 6.25% overriding royalty reserved by predecessors-in-title.
 
Permits and Taxes
 
On September 15, 2008, a large mining permit was granted to TME Asphalt Ridge, LLC by the State of Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining (“UDOGM”) for the mining and development of the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1, an open pit mine located on land included within the TMC Mineral Lease.
 
On or about July 9, 2015, UDOGM approved an application filed by TMC to transfer the “Notice of Intention to Commence Large Mining Operations” for the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 (Permit # M/047/0089) from TME Asphalt Ridge LLC to TMC. On October 27, 2017, UDOGM granted final approval to TMC’s “Amended Notice of Intention to Commence Large Mining Operations” and issued final Permit # M/047/0089 authorizing TMC to conduct operations at Asphalt Ridge Mine #1. On or about August 6, 2018, PQE Oil filed an amended “Notice of Intention to Commence Large Mining Operations” at the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1, primarily for the purpose of notifying UDOGM that PQE Oil will be the operator under the TMC Mineral Lease and to provide an update on the mining and oil sands processing plan developed by PQE Oil for Asphalt Ridge Mine #1. The August 2018 Notice of Intention to Commence Large Mining Operations has been approved by the UDOGM on July 23, 2019.
 
Mining operations, including the initial development of the mine at the property and removal of the overburden soil layer has already been performed. In addition to the mining permits, all environmental, construction, utility and other local permits necessary for the construction of the plant and the processing of the oil sands have been granted to PQE.
 
Specifically, a Groundwater Discharge Permit was issued by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (Division of Water Quality, Water Quality Board) (“UDEQ”), on July 26, 2016 (expiration on July 27, 2021), covering disposal of tailings from ore sands produced from the land area encompassed by the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1. This permit was required by Utah law even though our processing facility does not use a water-based process and authorizes a return of residual sand tailings to the mine for backfill and capping. A Small Source Registration air permit was issued by UDEQ by a letter dated November 2, 2018. The letter confirms that our processing facility at Asphalt Ridge is exempt from any requirement of additional air quality permits since the facility produces less emissions than the level that would require a special air permit. A Conditional Use Permit (“CUP”) was issued by the Uintah County (Utah) Commission to us on January 29, 2018, for the operation of our current processing facility. The CUP is a right/interest in land under Utah law and will continue in effect in perpetuity. A local business license was issued to PQE Oil by the Uintah County Commission on November 19, 2018. The business license must be renewed annually on payment of a license renewal fee.

The oil and gas properties (including plants, equipment etc.) included in or under the TMC Mineral Lease are subject to the State of Utah’s property (ad valorem) tax. The actual tax rate is established by each county in the State (and therefore may vary) and is generally assessed against the “fair market value” of the property. Under Utah Code § 59-2-1103, the oil and gas properties included in the SITLA Leases are exempt from the State’s property (ad valorem) tax (although this exemption does not apply to improvements on state lands).
 
Under Utah Code § 59-5-120, beginning January 1, 2006 and ending June 30, 2026, no severance (production) tax will be imposed on oil and gas produced from oil sands (tar sands). Accordingly, severance tax will not be owed to the State of Utah on the production of oil and hydrocarbon substances from the TMC Mineral Lease or the SITLA Leases until after June 30, 2026.
 
Extraction Technology
 
PQE intends to continue to develop its operations by processing purchased native oil sands ore, as well as native oil sands ore produced through the mining operations of its subsidiary (TMC) using its patented closed loop, continuous flow, scalable and environmentally safe Extraction Technology. The Extraction Technology process allows the extraction of hydrocarbons from a wide range of both “water- wet” and/or “oil-wet” oil sands deposits and other hydrocarbon sediment types. PQE’s oil extraction process takes place in a completely closed loop system that continuously recirculates and recycles the solvent after it has completely separated the asphaltene and heavy oils from the oil sands. The closed loop system is capable of recovering over 99% of all hydrocarbons from the oil sands, making this technology very environmentally friendly. The only two end products of the process are high quality heavy oil and clean sand.
 
The Extraction Technology, which has been modified since 2015 and unlike the technology utilized in 2015, utilizes no water in the process, is anticipated to produce no greenhouse gases, requires no high temperature and/or pressure for the extraction process, and expects to extract up to 99% of all hydrocarbon content and recycle up to 99% of the solvents. The proprietary solvent composition consists of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and polycyclic hydrocarbons. It is expected to dissolve up to 99% of heavy bitumen/asphalt and other lighter hydrocarbons from the oil sands, and prevent their precipitation during the extraction process. Solvents used in this composition form an azeotropic mixture which has a low boiling point of 70 – 75 C degrees and it is expected to allow recycling of over 99% of the solvent. These features, in the event they produce as anticipated by PQE, make it possible to perform hydrocarbon extraction from oil sands at mild temperatures of 50 – 60 degrees C, with no vacuum or/and pressure applied that would lead to high energy and economic efficiency of the extraction of oil from the overall oil sands extraction process.
 
In the oil extraction and upgrade process utilized at our Asphalt Ridge processing facility, the bitumen crude oil that we extract from mined oil sands (used as a primary feedstock) has an average API gravity of 10 degrees.
 
No diluents or blending agents are used to reduce the viscosity of the heavy oil extracted from bitumen saturated ores. Instead, varying amounts of solvent (which we distill from natural gas condensate, ordinary chemicals, and recycled solvent) are introduced into an extraction tank containing raw oil sands ore that has been crushed prior to being added to the extraction tank. The solvent is designed to release the crude oil from bitumen-saturated sandstones during the initial extraction process. This process yields an unfinished crude oil containing the solvent and a second residual consisting of clean sand (that contains virtually no hydrocarbons).
 
The unfinished crude oil containing solvent is then introduced or subjected to a simple distillation process where, as the temperature is increased to certain boiling points, virtually all of the solvent is recovered and recycled for future use and the hydrocarbons contained in the unfinished oil are manipulated. During this process – and depending on the API gravity target of the customer – as temperatures are increased, a greater number of increasingly longer hydrocarbon chains are removed (starting with shorter chains of light hydrocarbons and moving to longer heavier hydrocarbon chains having higher boiling points), resulting in a finished crude oil having a higher API gravity (and requiring larger quantities of solvent/condensate in the process). Conversely, at lower temperatures, the solvent and lighter hydrocarbon chains are removed and recycled for future use, resulting in a lower API gravity finished crude oil (and requiring smaller quantities of solvent/condensate in the process).
 
The finished crude oil produced and sold to our customers, for purposes of disclosure under the SEC’s classifications, qualifies as a “synthetic crude oil”. However, the finished oil that we produce is not bitumen and contains virtually no residual solvents or synthetic compounds, is not a blend of separate oils or hydrocarbon products and does not contain diluent. Instead, our finished oil is produced by the extraction, processing and refinement of natural petroleum and is not manufactured by synthesis or with feedstocks that contain or utilize synthetic compounds. For that reason, we market the finished oil that we produce as an upgraded crude oil, a distinct oil product consisting of naturally occurring hydrocarbons and having its own specifications.
 
The oil extraction process has a reboiler, vapors vessel, heat exchangers, air fin condenser, and an oil heater plus a propane tank as the energy source. The reboiler and vapor vessel are used to recycle the solvent. The oil-solvent mixture is subject to increased temperatures in the reboiler to the solvent’s boiling temperature(s), overheated vapors travel through the vapor vessel into the condenser and the solvents are condensed back into a liquid in the air fin cooler/condenser and returned (recycled) back to the process.
 
During the recovery of the solvent through the distillation process, the plant’s engineering and technical personnel are able to select the hydrocarbon chains in the condensate/solvent that are to be flashed off and recovered for recycled reuse in the plant, which in turn produces a crafted finished crude oil. In other words, by selectively stripping or flashing off different hydrocarbon chains from the solvent (whether it be heavier hydrocarbons such as C7 heptanes or C8 octane, or lighter hydrocarbons such as C5 pentane or C6 hexane, plant personnel are able, by design, to use the condensate component of the solvent as a feedstock to produce a relatively sweet heavy to medium crude oil (with an API gravity in the 20-30 degree range) or a sweet lighter crude oil (with an API gravity in the 30-40 degree range). The final product is a distinct crude oil, having its own specifications, produced through the processing and distillation of hydrocarbons derived from two feedstocks: (a) crude bitumen oil or heavy oil extracted from native oil sands, and (b) natural gas condensate.
 
10

 

As part of a hydrocarbon refining process utilizing basic chemistry, the natural gas condensate used in the solvent serves dual functions of (1) a solvent that effectively causes a release of heavy oil from the bitumen-saturated stream, and (2) a feedstock that, through distillation with a primary feedstock consisting of the raw heavy oil or bitumen stream extracted from raw oil sands ores, produces a finished crude oil product. The solvent that is not recovered in the refining process effectively acts as a feedstock to produce the crude oil.
 
While the initial tests of the Extraction Technology in 2015 did not include recycling of solvents, we believe that recent improvements to this technology will achieve the recovery/recycling of over 99% of the solvent and between 50% and 99% of the natural gas condensate. This was based, among other things, on the results of tests previously conducted internally and with third parties at PQE’s laboratory in San Diego using different batches of heavy oil extracted from oil sands in a solvent-extraction process. The actual amount of natural gas condensate recovered/recycled is expected to vary depending upon the API gravity of the finished oil that we elect to produce. Using our Extraction Technology, the production of oil having a higher API gravity will consume more condensate and recycle/recover less condensate.
 
Another key element of our Extraction Technology is that it applies its own extractor using a proprietary/patented “liquid fluidized bed” solvent extraction system for bitumen/oil impregnated in oil sands. A “liquid fluidized bed” style reactor is anticipated to provide continuous mixing of the (liquid) solvent and the solid ore particles. It is intended to allow a continuous flow process with optimal material/mass/energy balances. The Extraction Technology uses only a fraction of the energy needed to produce a barrel of oil when compared with the water-based technologies used in Canada. PQE’s process also employs multiple energy saving technologies to reduce energy consumption. This has resulted in a high level of energy efficiency in the oil extraction process that we use in our Asphalt Ridge processing facility. PQE’s patented design also includes exceptionally efficient heat exchange and distillation/rectification systems. This energy efficiency should significantly improve the economics involved in operating our processing facility.
 
PQE has received patents in the United States, Canada and Russia that protect the claims and processes embodied in the Extraction Technology. See “Intellectual Property” below.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
On March 27, 2013, PQE entered into an intellectual property license agreement in a private arm’s length transaction with a Canadian company, TS Energy Ltd., which has agreed to act as the sole and exclusive licensee of the Extraction Technology within Canada and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.
 
On July 2, 2019, PQE entered into an intellectual property license agreement with Valkor LLC, a company based in Katy, Texas, for the non-exclusive, non-transferable use of the Extraction Technology worldwide (subject to any exclusive license agreements in effect) in the engineering, construction and operation of oil sands extraction plants. The agreement requires Valkor to invest (or secure investment of) a minimum of US$20 million towards the construction of an oilsands plant by December 2020, and to have in production a minimum of 1,000 barrels per day. The agreement also requires Valkor to pay a one-time non-refundable license fee of US$2 million per oil sands plant commissioned, with 50% payable upon start of construction and the remainder payable upon first production. The agreement further provides that Valkor will pay a five percent (5%) royalty based on annual gross sales for so long as the licensed technology is covered by a valid claim in the country in which it is used.
 
We rely upon patents to protect our intellectual property. We have obtained patents in the United States, Canada and Russia that protect the Extraction Technology. The following sets forth details of our issued patents.

THE OIL SANDS MARKET
 
As an unconventional hydrocarbon resource, oil sands hold hundreds of billions of barrels of oil on a worldwide basis. Although Canada is the only country that is currently extracting large quantities of oil from its oil sands deposits, the United States also has large oil sands resources that can be developed. In a 2007 Report entitled “A Technical, Economic, and Legal Assessment of North American Oil Shale, Oil Sands, and Heavy Oil Resources In Response to Energy Policy Act of 2005 Section 369(p)” (September 2007), prepared by the Utah Heavy Oil Program, Institute For Clean and Secure Energy and The University of Utah for the U.S. Department of Energy (the “2007 Report”), the authors reported the following estimates, which estimates were based upon source material published in 1979, 1987 and 1993:

● | The United States has an estimated 76 billion barrels of oil-in-place (“OIP”) (OIP are not estimates of reserves or recoverable resources) from bitumen and heavy oil contained in oil sands resources;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the United States, Utah is known to have the largest oil sands deposits, with total resource estimates ranging from 23 to 32 billion barrels of OIP from bitumen and heavy oil contained in oil sands formations and deposits; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Within the state of Utah, the region that has experienced the most oil sands development, both in terms of existing oil production and supporting infrastructure, is the Asphalt Ridge area located on the northern edge of the Uintah Basin in eastern Utah. In the 2007 Report, it is estimated that about one (1) billion barrels of OIP exist in the form of bitumen and heavy oil contained in oil sands formations and deposits in the Asphalt Ridge area. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
From our own investigation of the oil sands deposits in the Asphalt Ridge area of Utah, we believe that a substantial part of the oil sands deposits in this area are accessible through outcroppings or in shallow depths with limited or no overburden. In our view, the location and accessibility of oil sands deposits in Asphalt Ridge create an opportunity for commercial development, supported by positive economics, using surface mining techniques and our extraction technology.
 
The worldwide growing demand for heavy crude oil and the recent decline in heavy crude oil production in countries such as Venezuela makes the high quality, low sulfur, heavy oil found in oil sands deposits in the United States a valuable resource that has been underdeveloped to date. The development of “tight shale” oil plays in the United States has produced significant quantities of light, sweet crude oil reserves, but heavy oil development in the United States has lagged. The development of oil sands domestically has the potential to turn the United States into a major supplier of heavy oil to world markets. To date, oil sands development has been limited by the absence of a viable technology that can extract heavy oil and bitumen from the oil sands deposits in an economical and environmentally responsible manner. To that end, PQE has developed and patented an extraction technology that aims to develop oil sands reserves in an economical and environmentally responsible manner. PQE is currently expanding its commercial oil sands extraction operations in the Asphalt Ridge area, utilizing a process that is economical, environmentally friendly and produces high quality heavy oil.
 
We have tested our Extraction Technology both at Asphalt Ridge and with oil sands sourced from different parts of the world and having different hydrocarbon chemical compositions. To date, we have conducted tests with oil sands from Russia, China, Indonesia and the Middle East. Our tests with Russian oil sands, which were the only tests of our Extraction Technology with oil sands from different parts of the world that were conducted by third parties, were conducted in Ufa, Bashkorkostan (Russia) by a third party (KVADRA) retained by us to perform the tests using a multi-ton pilot plant, used the local oil sands ore with oil saturation in a range of 7-10%, and resulted in industrial quantities of heavy oil. From the tests conducted in Ufa, an average of 70 metric tons of raw oil sands material were processed per day resulting in 5,475 kg of heavy asphaltenic oil per day. Other tests, consisting of oil sands samples from China, Indonesia and Jordan, were conducted internally at PQE’s laboratory in San Diego using lab bench testing with our own solvent blend that produced approximately one to two pound quantities. By introducing the solvent mixture to crushed and treated ore containing bitumen oil, the oil was separated by recycling the solvent with a laboratory-scale rotor vacuum evaporator. Sand tailings were separated by centrifugation and dried under the vacuum.
 
Through our testing of oil sands sourced from different countries, we found that the efficiency and consistency of PQE’s extraction technology are not affected by differences in the chemical composition of the oil/bitumen in the oil sands. Despite relatively significant differences in oil/bitumen chemistry, both the efficiency and consistency of our extraction technology remained intact, resulting in an oil recovery efficiency that in each test exceeded 99%. We believe that this testing demonstrates that the Extraction Process is universal in its application and does not depend on the material source or the hydrocarbon content or fingerprint.

PETROBLOQ LLC
 
In November 2017, we formed a subsidiary Petrobloq LLC to focus on developing digital supply chain management solutions. Petrobloq has entered into an agreement with First Bitcoin Capital Corp. (“FBCC”), a global developer of blockchain-based applications, to design and develop a blockchain-powered supply chain management platform for the oil and gas industry. The platform is being designed to be a “one-stop shop” that will provide both small and large oil and gas producers and operators with the ability to customize their own distributed ledger modules that will permit each company, in a secure “closed” environment, to document, track, and account for the supply of equipment, materials and services in project, field, and lease development. The agreement with FBCC requires that Petroteq pay FBCC $500,000 for the services to be provided, of which $252,500 has been paid.
 
The supply chain management platform is currently in early stage development and we are in the process of continuing research and development activities. The current development plans are that the platform will be blockchain agnostic and able to run on any blockchain that is commercially available. The Company’s business does not entail, and it is not anticipated that it will entail, the creation, issuance, or use of any digital assets.
 
In February 2018, Petrobloq leased an 1,800 square foot office in Calabasas, California. The office is staffed with four contract employees hired by FBCC serving as Project Manager; Director of Operations, Solutions Architect and Senior Database Developer, respectively.
 
In June 2018 and September 2018, we entered into statements of work with MehzOhanian, a software engineering firm based in Austin, Texas, to develop blockchain applications for Petrobloq. MetzOhanian specializes in blockchain engineering, supply chain management software development, and digital security consulting. MetzOhanian will be working with Petrobloq to develop blockchain applications aimed at increasing supply chain transparency and efficiency in the oil and gas sector. The statements of work entered into on June 5, 2018 was for services to be provided from June 5, 2018 until August 10, 2018 and the statement of work entered into on September 24, 2018 is for services to be provided between October 1, 2018 and October 1, 2019. The services are provided on an hourly basis and the estimated cost of the services to be provided under the second statement of work is $129,850.
 
OTHER INVESTMENTS
 
In addition, we own a 44.7% interest in Accord GR Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Accord”), which uses two oil enhanced recovery technologies that it licenses from one of its affiliated entities to conduct oil and gas production activities. We also own a 25% interest in Recruiter.com Oil and Gas Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Recruiter. OGG”), a recruitment venture that provides a website focused on careers in the oil and gas industry. Due to the lack of activity in both Accord and Recruiter.OGG, our investment in each has been fully written off on our balance sheet for the year ended August 31, 2019.

REGULATION
 
Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells. Full mining permits have been granted to PQE Oil from the State of Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining for the mining and development of the Asphalt Ridge Mine #1 located in the Asphalt Ridge area of Utah. In addition to the mining permits, all environmental, construction, utility and other local permits necessary for the construction of the plant and the processing of the oil sands have been granted to PQE Oil. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.
 
Typically, oil enhancements such as hydraulic fracturing operations are overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where EPA is the permitting authority. As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for our operations. These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive. In addition, legislation introduced in Congress provides for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and requires the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids. Moreover, on November 23, 2011, the EPA announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. Further, on May 4, 2012, the BLM issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian land.
 
On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. In addition, gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment (e.g., flaring) by October 15, 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line. Further, the final rules under NESHAP include maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for “small” glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves. Compliance with these requirements, especially the imposition of these green completion requirements, may require modifications to certain of our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
 
In addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states such as Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana and Montana, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas adopted rules in December 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, Pennsylvania’s Act 13 of 2012 became law on February 14, 2012 and amended the state’s Oil and Gas Act to impose an impact fee for drilling, increase setbacks from certain water sources, require water management plans, increase civil penalties, strengthen the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s (PaDEP) authority over the issuance of drilling permits, and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids.
 
We believe that the technologies we use are cleaner and environmentally friendlier than the known fracking or tar sand technologies. Regulatory and social resistance sometimes prohibits fracking recovery methods in some states and we intend to consider entering in those states with our technologies offering to the regulators and the public solutions that we believe would help to lift the bans and ease resistance to oil and gas field development.
 
OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations.
 
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and comparable state laws. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Also, pursuant to OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.

Oil Pollution Act.
 
The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. The term “waters of the United States” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. We believe that we are in compliance with the OPA and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder in the conduct of our operations.
Clean Water Act.
 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are primarily implemented through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States. Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges. We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related federal and state regulations.
COMPETITION
 
Competition in the oil industry is intense. We compete with other companies seeking to acquire sub economic oil fields, many with substantial financial and other resources. We will also compete with technologies such as gas injection, polymer flooding, microbial injection and thermal methods. As a new technology, we also compete with many of the other technologies that have been proven to be economically successful in enhancing oil production in the United States. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to attract the necessary funding or qualified personnel. If we are unable to successfully compete for funding or for qualified personnel, our activities may be slowed, suspended or terminated, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations. However due to the innovative nature of our technology and the ecological benefit it provides, while remaining economically efficient, we believe that competition will not be a significant impediment to our operations or expansion.
IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and therefore we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common shares pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with that term in the JOBS Act.
ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES
 
We are a company incorporated in Ontario, Canada. Certain of our directors and officers named in this registration statement reside outside the U.S. In addition, some of our assets and the assets of our directors and officers are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors who reside in the United States to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States. You may also have difficulty enforcing, both in and outside the United States, judgments you may obtain in U.S. courts against us or these persons in any action, including actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.
 
Furthermore, there is substantial doubt whether an action could be brought in Canada in the first instance predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Canadian courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws against us or these persons on the grounds that Canada is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. Even if a Canadian court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Canadian law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Canadian law.

On October 15, 2012, MCW Energy Group Limited (“MCW NB”), a corporation incorporated in the Province of New Brunswick, completed a reverse acquisition of AXEA Capital Corp. (the “RTO”) and as a result MCW NB became a wholly owned subsidiary of AXEA Capital Corp. which also changed its name from “AXEA Capital Corp.” to “MCW Enterprises Ltd.” Pursuant to articles of continuance filed on December 7, 2012, MCW NB changed its jurisdiction of governance by continuing from the Province of New Brunswick into the Province of Ontario. Pursuant to articles of continuance filed on December 12, 2012, MCW Enterprises Ltd. changed its jurisdiction of governance by continuing from the Province of British Columbia into the Province of Ontario and changed its name to MCW Enterprises Continuance Ltd.
