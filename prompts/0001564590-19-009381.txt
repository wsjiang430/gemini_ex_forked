Overview
 aTyr Pharma is a biotherapeutics company engaged in the discovery and clinical development of innovative medicines based on novel immunological pathways. We have concentrated our research and development efforts on a newly discovered area of biology, the extracellular functionality of tRNA synthetases. Built on more than a decade of foundational science on extracellular tRNA synthetase biology and its effect on immune responses, we have built a global intellectual property estate directed to all 20 human tRNA synthetases.  
 Within our synthetase platform, we are primarily focused on the therapeutic translation of the Resokine pathway, comprised of extracellular proteins derived from the histidyl tRNA synthetase (HARS) gene family, one of the 20 tRNA synthetase genes. Our clinical stage product candidate, ATYR1923, is a fusion protein comprised of the immuno-modulatory domain of HARS fused to the FC region of a human antibody. ATYR1923 is also a selective modulator of Neuropilin-2 (NRP-2) that downregulates the innate and adaptive immune response in inflammatory disease states. We are developing ATYR1923 as a potential therapeutic for patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), a group of immune-mediated disorders that cause progressive fibrosis of the lung tissue.  We selected pulmonary sarcoidosis as our first ILD indication and initiated a Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in December 2018. The study has been designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of multiple doses of ATYR1923 and to evaluate established clinical endpoints and certain biomarkers to assess preliminary activity of ATYR1923. The results of this study will guide future development of ATYR1923 in pulmonary sarcoidosis and provide insight for the potential of ATYR1923 in other ILDs, such as chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) and connective tissue disease ILD (CTD-ILD). 
 In conjunction with our clinical development of ATYR1923, we have in parallel been expanding our knowledge of tRNA synthetases and NRP-2 receptor biology through both industry and academic collaborations. In March 2019, we entered into a research collaboration and option agreement with CSL Behring for the development of product candidates derived from up to four tRNA synthetases from our preclinical pipeline. Under the terms of the collaboration, CSL Behring will fund all research and development activities and will pay a total of $4.25 million per synthetase program ($17 million if all four synthetase programs advance) in option fees based on achievement of research milestones and CSL’s determination to continue development. In January 2019, we expanded a successful pilot study and entered into a research agreement with the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and Dr. Kaustubh Datta, who has published extensively in the field of NRP-2 biology, will serve as the investigator for the research collaboration.  We are also working closely with other collaborators and academia to further research in these areas.

Strategy 
 Key elements of our strategy include the following:
 Develop ATYR1923 to address unmet medical needs within interstitial lung diseases. We believe that by establishing proof-of-concept in pulmonary sarcoidosis, we can gain insight to the potential of ATYR1923 in other ILDs, such as CHP and CTD-ILD.  Our resources are devoted to completing our ATYR1923 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and, if that trial is successful, we believe we can expedite development of ATYR1923 for pulmonary sarcoidosis towards regulatory approval.  In addition, success in our ATYR1923 Phase 1b/2a trial, could give us the opportunity to potentially launch additional Phase 2 clinical trials for both CHP and CTD-ILD.
 Expand our knowledge on the therapeutic potential of NRP-2 receptor biology by utilizing our leadership position in this emerging area of biology. NRP-2 receptor biology has the potential to downregulate the innate and adaptive immune response in inflammatory disease states and may represent a new drug target. We are committed to translating this groundbreaking area of newly discovered biology to therapeutic applications, both with our internal research and through academic collaborations, such as the research agreement with UNMC.
 Build a diverse pipeline of biologics based on our understanding of extracellular tRNA synthetase biology.  We continue to deepen our expertise in production of biologic product candidates based on tRNA synthetases with the goal of developing programs with multiple therapeutic modalities.  We will work with both industry and academic collaborators to further product development in this area. Our collaboration with CSL Behring will explore the potential to develop programs from up to four additional tRNA synthetases from our preclinical pipeline.  
 ATYR1923
 Overview of ATYR1923
 We are initially developing ATYR1923 as a potential therapeutic for patients with ILD, a group of immune-mediated disorders that cause progressive fibrosis of the lung tissue. ATYR1923 is a selective modulator of NRP-2 that downregulates the innate and adaptive immune response in inflammatory disease states. We announced data from a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of ATYR1923 in June 2018. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of intravenous ATYR1923 in 36 healthy volunteers. The results indicate that the drug was generally well-tolerated at all dose levels tested, with no significant adverse events and the observed PK profile supports the potential for a once-monthly dosing regimen.
In parallel with the Phase 1 clinical trial, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of ATYR1923 in a number of preclinical models of lung injury and inflammation in rodents. For example, we presented the positive results of ATYR1923 in a mouse bleomycin lung injury model and a rat bleomycin lung injury model at the 2017 and 2018 American Thoracic Society Annual Meetings, respectively. In addition, we presented positive findings of ATYR1923 in a sclerodermatous chronic graft versus host disease model at the Scleroderma Foundation’s 2018 National Patient Conference. A comprehensive review of this data in consultation with key opinion leaders led to our selection of pulmonary sarcoidosis as the first ILD indication for our ATYR1923 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial program.
 We initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of ATYR1923 in 36 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in December 2018. This Phase 1b/2a study is a multiple-ascending dose, placebo-controlled, first-in-patient study of ATYR1923 that has been designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and PK profile of multiple doses of ATYR1923. In addition, we intend to evaluate its steroid sparing effect and other established clinical endpoints along with potential biomarkers to assess preliminary activity of ATYR1923.
 Background and Mechanism of Action
 The ATYR1923 program was initiated to leverage our knowledge of the Resokine pathway to develop a therapeutic which would possess the N-terminal immuno-modulatory activities of HARS.
 The Resokine family of proteins is derived from the HARS gene via proteolysis or alternative splicing. We believe these splice variants are important modulators of innate and adaptive immune activation. Proteins derived from the HARS gene, including both full-length and splice variants, are present in circulation. We refer to the extracellular HARS proteins as Resokine, to differentiate them from the intracellular enzyme involved in protein synthesis. Our scientists were the first to discover the novel immunomodulatory role of the Resokine pathway.
 The gene for HARS gives rise to a number of splice variants, and though most of these have lost their catalytic activity, many retain the N-terminal domain (iMod domain). This N-terminal domain was appended to HARS during evolutionary development of multicellular organisms and is not essential for protein synthetic activity, is not generally found in prokaryotic organisms, and is 
 5

retained with high homology across mammalian species.  Alternative splicing of HARS may be differentially regulated during cellular growth and differentiation, unlike the constitutive high level expression of the full length protein, suggesting that these splice variants may play a differential role in growth and cellular development.
 Recently, significant progress has been made in elucidating the role of extracellular HARS derived proteins, including the identification of a putative cellular receptor of the iMod domain through screening via cell microarray. After screening, two NRP-2 isoforms – (Neuropilin 2A and 2B) were identified as convincing and specific binding partners of the iMod domain. Interactions of HARS with NRP-2 appear to be specifically mediated by the iMod domain of HARS, and binding of the iMod domain of HARS is specific to NRP-2 over NRP-1, and the binding to NRP-2 by other iMod domain containing amino acyl tRNA synthetases is not observed. The discovery of the Resokine/NRP-2 axis represents a previously unknown mechanism of biological regulation, which may act as a homeostatic regulator of several cellular processes mediated through the neuropilin receptor. The deregulation of these processes may lead to a spectrum of diseases, which could be selectively targeted by modulating the Resokine/NRP-2 axis to address the underlying disease etiology.
 NRP-2 is a pleiotropic co-receptor participating in a broad array of biological pathways including, immunomodulation, lymphangiogenesis, neuronal development and remodeling, cellular growth, migration and differentiation, and cancer development. These biological processes are mediated through a complex interplay of several signaling systems including the semaphorins/plexin receptor family, the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 receptor family, as well as integrin signaling pathways. Growing evidence indicates that NRP-2 influences myeloid cell biology such as activation and recruitment to inflammatory sites. For instance, NRP-2 expression on alveolar macrophages regulates airway inflammatory responses to inhaled LPS (Immormino et al. Neuropilin-2 Regulates Airway Inflammatory Responses to Inhaled Lipopolysaccharide.  Am J Physiol 315:L202-L211. 2018).
 ATYR1923 development builds upon our understanding of the biology of the extracellular activity of HARS. This novel molecular entity acts as a selective modulator of NRP-2 downregulating the innate and adaptive immune response in inflammatory disease states. ATYR1923 is a fusion protein comprised of the immuno-modulatory domain of HARS fused to the FC region of a human antibody. 
 Preclinical Development
 Our preclinical development estate of translational animal models were selected to help inform and de-risk clinical development of ATYR1923. We have evaluated the biological activity and safety of ATYR1923 across a diverse set of experimental lung disease models, as well as in normal animals, looking for signals of activity and potential biomarkers, while confirming tolerability and a favorable safety profile.
 Bleomycin-Induced Lung Injury in Mice
 ATYR1923 significantly reduced lung fibrosis and inflammation in two bleomycin-induced lung injury models in mice. The bleomycin-induced lung injury model has been used as a translational model previously in the development of therapeutics for ILD, including the drugs pirfenidone, or Esbriet®, and nintedanib, or Ofev®, which were both approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2014 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). ATYR1923 administered therapeutically in this model drives activity comparable to or greater than pirfenidone, anti-TGF antibodies, and dexamethasone. These preclinical experiments were presented in a poster at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Congress in Washington D.C. in May 2017. 
 Bleomycin-Induced Lung Injury in Rats
 ATYR1923 significantly reduced lung fibrosis and inflammation and improved lung function in a bleomycin-induced lung injury model in rats. The rat bleomycin-induced model allows for analysis of functional endpoints, such as breathing rate, which is not possible in mice. Data demonstrated that ATYR1923, administered starting on Day 1 or Day 9, returned lung function to normal as measured by respiratory minute volume, a measure of breathing rate that is exacerbated in inflammatory conditions. In contrast, nintedanib was ineffective at reducing both fibrosis and interstitial/alveolar inflammation in these animals. These results may indicate that treatment with ATYR1923 during an inflammatory phase of the model may be beneficial for reducing inflammation-dependent fibrosis. This experiment was presented in a poster at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Congress in San Diego, CA in May 2018.
 Sclerodermatous Chronic Graft vs. Host Disease Model in Mice
 ATYR1923 significantly reduced measures of lung and skin fibrosis in a sclerodermatous chronic graft vs host disease model in mice, with early administration. We employed a minor histocompatibility antigen mismatched model which has been reported to mimic many of the pathological symptoms of human disease. Weekly intravenous treatment with ATYR1923, at 0.4 mg/kg, was compared with daily oral nintedanib, at 60 mg/kg, with administration beginning at Day 7 for early intervention or at Day 21 for late intervention.

ATYR1923, beginning on Day 7, exhibited robust and consistent therapeutic activity in both skin and lung, demonstrated by significantly decreased dermal thickness in the skin and histological fibrosis or Ashcroft score in the lungs in comparison to the untreated controls. The number of myofibroblasts and amount of hydroxyproline (i.e., collagen) content was also significantly reduced in both organs. Observed effects with weekly dosing of ATYR1923 were similar to those observed with daily dosing of nintedanib. Late intervention with ATYR1923 at 0.4 mg/kg was not significantly effective with this dosing paradigm, consistent with our hypothesis that ATYR1923 may be most active during the active inflammatory phase of disease. In this model the damage to both lung and skin is indirect from a systemic GvHD reaction, and yet we observed consistent therapeutic activity with ATYR1923, supporting our therapeutic hypothesis that ATYR1923 can downregulate the immune response and inflammation following tissue injury and prevent progression to fibrosis, which presents an attractive drug profile for treating ILD. 
 Data from this model was presented at the Scleroderma Foundation National Patient Education Conference in Philadelphia, PA in July 2018. The results from this systemic disease model are consistent with direct lung injury models presented previously at ATS in 2017 and in 2018. 
 Based on our translational biology program, with activity across distinct animal models either driven by direct lung injury or systemic pathology, along with our understanding of the ATYR1923 and NRP-2 interaction and the cell types involved in the mechanism of action of our drug, we decided to move the program forward into patient trials. A comprehensive review of this translational data in consultation with key opinion leaders led to our selection of pulmonary sarcoidosis as the first ILD indication for our ATYR1923 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial program.
 Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs), Pulmonary Sarcoidosis, and the Role of Immunology
 ILDs are a group of immune-mediated disorders which cause progressive fibrosis of lung tissue. There are over 100 different types of ILD, of which the four major forms are: pulmonary sarcoidosis, connective tissue disease-associated ILD (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis ILD and systemic sclerosis-associated ILD) (CTD-ILD), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Among the various forms of ILD, we have focused on several that result in severe and progressive lung disease and share immune-pathophysiology features that have the potential to be impacted by ATYR1923 as demonstrated in our preclinical models. These lung conditions are recognized as having a measurable immune component involving both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that contribute to pathogenesis at several cellular and non-cellular levels, and can result in progressive disease leading to fibrosis and death. The first ILD that we are focusing on clinically is pulmonary sarcoidosis. 
 The immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis is not yet well understood. A leading hypothesis is that granuloma formation involves the interplay between antigen, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules, and T-cell receptors: a presumptive sarcoid antigen is engulfed by circulating antigen-presenting cells (APCs; macrophages, dendritic cells) and the subsequent interplay between APCs and CD4+ T-cells initiates granuloma formation. T lymphocyte activation subsequently plays a crucial role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis.
 Sarcoidosis affects people of all ages, but typically presents before the age of 50 years, with the incidence peaking at 20 to 39 years. The disorder usually begins in the lungs, skin or lymph nodes, but can affect almost any organ.  Sarcoidosis in the lungs is called pulmonary sarcoidosis and 90% or more of patients with sarcoidosis have lung involvement. Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a major form of ILD. Estimates of prevalence vary; however, we believe that approximately 200,000 Americans live with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The prognosis for patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis ranges from benign and self-limiting to chronic, debilitating fibrotic disease and mortality.
 For patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, the primary goal of treatment is typically to improve the patient’s quality of life, while secondarily managing the inflammation associated with the granulomas that could lead to the development of more permanent fibrosis and impairment of pulmonary function. ATYR1923 may provide a therapeutic benefit in pulmonary sarcoidosis by providing an immunomodulatory function to help resolve inflammation. Moreover, the mechanism of action of ATYR1923 in T-cells and macrophages potentially overlaps with the cellular pathology observed in pulmonary sarcoidosis. In preclinical studies, ATYR1923 has been observed to inhibit cytokines involved in regulation of inflammatory and immune responses and attenuate T-cell activation, while also modulating macrophage endosome maturation. Related to our mechanistic studies, we have also discovered that NRP-2 is up-regulated during activation of myeloid cells including macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils, and that ATYR1923 can bind to NRP-2 on these cell types. Furthermore, ATYR1923 has been observed to significantly reduce inflammation-dependent pulmonary fibrosis and improve respiratory function parameters in bleomycin-induced animal models of ILD, particularly when administered during the inflammatory phase of the disease. Accordingly, based on these data, we believe that by inhibiting the inflammatory portion of the fibrotic cascade, ATYR1923 could provide a safer, potentially more effective alternative with less toxic effects as compared to oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive therapies for patients with symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis and prevent progression to fibrosis.

Clinical Development
 ATYR1923 Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 In June 2018, we announced results of our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of ATYR1923 conducted in Australia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK of intravenous (IV) ATYR1923 in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study enrolled 36 healthy volunteers who were randomized to one of six sequential cohorts and received a single infusion of intravenous ATYR1923 or placebo. Ascending ATYR1923 doses by cohort ranged from 0.03 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg. The results indicate that the drug was generally well-tolerated at all dose levels tested, with no significant adverse events or induction of anti-drug antibodies observed following ATYR1923 dosing or throughout the one-month follow-up period. The PK of ATYR1923 following single-dose administration were linear across the evaluated dose range. Higher ATYR1923 doses yielded sustained serum concentrations through the end of the one-month follow-up period that were above the predicted therapeutic threshold, supporting the potential for a once-monthly dosing regimen.
 In parallel, as described above we expanded our knowledge of the therapeutic potential of ATYR1923 by conducting several in vivo and in vitro models to further elucidate its potential clinical utility. These translational research data, as well as the Phase 1 clinical trial results and discussions with key opinion leaders, helped to guide our development plans for ATYR1923.  In September 2018, we announced pulmonary sarcoidosis as the indication for our next study.
 ATYR1923 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial
 We initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for ATYR1923 in December 2018 following FDA acceptance of our investigational new drug application (IND) filed in October 2018.  The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending dose, first-in-patient study with IV ATYR1923 in 36 patients. The study is being conducted in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis undergoing an oral corticosteroids (OCS) tapering regimen, in three cohorts of 12 patients each, at dose levels of 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg.
 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of ATYR1923. Secondary objectives include assessment of the potential steroid-sparing effects of ATYR1923. In addition, ATYR1923 PK and immunogenicity following multiple dose administration will be evaluated. Additional endpoints of interest include the exploratory assessment of the efficacy of ATYR1923 for the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis by evaluating changes over time in: lung imaging; lung function assessed by percent predicted FVC (FVC%) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO); serum biomarkers of interest; health-related quality of life assessments and questionnaires; and measurement of skin lesions (for patients with cutaneous involvement at baseline).
 This study consists of three staggered dose cohorts. Each cohort will consist of three periods: a screening period, a 20-week placebo-controlled treatment period, and a four-week follow-up period ending with final study assessments at Week 24. Within each cohort, 12 patients will be randomized 2:1 to ATYR1923 (N=8) or placebo (N=4). Study drug will be administered via IV infusion every four weeks for a total of six doses (20 weeks of treatment). The ATYR1923 doses levels to be evaluated are 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg. Approximately 36 patients will be enrolled. Starting on Day 15 patients will begin a taper (reduction) in OCS according to specific guidelines from their starting dose of 10-25 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) to a target dose of 5.0 mg/day, to be completed on or before Day 50. The OCS dose will be tapered through Week 24 and patients will be followed for the remainder of the study to determine their ability to maintain on this 5.0 mg dose. Patients who require an increase in OCS dose at any time in the study should continue to receive blinded study drug and be followed through to the end of the study.
 Cohorts 1 through 3 will be enrolled sequentially in a staggered manner. After a minimum of six patients of a given cohort have received at least three intravenous infusions of study drug (ATYR1923 or placebo), cumulative unblinded safety data will be reviewed by a data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Enrollment in the next scheduled (higher dose) cohort may commence after this review is completed, dose escalation is approved by the DSMB, and the remaining six patients have been enrolled in the current cohort. Dose escalation will continue in this manner until the highest planned dose level of ATYR1923 is reached, or the criteria for pausing enrollment have been met. 
 We are collaborating with the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research (FSR), a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure for sarcoidosis and improving care for sarcoidosis patients. Under the terms of the collaboration, FSR is assisting with clinical trial site initiation and patient enrollment for our ATYR1923 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. We anticipate that up to twelve sites in the United States will participate in the study. FSR’s Clinical Studies Network (FSR-CSN), which is led by a steering committee consisting of principal investigators from leading clinical centers, has voted to support this proof-of-concept study.

Our Discovery Engines 
 NRP-2 Receptor Biology
 We plan to leverage our discovery engine to identify NRP-2 receptor biology pathways of interest and select additional product candidates for preclinical and clinical investigation in a variety of disease settings through a combination of efforts between ourselves, collaborators and academia.
 NRP-2 is a pleiotropic cell surface receptor that was originally identified based on its role in axon guidance during neuronal development, and subsequently shown to be important in the development of the lymphatic system. NRP-2 can bind to multiple ligands and co-receptors to influence these multiple functional roles, including interaction with type 3 semaphorins and plexins to impact neural development, and also forms of vascular endothelial growth factor, especially VEGF-C which is involved in lymphogenesis.
 Recent evidence suggests that there are high levels of NRP-2 expression found on multiple immune cell types, which may play important roles in migration of immune cells, antigen presentation, phagocytosis and cell-to-cell interactions. The role of NRP-2 in the immune system has been described in several recent publications, including from the University of Technology, in Dresden, Germany (Schellenberg et al. Mol. Immunol. 90:239-244, 2017) and from UNMC (Roy et al, Front. Immunol. 8:1228, 2017). Consistent with this idea, NRP-2 is expressed in various cells of the immune system such as B cells, T-cells, NK cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, including for example, alveolar macrophages, and plays an important role in the regulation of immune cell activation and migration (see, e.g., Mendes-da-Cruz et al., PLoS ONE 9(7) e103405, 2014) including endosome maturation, the modulation of autophagy and efferocytosis, (see, e.g., Stanton et al., Cancer Res. 73:160-171, 2013; Wang et al., Cancer Lett. 418 176-184 2018). 
 These publications suggest that NRP-2 may be an important regulator of biological responses in a number of different settings with potential for therapeutic intervention. We are currently evaluating the role of the NRP-2 in the control of immune and other responses, designing optimal therapeutic approaches to modulate this newly-discovered pathway in a number of diseases with high unmet medical need and furthering our understanding of the potential therapeutic implications of this discovery and its impact on our translational science. 
 University of Nebraska Medical Center
 In January 2019, we expanded a successful pilot study and entered into a research collaboration with UNMC. The laboratory of Dr. Datta at UNMC has published extensively in the field of NRP-2 biology. 
 The collaboration will investigate:
  
• | the role of ATYR1923 on modulating the functional properties of myeloid cells, including macrophage biology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the importance of endogenous Resokine:NRP-2 interactions in other functional properties of myeloid cells;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the involvement of individual NRP-2 co-receptors/ligands on myeloid cell biology; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an assessment of the impact of different anti-NRP-2 domain-specific antibodies in immunology and cancer biology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our team is also collaborating with other established groups working on these pathways and we are excited to learn more about NRP-2 and how it may play a role in certain diseases and how it interacts with other known receptors. We will continue to research the ways in which NRP-2 utilizes common mechanisms, including VEGF-C and semaphorin 3F, to regulate diverse pathways. We believe our understanding of the functions of NRP-2 by using in vivo experiments and emerging literature in this new area of biology will allow us to select and develop additional product candidates for unmet medical diseases. 
 tRNA Synthetase Biology
 Extracellular tRNA synthetase biology represents a newly discovered set of potential physiological modulators and potential therapeutic intervention points.
 tRNA synthetases were originally thought to only play a role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAs to their respective amino acids. In 1999, our Board Member and founder, Paul Schimmel, Ph.D., and colleagues discovered that a protein derived from one of the genes for a tRNA synthetase could act as an extracellular modulator of angiogenesis. Recent research developments have further reinforced the idea that tRNA synthetases may more broadly play important roles in cellular responses beyond their well characterized role in protein synthesis. In particular, there is a growing recognition that tRNA synthetases may participate in a range of previously unrecognized roles in responding to cellular stress, and tissue homeostasis, both within the intracellular and extracellular environments.
 9

Using ATYR1923 as a model, we have developed a process with which to advance a tRNA synthetase from a concept to a product candidate. This process leverages our early discovery data as well as current scientific literature understanding of tRNA synthetase protein structure, gene splicing and tissue-specific regulation to identify potentially active protein domains. Screening approaches are employed to identify target cells and extracellular receptors for these tRNA synthetase-derived proteins. These cellular systems can then be used in mechanism-of-action studies to elucidate the role these proteins play in cellular responses and their potential therapeutic utility. We intend to expand our knowledge of tRNA synthetase biology through both industry and academic collaborations.
 CSL Behring
 In March 2019, we entered into a research collaboration and option agreement with CSL Behring for the development of product candidates derived from up to four tRNA synthetases from our preclinical pipeline. Under the terms of the collaboration, CSL Behring will fund all research and development activities related to the development of the applicable product candidates for the duration of the collaboration. CSL Behring will pay a total of up to $4.25 million per synthetase program ($17 million if all four synthetase programs advance) in option fees based on the achievement of research milestones and CSL Behring’s determination to continue development. In addition, aTyr will grant CSL Behring an option to negotiate licenses for worldwide rights to each IND candidate that emerges from this research collaboration. Specific license terms will be negotiated during an exclusivity period following the exercise of each program option.
 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 
 In October 2007, we formed our Hong Kong subsidiary, Pangu BioPharma to support our basic and translational research in tRNA synthetase biology. We hold 98% of the outstanding shares of Pangu BioPharma, and a subsidiary of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) holds the remaining outstanding shares. Pangu BioPharma collaborates with HKUST on the discovery and development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. Beginning in July 2008, Pangu BioPharma, in collaboration with HKUST, entered into a series of three research grant agreements with the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to carry out research in the discovery and development of tRNA synthetase biology. In December 2018, Pangu BioPharma renewed its annual joint research agreement with a subsidiary of HKUST, under which Pangu BioPharma agrees to fund research to be performed in 2019 with respect to development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. 
 As a result of work performed under these agreements, HKUST researchers with support from Pangu BioPharma were instrumental in discovering a splice variant of HARS that liberates the smaller, active iMod domain from the full-length tRNA synthetase and has been shown to modulate the immune system. To date, researchers at HKUST have discovered over 200 novel compositions that are covered in issued patents and have published six articles detailing their research in peer-reviewed scientific journals. 
 Pangu BioPharma is the sole beneficial owner of all resulting intellectual property rights from the research performed under these agreements, subject to the right of HKUST’s subsidiary to use certain background intellectual property of HKUST in conducting the research and, in the event Pangu BioPharma applies for individual funding of any work under the research programs, compliance with the terms and conditions of any written agreement covering ownership of such funded works. Pangu BioPharma funds the annual research on a quarterly basis. Either party may terminate the agreement during the annual period upon an uncured breach of the agreement by the other party. 
 We are also party to a license agreement with Pangu BioPharma, pursuant to which Pangu BioPharma has granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license (with a right to sublicense) in and to certain of Pangu BioPharma’s solely and jointly owned patent rights and know-how to research, develop, manufacture, use, import, export, distribute, offer for sale, sell and have sold products incorporating such patent rights and know-how for any therapeutic, prognostic or diagnostic use throughout the world.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We will face competition with respect to our product candidates and any other therapeutics we may develop or commercialize in the future, from pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. Our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and established marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop.

Although we believe we are the only company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutics based on novel functions of tRNA synthetases and NRP-2 receptor biology, we are aware of other companies that could compete with our product candidate, ATYR1923 for the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis, as indicated below.
 ATYR1923 
 For patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, the primary goal of treatment is typically to improve the patient’s quality of life, while secondarily managing the inflammation that could lead to the development of more permanent fibrosis and impairment of pulmonary function. Currently, the only FDA approved therapy for the treatment of sarcoidosis is H.P. ActharÒ Gel (a repository corticotropin injection marketed globally by Mallinckrodt plc), which was approved in 1952 and is not widely used by physicians due to toxicity and cost issues. The consensus standard of care is OCS that act mainly by suppressing inflammatory genes. OCS therapy has been shown to stabilize or improve disease symptoms, although relapse commonly occurs once OCS therapy is tapered or discontinued.  Long-term OCS use is associated with significant side effects including substantial weight gain, development of insulin resistance, osteoporosis, and risk of infection. Alternatives, such as immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents have been used as steroid-sparing agents; however, these therapies can also have significant side effects and toxicities.  Given the known toxicities of long-term OCS, immunosuppressives and cytotoxic therapeutic regimens, treatment of patients with sarcoidosis is limited to those who are symptomatic and whose disease is considered active. The presence of granulomas from sarcoidosis define the disease as active, and granulomatous inflammation is the major cause of fibrosis in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Studies to date have not clearly demonstrated that OCS or other immune-suppressive therapies prevent disease progression or formation of fibrosis. There exists a substantial need for safer and more effective therapies for sarcoidosis that could reduce or replace the requirement for long-term OCS therapy.
 If ATYR1923 is successful in the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis, we believe it may have applications in other ILD indications.  Immunosuppressive therapy has traditionally been used to treat most ILDs despite little evidence demonstrating safety or efficacy in these indications. We are aware of two FDA approved products with indications for the treatment of a specific form of ILD, namely IPF. Esbriet® (pirfenidone), marketed globally by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Shionogi Ltd. and Il Dong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Ofev® (nintedanib), a small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor marketed globally by Boehringer Ingelheim, were both approved by FDA in October 2014 to treat IPF. Esbriet® was previously approved in Japan in 2008 and in Europe in 2011. These therapies can slow lung function decline in controlled clinical studies but are associated with significant side effects, continued symptoms, and progressive disease in the majority of patients. There are a number of companies engaged in the clinical development of potential new therapeutics for various forms of ILD, including Novartis, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, FibroGen Inc., Galapagos NV, Promedior Inc., Biogen Inc., Kadmon Holdings, Inc., United Therapeutics, GlaxoSmithKline, Mallinckrodt and Hoffmann-La Roche; however, most development activity is focused on IPF, largely ignoring other major forms of ILD. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We intend, where strategically appropriate, to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States and Europe necessary to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first of such product candidates in a particular geographic market appears imminent. We may elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products in selected geographic locations or for particular indications.
 Additional capabilities important to the marketing of therapeutics include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing or testing facilities for the clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), and contract research organizations (CROs), is cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional resources early in development. Although we rely on CDMOs and CROs, we have personnel with extensive biologics development and manufacturing experience to oversee such CDMOs and CROs.
 ATYR1923 is a fusion protein that is expressed in recombinant E.coli by expression in inclusion bodies and refolding to recreate the native structure. We have worked with CDMOs in the United States on the development and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for the successful production of ATYR1923 preclinical and clinical drug substance and drug product. We contracted with CROs to conduct labeling, storage and distribution of ATYR1923 to clinical sites.
 11

To date, our CDMOs and CROs have met our manufacturing requirements for clinical development and we expect that our current CDMOs and CROs are capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our anticipated clinical development needs.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We own, or have exclusive licenses to, over 220 issued patents or allowed patent applications with predicted expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2034. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of extracellular tRNA synthetase biology.
 A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to new methods of treatment, therapeutics and additional new product forms thereof with new therapeutic or pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering our protein therapeutics, next generation product forms and the use of these compositions in a variety of therapies.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in us incurring substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
 ATYR1923
Our ATYR1923 patent portfolio is comprised of a number of patent families related to derivatives of Resokine, including the iMod domain, related splice variants, combinations with other therapeutics, and next-generation product forms with modified therapeutic activity or pharmacokinetic characteristics. As of March 2019, our ATYR1923 patent portfolio includes a patent family that is jointly owned by us and our 98% owned subsidiary, Pangu BioPharma, and includes issued patents, in the United States, Australia, China, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong, and patent applications in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Hong Kong. The U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2030 and 2031, absent any patent term extension for regulatory delays, and the ex-U.S. patents, and patents that issue from these patent applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030, absent any patent term extension. 
 The ATYR1923 patent portfolio includes another patent family jointly owned by us and Pangu BioPharma, which includes patent applications directed to related splice variants of HARS. This patent family includes issued patents in the United States, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and Hong Kong.  Patent applications are pending in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Korea. The issued patents and any patents that issue from these patent applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2031, absent any patent term extension. 
 12

Also included within the ATYR1923 patent portfolio are issued patents and pending patent applications directed to specific product forms of ATYR1923, and other HARS splice variants, including patent families directed to Fc fusion proteins, and combinations for treating lung inflammation, among other indications. One family directed to specific Fc fusion proteins includes issued patents in the United States, Europe, and Japan, and pending applications in Australia, Canada, China Europe, Hong Kong India, and Japan. In some cases, the patent applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications, and in some cases as international applications under the PCT. If issued, the patents that derive from the patent applications are predicted to expire between 2034 and 2038, absent any patent term extensions.
 Our pipeline of extracellular tRNA synthetase proteins is covered by a series of patent families, which are directed to all 20 human cytosolic tRNA synthetases. Numerous patents are issued in the United States and elsewhere, including issued U.S. patents directed to specific therapeutic protein compositions, the corresponding protein polynucleotide sequences, and certain antibody compositions to specific splice variants.  These cases are jointly owned by us and Pangu BioPharma, and include issued patents and/or pending applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China and Japan. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, would be expected to expire in 2031, absent any patent term extension. Additional patent applications have also been separately filed on GARS (Glycyl-tRNA synthetase), DARS (Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase), and other tRNA synthetases, and any patents issuing from these patent applications are expected to expire between 2026 and 2030, absent any patent term extension. We have also exclusively in-licensed from TSRI, patents and patent applications related to YARS and specific monomeric forms of tRNA synthetases.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing the non-provisional patent application from which the patent issued.
 In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the FDA, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
 Government Regulation  
 Government authorities in the United States, including federal, state, and local authorities, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of biological products, such as those we are developing. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and their implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved biologic, can be marketed in the United States. Biologics are also subject 
 13

to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations, where applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans in clinical trials. The IND submission includes the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time during clinical trials and may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit trials, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

 
new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 The clinical trial process can take up to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials.
 A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances.  Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), as amended, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug, or as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy. 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug product program fee. These fees are typically increased annually. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the BLA user fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.
 A BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 15

The FDA’s Decision on a BLA 
 The FDA evaluates a BLA to determine whether the data demonstrate that the biologic is safe, pure, and potent, or effective.  After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial. The FDA could also approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of BLAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA during development and testing, the eligibility for priority review, and rolling review, which is submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted. Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA, the FDA may grant the BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing trials or completion of ongoing trials after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims or some changes to the manufacturing process, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. 
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. 
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or 
 16

require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing, or result in the imposition of post-market studies or trials to assess new safety risks.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended (PREA) BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.  The requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except under certain circumstances.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. 
 Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Although many of the issues discussed above with 
 17

respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and in other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization application (CTA) must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The content of the BLA filed in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to countryFurther, in the United Kingdom, the planned exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty, particularly in relation to the requirements governing product licensing, pricing and reimbursement.
 Countries that are part of the European Union, as well as countries outside of the European Union, have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of biologic products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Authorization Procedures in the European Union
 Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
  
• | Centralized procedure. The European Medicine Agency (EMA) implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

In some cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric trials and their timing relative to clinical trials in adults.
 New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which a generic application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 In the European Union, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) grants orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community, or when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. Additionally, orphan medicinal product designation is only available where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
 In the European Union, orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar drug that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
 Orphan medicinal product designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval
 Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for European Union approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances may be applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization may be applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.
Accelerated Review
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether 
 19

a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third- party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.”  The BBA also extended the coverage gap discount program to include biosimilars starting in 2019.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them.  On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (CMS), have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect.  In December 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment.  In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plan, the annual fee imposed on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device exercise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to modify, repeal, or replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the ACA, any law replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal or replacement on our business remains unclear.  Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 Additionally, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a ‘‘Blueprint’’ to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow 
 20

Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (Right to Try Act) was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the provision of the ACA referred to as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug and biologics manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests of physicians and their immediate family members;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

 
• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
