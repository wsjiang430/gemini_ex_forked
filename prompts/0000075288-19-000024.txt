Item 1.    Business
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS
Overview
We are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide lifestyle brands and other owned and licensed brands as well as private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2018, 93% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and 69% of our net sales were through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2018, 96% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States consisting primarily of our Tommy Bahama product sales in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region.
Our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude.  Furthermore, we believe lifestyle brands that create an emotional connection, like Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, can command greater loyalty and higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may drive higher earnings. We believe the attraction of a lifestyle brand depends on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing products to consumers where and when they want them.  
Our ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference and presenting appealing products for consumers.  Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season. 
To further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we directly communicate with consumers through digital and print media on a regular basis.  We believe our ability to effectively communicate the images, lifestyle and products of our brands and create an emotional connection with consumers is critical to the success of our brands. Advertising for our brands often attempts to convey the lifestyle of the brand as well as a specific product. 
We distribute our owned lifestyle branded products primarily through our direct to consumer channels, consisting of our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer retail stores and our e-commerce sites for Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, and through our wholesale distribution channels. During Fiscal 2018, our retail, e-commerce and restaurant operations represented 40%, 21% and 8%, respectively, of our net sales. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them a broad assortment of our current season products and immerse them in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our 130 Tommy Bahama and 62 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. We also operate 17 Tommy Bahama restaurants, including Marlin Bars, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers. Additionally, we operate 37 Tommy Bahama outlet stores, which play an important role in overall inventory and brand management by disposing of excess inventory. 
The wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide brands generally include various specialty stores, Signature Stores for Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers. Within our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed, private label and owned brands. Lanier Apparel's customers include department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers. 
All of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S. and foreign-based apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry, and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are reputation, value, and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service.

The disposal of discontinued, end of season or excess inventory is an ongoing part of any apparel business, and our operating groups have historically utilized a variety of methods to sell such inventory, including outlet stores in Tommy Bahama, e-commerce flash sales, and off-price retailers. Our focus in disposing of the excess inventory for our lifestyle brands is to do so in a brand appropriate setting and achieve an acceptable margin. 
The apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level and focus of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as consumer preferences and regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to spend less of their discretionary spending on certain product categories, including apparel, while spending more on services and other product categories. Further, negative economic conditions often have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than on other industries.  We believe the changes in consumer preferences for discretionary spending, the current global economic conditions and economic uncertainty continue to impact the business of each of our operating groups and the apparel industry as a whole. 
We believe the retail apparel market is evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailing. The application of technology, including the internet and mobile devices, to fashion retail provides consumers increasing access to multiple, responsive distribution platforms and an unprecedented ability to communicate directly with brands and retailers. As a result, consumers have more information and greater control over information they receive as well as broader, faster and cheaper access to goods than ever before. This, along with the coming of age of the “millennial” generation, is revolutionizing the way that consumers shop for fashion and other goods, which is evidenced by weakness and store closures for certain department stores and mall-based retailers, decreased consumer retail traffic, a more promotional retail environment, expansion of off-price and discount retailers, and a shift from bricks and mortar to internet purchasing. These changes may require that brands and retailers approach their operations, including marketing and advertising, very differently than historical practices and may result in increased operating costs to generate growth or even maintain their current sales levels. 
Investments and Opportunities
While the evolution in the fashion retail industry presents significant risks, especially for traditional retailers who fail or are unable to adapt, we believe it also presents a tremendous opportunity for brands and retailers to capitalize on the changing consumer environment. We believe our brands have true competitive advantages in this new retailing paradigm, and we are leveraging technology to serve our consumers when and where they want to be served. We continue to believe that our lifestyle brands, with their strong emotional connections with consumers, are well suited to succeed and thrive in the long term while managing the various challenges facing our industry. 
Specifically, we believe our lifestyle brands have opportunities for long-term growth in our direct to consumer businesses. We anticipate increased sales in our e-commerce operations, which are expected to grow at a faster rate than bricks and mortar comparable store sales. We also believe growth can be achieved through prudent expansion of bricks and mortar full-price retail store and restaurant operations and modest comparable full-price retail store and restaurant sales increases. We expect there will continue to be desirable locations for additional retail stores, but at a more measured growth rate than prior years.
We believe our lifestyle brands have an opportunity for modest sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long term.  However, we must be diligent in our effort to avoid compromising the integrity of our brands by maintaining or growing sales with wholesale customers that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy. This is particularly important with the challenges in the department store channel, which represented approximately 12% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2018, compared to approximately 14% in Fiscal 2017.  The management of wholesale distribution for our lifestyle brands resulted in a decrease in wholesale sales in Fiscal 2018. While we anticipate modest growth in our wholesale sales in Fiscal 2019, there could be additional reductions in wholesale sales in future years, as the amount of sales to certain wholesale accounts could decrease if the number of doors that carry our product decreases, the volume sold for a particular door is reduced or the account is exited altogether. We anticipate that sales increases in our wholesale businesses in the long term will stem primarily from current customers adding within their existing door count and increasing their online business; increased sales to online retailers; and our selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally present and merchandise our products in a way that is consistent with our full-price, direct to consumer distribution strategy. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs and licenses.
We believe we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations, such as technology enhancements, e-commerce initiatives and retail store and restaurant build-out for new, relocated or remodeled 
5

locations, as well as distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate increased employment and other costs to support ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth. 
In the midst of the changes in our industry, an important initiative for us in recent years was to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focused on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses. While progress was made on these initiatives in both Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, we expect to make further progress on improving the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business in the future. 
We continue to believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe positive cash flow from operations, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, our strong cash flows from operations provide us the ability to continue to evaluate opportunities to add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio in the future if we identify appropriate targets that meet our investment criteria. While we are actively exploring acquisition opportunities, investment opportunities for the types of large brands with the attributes that we desire are not always available at an acceptable price. Therefore, our interest in acquiring smaller brands and earlier stage companies has increased in recent years, particularly in businesses where we may have the opportunity to more fully integrate the brand into our existing infrastructure and shared services functions. 
Important factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
Operating Groups
Our business is primarily operated through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide operating groups. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations, as applicable. 
Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each design, source, market and distribute apparel and related products bearing their respective trademarks and license their trademarks for other product categories, while Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's tailored clothing, sportswear and other products. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, the elimination of inter-segment sales and any other items that are not allocated to the operating groups including LIFO accounting adjustments. Because our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the operating groups. Corporate and Other also includes the operations of other businesses which are not included in our operating groups. The operations of TBBC, which we acquired in December 2017, and our Lyons, Georgia distribution center are included in Corporate and Other. 
For additional information about each of our operating groups, see Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, each included in this report. The table below presents certain financial information about each of our operating groups, as well as Corporate and Other (in thousands).

Tommy Bahama
Tommy Bahama designs, sources, markets and distributes men's and women's sportswear and related products. Tommy Bahama's typical consumer is older than 45 years old, has a household annual income in excess of $100,000, lives in or travels to warm weather and resort locations and embraces a relaxed and casual approach to daily living. Tommy Bahama products can be found in our Tommy Bahama stores and on our Tommy Bahama e-commerce website, tommybahama.com, as well as at better department stores, independent specialty stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers. We also operate Tommy Bahama restaurants and license the Tommy Bahama name for various product categories. During Fiscal 2018, 95% of Tommy Bahama's sales were to customers within the United States, with the remaining sales in Canada, Australia and Asia.
We believe that the attraction to our consumers of the Tommy Bahama brand, which was founded in 1992, is a reflection of our efforts over many years to maintain appropriate quality and design of our Tommy Bahama apparel, accessories and licensed products, limit the distribution of Tommy Bahama products to a select tier of retailers, and effectively communicate the relaxed and casual Tommy Bahama lifestyle. We expect to continue to follow this approach for the brand in the future. We believe that the retail sales value of all Tommy Bahama branded products sold during Fiscal 2018, including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers, exceeded $1.2 billion.
We believe there is ample opportunity to expand the reach of the Tommy Bahama brand, while maintaining the select distribution that Tommy Bahama has historically maintained. In order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Tommy Bahama brand. These investments include capital expenditures and ongoing expenses to enhance e-commerce and other technology capabilities; open new stores and restaurants; remodel and/or relocate existing stores and restaurants; maintain and upgrade our distribution and other facilities; and enhance our marketing efforts to communicate the lifestyle to existing and targeted new consumers.

We believe there are opportunities for continued growth in the United States primarily through direct to consumer expansion. In recent years, an important initiative for us has been to increase the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business. These initiatives generally focused on increasing gross margin and operating margin through efforts such as: product cost reductions; selective price increases; reducing inventory purchases; redefining our approach to inventory clearance; effectively managing controllable and discretionary operating expenses; taking a more conservative approach to retail store openings and lease renewals; and continuing our efforts to reduce Asia-Pacific operating losses. While progress was made on these initiatives in both Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, we expect to make further progress on improving the profitability of the Tommy Bahama business in the future. 
During Fiscal 2018, we incurred certain charges related to the restructure and downsizing of our Tommy Bahama Japan operations, including the Fiscal 2018 early lease termination and closure of the Tommy Bahama Ginza flagship retail-restaurant location, for which the lease was previously scheduled to expire in 2022. These charges included in Tommy Bahama totaled $4 million in Fiscal 2018 and are discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Following the closure of the Ginza retail store, we maintain a limited presence in Japan, which will allow us to continue to review various alternatives for the Tommy Bahama brand in Japan. We expect that operating results in our Tommy Bahama Asia-Pacific operations should be near break-even going forward after incurring losses each year since our entry into the Asia-Pacific market in 2012. 
Design, Sourcing, Marketing and Distribution
Tommy Bahama products are designed by product specific teams who focus on the target consumer. The design process includes feedback from buyers, consumers and sales agents, along with market trend research. Our Tommy Bahama apparel products generally incorporate fabrics made of cotton, silk, linen, nylon, leather, tencel and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials. 
We operate a buying office located in Hong Kong to manage the production and sourcing of the substantial majority of our Tommy Bahama products. During Fiscal 2018, we utilized approximately 185 suppliers to manufacture our Tommy Bahama products and 70% of Tommy Bahama's product purchases were from manufacturers in China. The largest 10 suppliers of Tommy Bahama products provided 50% of the products acquired during Fiscal 2018, with no individual supplier providing more than 10%.
Advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy for the Tommy Bahama brand, and we therefore devote significant resources to these efforts. While advertising for Tommy Bahama promotes our products, the primary emphasis is on brand image and brand lifestyle. Tommy Bahama's advertising attempts to engage individuals within the brand's consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our retail stores, e-commerce websites or wholesale customers' stores and websites in search of our products. The marketing of the Tommy Bahama brand includes email, internet and social media advertising and traditional media such as catalogs, print and other communications, as well as moving media and trade show initiatives. As a lifestyle brand, we believe that it is very important that Tommy Bahama communicate regularly with consumers about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen Tommy Bahama's guest connections. 
We also believe that highly visible full-price retail store locations with creative design, broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers. We intend for our full-price retail stores to enhance our guests' shopping experience, which we believe will increase brand loyalty. Marketing initiatives at our full-price retail stores may include special event promotions and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our products, including those that support worthwhile causes in local communities. 
In addition, we utilize loyalty award cards, Flip Side events and Friends & Family events to drive traffic to our stores and websites. These initiatives are effective in increasing traffic as the proportion of our sales that occur during our marketing initiatives have increased in recent years, which puts some downward pressure on our direct to consumer gross margins. We believe our traditional and digital media communications increase the sales of our own full-price retail stores and e-commerce operations, as well as the sales of our products for our wholesale customers.
For certain wholesale customers, we also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our products and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs.
We operate a Tommy Bahama distribution center in Auburn, Washington, which serves our North America direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Activities at the distribution center include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to our Tommy Bahama stores, our wholesale customers and our e-commerce customers. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of Tommy Bahama inventory at the distribution center to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked orders and some limited replenishment ordering for our wholesale customers. We use local third party distribution centers for our Asia-Pacific operations.

Direct to Consumer Operations
A key component of our Tommy Bahama growth strategy is to operate our own stores and e-commerce websites, which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which the products are based. Our Tommy Bahama direct to consumer channels, which consist of retail store, e-commerce and restaurant operations, in the aggregate, represented 79% of Tommy Bahama's net sales in Fiscal 2018. We expect the percentage of our Tommy Bahama sales which are direct to consumer sales will continue to increase in future years. Retail store, e-commerce and restaurant net sales accounted for 48%, 18% and 13%, respectively, of Tommy Bahama's net sales in Fiscal 2018. 
Our direct to consumer strategy for the Tommy Bahama brand includes locating and operating full-price retail stores in upscale malls, lifestyle shopping centers, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. Generally, we seek to locate our full-price retail stores in shopping areas and malls that have high-profile or upscale consumer brand adjacencies. As of February 2, 2019, the majority of our Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores were in street-front locations or lifestyle centers with the remainder primarily in regional indoor malls. Our full-price retail stores allow us the opportunity to carry a full line of current season merchandise, including apparel, home products and accessories, all presented in an aspirational, island-inspired atmosphere designed to be relaxed, comfortable and unique. We believe that the Tommy Bahama full-price retail stores provide high visibility for the brand and products and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers. Further, we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the full-price retail stores with limited in-store promotional activities are good for the Tommy Bahama brand and, in turn, enhance business with our wholesale customers. Generally, we believe there are opportunities for additional full-price retail stores in both warmer and colder climates, as we believe the more important consideration is whether the location attracts the affluent consumer that we are targeting. We believe that we have opportunities for continued direct to consumer sales growth for our Tommy Bahama women's business, which represented 30% of sales in our full-price direct to consumer operations in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 compared to 28% in Fiscal 2016. In Fiscal 2018, approximately one-fourth of the sales of women's product in our full-price direct to consumer operations were swimwear, cover-ups and swim-related products. 
Disposal of discontinued or end of season inventory is an ongoing part of any apparel business and, historically, Tommy Bahama has utilized its outlet stores and sales to off-price retailers to sell its excess inventory. Our Tommy Bahama outlet stores, which generated 9% of our total Tommy Bahama net sales in Fiscal 2018, are generally located in outlet shopping centers that include upscale retailers and serve an important role in overall inventory management by often allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties. We believe that this approach has helped us protect the integrity of the Tommy Bahama brand by allowing our full-price retail stores to limit promotional activity while controlling the distribution of discontinued and out-of-season product. To supplement the clearance items sold in Tommy Bahama outlets, approximately 20% of the product sold in our Tommy Bahama outlets was made specifically for our outlets. We anticipate that we would generally operate one outlet for approximately every three full-price retail stores. In Fiscal 2018, we closed two outlets and opened one outlet. 
In an effort to improve the profitability of our end of season clearance strategy for our products, commencing in 2017, we initiated selected initial markdowns in our full-price retail stores and on our e-commerce website for end of season product and disposed of more end of season inventory for women's, home and other product categories through off-price retailers than we have historically. We expect to continue this clearance model, which has reduced the quantity of end of season product that is transferred to our outlets. We believe that this model has improved the product offering and presentation in our outlet stores and has improved the profitability of our end of season clearance sales. 
For Tommy Bahama's domestic full-price retail stores and retail-restaurant locations operating for the full Fiscal 2018 year, sales per gross square foot, excluding restaurant sales and restaurant space, were approximately $610 during Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2018, our domestic outlet stores generated approximately $340 of sales per square foot for outlets open for the entire 2018 fiscal year. 
As of February 2, 2019, we operated 17 Tommy Bahama restaurants including Marlin Bar locations, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location. These retail-restaurant locations, which generate approximately 25% of Tommy Bahama's net sales, provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate Tommy Bahama experience. We do not anticipate that the majority of our retail locations will have an adjacent restaurant; however, in select high-profile, brand appropriate locations, such as Naples, Florida, Waikiki, Hawaii, and New York City, we have determined that an adjacent restaurant can further enhance the image or exposure of the brand. The net sales per square foot in our domestic full-price retail stores which are adjacent to a restaurant are on average twice the sales per square foot of our other domestic full-price retail stores. We believe that the customer immersing themselves into the Tommy Bahama lifestyle by having a meal or a drink at the Tommy Bahama restaurant and visiting the adjacent retail store may entice the customer to purchase additional Tommy Bahama merchandise and potentially provide a memorable consumer experience that further enhances the relationship between Tommy Bahama and the consumer. During Fiscal 2016, we opened our first Marlin Bar 
9

concept location in Estero, Florida. In Fiscal 2018, we opened our second Marlin Bar concept location in Palm Springs, California. The Marlin Bar concept, like our traditional restaurant locations, is adjacent to one of our retail locations and serves food and beverages, but in a smaller space and with food options more focused on small plate offerings rather than entrees. The first two Marlin Bar locations, in both the restaurant and full-price retail store sales of the location, have provided nice financial results to date. We believe that with the smaller footprint, reduced labor requirements and lower required capital expenditure for build-out, the Marlin Bar concept provides us with the long-term potential for opening retail-restaurant locations in sites that otherwise may not have been suitable or brand appropriate for one of our traditional retail-restaurant locations. 
As of February 2, 2019, the total square feet of space utilized for our Tommy Bahama full-price retail store and outlet store operations was 0.6 million with another 0.1 million of total square feet utilized in our Tommy Bahama restaurant operations. The table below provides certain information regarding Tommy Bahama retail stores and restaurants operated by us as of February 2, 2019. 
 | Full-Price Retail Stores | Outlet Stores | Retail-RestaurantLocations (1) | Total

(1) Consists of 15 retail-restaurant locations of our traditional island format and two Marlin Bar retail-restaurant locations. 
(2) Square feet for retail-restaurant locations consists of retail space square feet and excludes square feet used in the associated restaurant operations.

The table below reflects the changes in store count for Tommy Bahama stores during Fiscal 2018.
 | Full-Price Retail Stores | Outlet Stores | Retail-RestaurantLocations | Total
Open as of beginning of fiscal year | 110 | | 38 | | 18 | | 166 | 
Opened | 3 | | 1 | | 1 | | 5 | 
Closed | — | | (2 | ) | (2 | ) | (4 | )
Open as of end of fiscal year | 113 | | 37 | | 17 | | 167 | 

We anticipate that our store count at the end of Fiscal 2019 will be comparable to our store count at the end of Fiscal 2018. We expect that much of our store opening activity in Fiscal 2019 will be in the second half of the year and focused on additional Marlin Bar locations. In Fiscal 2019 we expect to open three Marlin Bars consisting of two Marlin Bars which are a relocation and expansion of an existing retail store location and one of which is a new location. In Fiscal 2019 as well as in future years, we expect to opportunistically close certain marginal full-price retail and outlet locations at lease expiration unless the landlord provides a compelling offer for us to continue in the location. We believe there continue to be opportunities for Tommy Bahama to open additional full-price retail and retail-restaurant locations in the future, but we do not expect the number of locations to increase at the same pace as prior years and some of the growth may be conversions of full-price retail stores to retail-restaurant locations.

The operation of full-price retail stores, outlet stores and retail-restaurant locations requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We estimate that we will spend approximately $1 million on average in connection with the build-out of a domestic full-price retail store. However, individual locations, particularly those in urban locations, may require investments greater than these amounts depending on a variety of factors, including the location and size of the full-price retail store. The cost of a traditional Tommy Bahama retail-restaurant location and a Marlin Bar is significantly more than the cost of a full-price retail store and can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors. Historically, the cost of our retail-restaurant locations has been approximately $5 million; however, we have spent significantly more than that amount for certain locations and significantly less than this amount for our two Marlin Bar locations. For most of our retail stores and restaurants, the landlord provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures.
Additionally, we incur capital expenditure costs related to periodic remodels of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. We also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires, and we determine it is appropriate to relocate to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store. The cost of store relocations is generally comparable to the costs of opening a new full-price retail store or outlet store. We anticipate that the capital expenditures for relocations and remodels, in the aggregate, may continue to increase in future periods. 
In addition to our full-price retail stores and outlet stores, our direct to consumer approach includes various e-commerce websites, including the tommybahama.com website. During Fiscal 2018, e-commerce sales represented 18% of Tommy Bahama's net sales. Our Tommy Bahama websites allow consumers to buy Tommy Bahama products directly from us via the internet. These websites also enable us to increase our database of consumer contacts, which allows us to communicate directly and frequently with consenting consumers. As we reach more customers in the future, we anticipate that our e-commerce distribution channel for Tommy Bahama will continue to grow at a faster pace than our domestic full-price retail store operations or wholesale operations. 
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we continue to maintain our profitable wholesale operations for Tommy Bahama. Tommy Bahama's wholesale customers include better department stores, specialty stores and multi-brand e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. We value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Tommy Bahama brand within their stores. 
Wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama accounted for 21% of Tommy Bahama's net sales in Fiscal 2018. Approximately 60% of Tommy Bahama's wholesale business reflects sales to major department stores with the remaining wholesale sales primarily sales to specialty stores. Tommy Bahama men's products are available in more than 1,800 retail locations in North America, while Tommy Bahama women's products are available in more than 1,100 retail locations in North America. During Fiscal 2018, 16% of Tommy Bahama's net sales were to Tommy Bahama's ten largest wholesale customers, with its largest customer representing 5% of Tommy Bahama's net sales. 
We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Tommy Bahama brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution, with careful selection of the retailers through which Tommy Bahama products are sold. As a result of our approach to limiting our wholesale distribution, we believe that sales growth in our men's apparel wholesale business, which represented approximately 86% of Tommy Bahama's domestic wholesale sales in Fiscal 2018, may be somewhat limited. However, we believe that we may have opportunities for wholesale sales increases for our Tommy Bahama women's business in the future, with its appeal evidenced by women's product representing 30% of sales in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites in Fiscal 2018. 
We maintain Tommy Bahama apparel sales offices and showrooms in New York and Seattle, as well as other locations, to facilitate sales to our wholesale customers. Our Tommy Bahama wholesale operations utilize a sales force consisting of a combination of Tommy Bahama employees and independent commissioned sales representatives.
Licensing Operations
We believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for the Tommy Bahama brand. For an established lifestyle brand, licensing typically requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. In evaluating a licensee for Tommy Bahama, we typically consider the candidate's experience, financial stability, sourcing expertise and marketing ability. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed licensed products with other Tommy Bahama products.
11

Our agreements with Tommy Bahama licensees are for specific geographic areas and expire at various dates in the future, and in limited cases include contingent renewal options. Generally, the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty payments based on specified percentages of the licensee's net sales of the licensed products as well as obligations to expend certain funds towards marketing the brand on an approved basis. Our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution. Third party license arrangements for our Tommy Bahama products include the following product categories:
Men's and women's headwear | Watches | Outdoor furniture and related products
Footwear | Belts, leather goods and gifts | Indoor furniture 
Men's hosiery | Handbags | Mattresses and box springs 
Sleepwear | Luggage | Bedding and bath linens 
Shampoo, soap and bath amenities | Rugs | Table top accessories 
Cigar accessories | Fragrances | Fabrics 

In addition to our license arrangements for the specific product categories listed above, we may enter into certain international distributor agreements which allow those parties to distribute Tommy Bahama apparel and other products on a wholesale and/or retail basis within certain countries or regions. As of February 2, 2019, we have agreements for distribution of Tommy Bahama products in the Middle East, Greater China and parts of Latin America. Substantially all of the products sold by the distributors are identical to the products sold in our own Tommy Bahama stores. In addition to selling Tommy Bahama goods to wholesale accounts, the distributors may, in some cases, operate their own retail stores. As of February 2, 2019, we have licensed Tommy Bahama stores located in the Middle East, Greater China and Central America. None of these agreements are expected to generate growth that would materially impact the operating results of Tommy Bahama in the near term. 
Seasonal Aspects of Business
Tommy Bahama's operating results are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. Typically, the demand in the direct to consumer operations, including sales at our own stores and e-commerce sites, for Tommy Bahama products in our principal markets is generally higher in the spring, summer and holiday seasons and lower in the fall season. However, wholesale product shipments are generally shipped prior to each of the retail selling seasons. As the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments or other factors affecting the business may vary from one year to the next, we do not believe that net sales or operating income (loss) for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income (loss) for Fiscal 2018 are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. The following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income (loss) for Tommy Bahama by quarter for Fiscal 2018:

 | First Quarter | Second Quarter | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Net sales | 25 | % | 29 | % | 18 | % | 28 | %
Operating income (loss) | 27 | % | 39 | % | (10 | )% | 44 | %

Lilly Pulitzer
Lilly Pulitzer designs, sources, markets and distributes upscale collections of women's and girl's dresses, sportswear and related products. The Lilly Pulitzer brand was originally created in the late 1950s by Lilly Pulitzer and is an affluent brand with a heritage and aesthetic based on the Palm Beach resort lifestyle. The brand is somewhat unique among women's brands in that it has demonstrated multi-generational appeal, including among young women in college or recently graduated from college; young mothers with their daughters; and women who are not tied to the academic calendar. Lilly Pulitzer products can be found in our owned Lilly Pulitzer stores, in Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores, which are described below, and on our Lilly Pulitzer website, lillypulitzer.com, as well as in better department and independent specialty stores. During Fiscal 2018, 50% and 35% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales were for women's sportswear and dresses, respectively, with the remaining sales consisting of Lilly Pulitzer accessories, including scarves, bags, jewelry and belts; children's apparel; footwear; and licensed products. 
We believe that there is significant opportunity to expand the reach of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, while at the same time maintaining the exclusive distribution that Lilly Pulitzer has historically maintained. We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Lilly Pulitzer brand. These investments include enhancing e-commerce and other technology capabilities; opening and operating full-price retail stores; remodeling and/or relocating existing stores; and increasing employment, advertising and other functions to support a growing business. While we believe that these investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments may have a short-term negative impact on 
12

Lilly Pulitzer's operating margin, particularly if there is insufficient sales growth to absorb the incremental costs in a particular year.
We believe the attraction of the Lilly Pulitzer brand to our consumers is a reflection of years of maintaining appropriate quality and design of the Lilly Pulitzer apparel, accessories and licensed products, restricting the distribution of the Lilly Pulitzer products to a select tier of retailers and effectively communicating the message of Lilly Pulitzer's optimistic Palm Beach resort chic lifestyle. We believe this approach to quality, design, distribution and communication has been critical in allowing us to achieve the current retail price points for Lilly Pulitzer products. We believe that the retail sales value of all Lilly Pulitzer branded products sold during Fiscal 2018, including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers, exceeded $325 million.
Design, Sourcing, Marketing and Distribution
Lilly Pulitzer's products are developed by our dedicated design teams located at the Lilly Pulitzer headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania as well as in Palm Beach, Florida. Our Lilly Pulitzer design teams focus on the target consumer, and the design process combines feedback from buyers, consumers and our sales force, along with market trend research. Lilly Pulitzer apparel products are designed to incorporate various fiber types, including cotton, silk, linen and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials.
Lilly Pulitzer uses a combination of in-house employees in our King of Prussia and Hong Kong offices and third party buying agents primarily based in Asia to manage the production and sourcing of its apparel products. Through its buying agents and direct sourcing, Lilly Pulitzer used approximately 50 vendors, with no individual supplier providing more than 10% and the largest 10 suppliers providing 55%, of the products acquired during Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2018, 50% of Lilly Pulitzer's product purchases were from manufacturers located in China. 
Advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, and we therefore devote significant resources to advertising and marketing. Lilly Pulitzer's advertising attempts to engage individuals within the brand's consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our full-price retail stores, e-commerce websites and wholesale customers' stores and websites in search of our products. The marketing of the Lilly Pulitzer brand includes email, internet and social media advertising as well as traditional media such as catalogs, print and other communications and moving media and trade show initiatives. We believe that it is very important that a lifestyle brand effectively communicate with consumers on a regular basis about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen the brand's connections with guests. 
In addition to our ongoing Lilly Pulitzer marketing initiatives, on occasion we also enter into collaborations with third parties to increase brand awareness or create additional brand excitement like we did with S'well water bottles and Pottery Barn in recent years. Often these collaborations do not generate material direct revenue for Lilly Pulitzer, but instead provide significant press or social media exposure and excitement for the brand that complement our ongoing advertising and marketing initiatives. We believe in today's environment it is important to continue to find new, creative ways to advertise in order to differentiate the brand.
We believe that highly visible full-price retail store locations with creative design, broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit our full-price retail stores and buy merchandise. We believe that full-price retail stores enhance the shopping experience of our customers, which will increase consumer brand loyalty. Marketing initiatives at certain of our full-price retail stores may include special event promotions and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our stores and products and in some cases including "shop and share" events benefiting local charities. At certain times during the year, an integral part of the marketing plan for Lilly Pulitzer includes certain gift with purchase programs where the consumer earns the right to a Lilly Pulitzer gift product if certain spending thresholds are achieved. We believe that our full-price retail store operations, as well as our traditional and digital media communications and periodic collaborations with others, enhance brand awareness and increase the sales of Lilly Pulitzer products in all channels of distribution. 
For certain of our wholesale customers, we also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our branded products at their retail locations and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs.
Lilly Pulitzer operates a distribution center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Activities at the distribution center include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to wholesale customers, Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores and our e-commerce customers. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory at the distribution center to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked orders and some limited replenishment ordering for our wholesale customers.
Direct to Consumer Operations
13

A key component of our Lilly Pulitzer growth strategy is to operate our own stores and e-commerce website, which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which they are based. Lilly Pulitzer's direct to consumer distribution channel, which consists of full-price retail store and e-commerce operations, represented 78% and 72% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. We expect the percentage of our Lilly Pulitzer sales which are direct to consumer sales will continue to increase in future years, but at a much more modest pace than the Fiscal 2018 increase.
Our direct to consumer strategy for the Lilly Pulitzer brand includes operating full-price retail stores in higher-end malls, lifestyle shopping centers, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. Sales at our full-price retail stores represented 42% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales during Fiscal 2018. As of February 2, 2019, about one-third of our Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in outdoor regional lifestyle centers and another one-third of our Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in indoor regional malls, with the remaining locations in resort or street locations. In certain resort locations such as Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Watch Hill, our stores are only open during the resort season. Additionally, we may open temporary pop-up stores in certain locations. 
Each full-price retail store carries a wide range of merchandise, including apparel, footwear and accessories, all presented in a manner intended to enhance the Lilly Pulitzer image, brand awareness and acceptance. Our Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores allow us to present Lilly Pulitzer's full line of current season products. We believe our Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for the brand and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers. We also believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the full-price retail stores with limited promotional activities complement our business with our wholesale customers. Generally, we believe there are opportunities for full-price retail stores in both warmer and cooler climates, as we believe the more important consideration is whether the location attracts the affluent consumer that we are targeting. 
Lilly Pulitzer's full-price retail store sales per gross square foot for Fiscal 2018 were approximately $725 for the full-price retail stores which were open the full Fiscal 2018 year compared to approximately $800 for the Lilly Pulitzer stores open for the full Fiscal 2017. The decrease in sales per gross square foot was primarily due to the impact of smaller market seasonal and resort location stores opened, including acquired Signature Stores, during Fiscal 2017, partially offset by positive comparable store sales. The table below provides certain information regarding Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores as of February 2, 2019. 
 | Number ofFull-Price Retail Stores
Florida | 18 
Massachusetts | 7 
Virginia | 6 
Maryland | 3 
New York | 3 
North Carolina | 3 
Ohio | 3 
Texas | 3 
Other | 16 
Total | 62 
Average square feet per store | 2,600 
Total square feet at year-end | 160,000 

The table below reflects the changes in store count for Lilly Pulitzer stores during Fiscal 2018.
 | Full-Price Retail Stores
Open as of beginning of fiscal year | 57 
Opened | 5 
Open as of end of fiscal year | 62 

After increasing our store count by five stores in Fiscal 2018, including opening stores on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Florida and at Whalers Village in Maui, Hawaii, we expect to open stores at a more modest pace in Fiscal 2019. In the First Quarter of Fiscal 2019, we opened a Lilly Pulitzer store in Newport Beach, California. The operation of full-price retail 
14

stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We anticipate that most future full-price retail store openings will generally be 2,500 square feet on average; however, the determination of actual size of the store will depend on a variety of criteria. To open a 2,500 square foot Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail store, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1 million on average. For most of our full-price retail stores, the landlord provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures.
In addition to new store openings, we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels, expansions or downsizing of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. We may also incur capital expenditures if we determine it is appropriate to relocate a store to a new location. The cost of store relocations, if any, will generally be comparable to the cost of opening a new store. Alternatively, when a lease expires we may decide to close the store rather than relocating the store to another location or renewing the lease.
In addition to operating Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, another key element of our direct to consumer strategy is the lillypulitzer.com website, which represented 36% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales in Fiscal 2018 compared to 34% in Fiscal 2017. The Lilly Pulitzer e-commerce business has experienced significant growth in recent years, and we anticipate that the rate of growth of the e-commerce business will remain strong in the future. We also utilize the Lilly Pulitzer website as an effective means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory in a brand appropriate manner and at gross margins in excess of 40% via e-commerce flash clearance sales. These sales are brand appropriate events that create a significant amount of excitement with loyal Lilly Pulitzer consumers, who are looking for an opportunity to purchase Lilly Pulitzer products at a discounted price. These e-commerce flash clearance sales typically run for three days during the summer clearance period in August or September and for two days during the post-holiday clearance period in January, allowing the Lilly Pulitzer website to remain full-price for the remaining 360 days of the year. During Fiscal 2018, approximately 46% of Lilly Pulitzer's e-commerce sales were e-commerce flash clearance sales. 
Wholesale Operations
To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, we continue to maintain our profitable wholesale operations for Lilly Pulitzer. These wholesale operations are primarily with independent specialty stores, Signature Stores, better department stores and multi-branded e-commerce retailers that generally follow a retail model approach with limited discounting. During Fiscal 2018, approximately 22% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales were sales to wholesale customers compared to 28% in Fiscal 2017 with the decrease primarily due to Lilly Pulitzer's acquisition of 12 Signature Stores in Fiscal 2017 and reduced sales to department stores as Lilly Pulitzer continues to manage its distribution in wholesale accounts. During Fiscal 2018, about one-third of Lilly Pulitzer's wholesale sales were to Lilly Pulitzer's Signature Stores, one-fourth of Lilly Pulitzer's wholesale sales were to specialty stores and one-fifth of Lilly Pulitzer's wholesale sales were to department stores. The remaining wholesale sales were primarily to national accounts, including on-line retailers, and off-price retailers. Lilly Pulitzer's net sales to its ten largest wholesale customers represented 11% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales in Fiscal 2018 with its largest customer representing less than 5% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales. 
An important part of Lilly Pulitzer's wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For these stores, we enter into agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all the store specifically for Lilly Pulitzer products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. These agreements are generally for a two-year period. We sell products to these Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of February 2, 2019, there were 48 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores. 
We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Lilly Pulitzer products are sold. We continue to value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand within their stores. Lilly Pulitzer apparel products are available in approximately 250 wholesale doors. 
We maintain Lilly Pulitzer apparel sales offices and showrooms in Palm Beach, Florida, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and New York City. Our wholesale operations for Lilly Pulitzer utilize a sales force consisting of salaried sales employees.
Licensing Operations
We license the Lilly Pulitzer trademark to licensees in categories beyond Lilly Pulitzer's core product categories. In the long term, we believe licensing may be an attractive business opportunity for the Lilly Pulitzer brand, particularly once our direct to consumer presence has expanded. Once a brand is established, licensing requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. In evaluating a potential Lilly Pulitzer licensee, we consider the candidate's experience, financial stability, manufacturing performance and 
15

marketing ability. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed products with other Lilly Pulitzer branded products.
Our agreements with Lilly Pulitzer licensees are for specific geographic areas and expire at various dates in the future. Generally, the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty and advertising payments based on specified percentages of the licensee's net sales of the licensed products. Our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution.
Third party license arrangements for Lilly Pulitzer products include the following product categories: stationery and gift products; home furnishing fabrics; and eyewear.
Seasonal Aspects of Business
Lilly Pulitzer's operating results are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style as well as demand by distribution channel may vary significantly depending on the time of year. Typically, the demand in the direct to consumer operations for Lilly Pulitzer products is generally higher in the spring, summer and resort seasons and lower in the fall season. However, wholesale product shipments are generally shipped prior to each of the retail selling seasons. Further, in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which have not historically been strong direct to consumer or wholesale quarters for Lilly Pulitzer, Lilly Pulitzer has held significant e-commerce flash clearance sales which partially offsets the impact of seasonality on Lilly Pulitzer's sales, but to a lesser degree on operating income. As the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments, the magnitude of e-commerce flash clearance sales or other factors affecting the business may vary from one year to the next, we do not believe that net sales or operating income for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales for Fiscal 2018 are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. The following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income for Lilly Pulitzer by quarter for Fiscal 2018:

 | First Quarter | Second Quarter | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Net sales | 25 | % | 26 | % | 25 | % | 24 | %
Operating income | 34 | % | 39 | % | 20 | % | 7 | %

Lanier Apparel
Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's apparel, including tailored clothing, casual pants and sportswear, across a wide range of price points, but primarily at moderate price points. The majority of our Lanier Apparel products are sold under certain trademarks licensed to us by third parties. Lanier Apparel's licensed brands for certain product categories include Kenneth Cole®, Dockers®, Nick Graham® and Cole Haan®, which is a new license for Lanier Apparel with initial product sales in Fiscal 2018. Additionally, we design and market products for our owned Billy London®, Oxford® (formerly Oxford Golf®), Duck Head® and Strong Suit® brands. Both Duck Head and Strong Suit were acquired during Fiscal 2016. Sales of branded products licensed to us or owned by us represented 60% and 20%, respectively, of Lanier Apparel's net sales during Fiscal 2018.
In addition to these branded businesses, Lanier Apparel designs and sources private label apparel products for certain customers, including tailored clothing and pants programs for large department stores, warehouse clubs, and other retailers. Sales of private label products represented 20% of Lanier Apparel's net sales in Fiscal 2018. For our large retail customers, the private label programs offer the customer product exclusivity, generally at higher gross margins than they would achieve on branded products, while allowing us the opportunity to leverage our design, sourcing, production, logistics and distribution infrastructure. For other customers, we may perform any combination of design, sourcing, production, logistics or distribution services for a brand owner. In these cases, the brand owner may have determined it is more efficient to outsource certain functions, may be a smaller company that lacks such functional expertise or may want to focus their energies on the other aspects of their brand. Lanier Apparel is an efficient operator that excels in sourcing, production, logistics, distribution and design and can leverage its infrastructure by providing services and resources to these smaller brand owners. 
Our Lanier Apparel products are primarily sold through large retailers including department stores, discount and off-price retailers, warehouse clubs, national chains, specialty retailers, multi-branded e-commerce retailers and others. Lanier Apparel's products are sold in more than 5,000 retail locations. In Lanier Apparel, we have long-standing relationships with some of the United States' largest retailers, including department stores which represented 30% of Lanier Apparel's sales in Fiscal 2018. During Fiscal 2018, Lanier Apparel's three largest customers represented 23%, 20%, and 17%, respectively, of Lanier Apparel's net sales. Sales to Lanier Apparel's 10 largest customers represented more than 80% of Lanier Apparel's net sales during Fiscal 2018. The amount and percentage of net sales attributable to an individual customer in future years may be different than Fiscal 2018 as sales to wholesale customers are not tied to long-term contracts. 
16

As certain of Lanier Apparel's private label and branded sales are program based, where Lanier Apparel must bid for a program on a case-by-case and season-by-season basis, an individual customer could increase, decrease or discontinue its purchases from us at any time. Thus, significant fluctuations in Lanier Apparel's operating results from one year to the next may result, particularly if a program is not renewed, the customer decides to use another vendor, we determine that the return on the program is not acceptable to us, a new program is initiated, there is a significant increase in the volume of the program or otherwise.
The moderate price point tailored clothing and sportswear markets are extremely competitive sectors, with significant retail competition as well as gross margin pressures due to retail sales price pressures and production cost increases. We believe that our Lanier Apparel business has historically excelled at bringing quality products to our customers at competitive prices and managing inventory risk appropriately while requiring minimal capital expenditure investments.
Design, Manufacturing, Sourcing, Marketing and Distribution
We believe that superior customer service and supply chain management, as well as the design of quality products, are all integral components of our strategy in the branded and private label tailored clothing and sportswear markets in which Lanier Apparel operates. Our Lanier Apparel design teams, which are primarily located in New York City and Atlanta, focus on the target consumer for each brand and product. The design process combines feedback from buyers and sales agents along with market trend research and input from manufacturers. Our various Lanier Apparel products are manufactured from a variety of fibers, including wool, silk, linen, cotton and other natural fibers, as well as synthetics and blends of these materials. 
Lanier Apparel manages production in Asia and Latin America through the efforts of our Lanier Apparel offices in Atlanta and Hong Kong as well as third party buying agents. Lanier Apparel's sourcing operations are also supplemented, as appropriate, by third party contractors who may provide certain sourcing functions or in-country quality assurance to further enhance Lanier Apparel's global sourcing operations. During Fiscal 2018, almost two-thirds of Lanier Apparel's product purchases were from manufacturers located in Vietnam. Lanier Apparel purchased goods from approximately 135 suppliers in Fiscal 2018. The 10 largest suppliers of Lanier Apparel provided 90% of the finished goods and raw materials Lanier Apparel acquired from third parties during Fiscal 2018, with 30% of our product purchases acquired from Lanier Apparel's largest third party supplier. In addition to purchasing products from third parties, Lanier Apparel operates a manufacturing facility, located in Merida, Mexico, which produced 10% of our Lanier Apparel products during Fiscal 2018.
The advertising efforts of Lanier Apparel are much more product specific than the advertising for our owned lifestyle brands. For Lanier Apparel's licensed branded products, advertising primarily consists of cooperative advertising with our larger customers, contributions to the licensor based on a specified percentage of our net sales to fund the licensor's general brand advertising initiatives and attending brand appropriate trade shows. As a provider of private label apparel, we are generally not responsible for advertising for private label brands. For its owned brands, Lanier Apparel engages in marketing activities to increase the recognition and appeal of the brands. 
For Lanier Apparel, we utilize a distribution center located in Toccoa, Georgia, a distribution center in Lyons, Georgia and certain third party distribution centers for our product shipments, where we receive goods from our suppliers, inspect those products and ship the goods to our customers. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to support programs for pre-booked orders and to meet customer demand for at-once ordering. For certain standard product styles, which represents about one-half of Lanier Apparel's net sales, we maintain in-stock replenishment programs, providing shipment to customers and consumers within just a few days of receiving the order. These types of programs generally require higher inventory levels. Lanier Apparel utilizes various off-price retailers to sell excess prior-season inventory. 
We maintain apparel sales offices and showrooms for our Lanier Apparel products in several locations, including New York City and Atlanta and employ a sales force consisting primarily of salaried employees. Lanier Apparel operates websites for certain of its businesses and also ships orders directly to consumers who purchase products from the websites of certain of its wholesale customers. Sales to our customers where the consumer orders from the website of Lanier Apparel's wholesale customers, e-commerce retailers and catalog retailers as well as sales on Lanier Apparel's own websites represented more than 10% of Lanier Apparel's sales in Fiscal 2018. 
Seasonal Aspects of Business
Lanier Apparel's operating results are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style may vary significantly depending on the time of year. As a wholesale apparel business, in which product shipments generally occur prior to the retail selling seasons, the seasonality of Lanier Apparel often reflects stronger spring and fall wholesale deliveries which typically occur in our first and third quarters; however, in some fiscal years this will not be the case due to certain of Lanier Apparel's operations resulting from program-driven businesses. The timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments, the introduction of new programs, the loss of programs or customers or other factors affecting the business may vary significantly from one year to the next. Therefore, we do not believe that net sales or operating 
17

income of Lanier Apparel for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for Fiscal 2018 are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. The following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income for Lanier Apparel by quarter for Fiscal 2018:

 | First Quarter | Second Quarter | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Net sales | 20 | % | 24 | % | 29 | % | 27 | %
Operating income | 7 | % | 16 | % | 45 | % | 32 | %

Southern Tide
We acquired the Southern Tide lifestyle apparel brand in Fiscal 2016. Southern Tide designs, sources, markets and distributes high-quality apparel bearing the distinctive Skipjack logo. Southern Tide offers an extensive selection of men’s shirts, pants, shorts, outerwear, ties, swimwear, footwear and accessories, as well as women's and youth collections. Launched in 2006, Southern Tide combines the modern design elements of today's youthful trends with love for the Southern culture and lifestyle. The brand has an appeal to all ages who have an appreciation for classic design, vibrant colors, a great fit and an affection for the coast. Southern Tide products can be found in independent specialty retailers, better department stores, Southern Tide Signature Stores as described below, and on our Southern Tide website, southerntide.com. During Fiscal 2018, 82% of Southern Tide's sales were wholesale sales and 18% of Southern Tide's sales were e-commerce sales. 
We believe that there is significant opportunity to expand the reach of the Southern Tide brand by increasing the specialty store, department store and Signature Store presence of the brand, as well as increasing e-commerce sales. However, this growth and expansion will be at a prudent pace as we believe that the integrity and success of the Southern Tide brand is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Southern Tide products are sold. 
We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Southern Tide brand. In the near term, these investments will primarily consist of an increase in employment, advertising and other costs to support a growing wholesale business with specialty and department stores, increasing the number of Southern Tide Signature Stores and costs to enhance e-commerce and other technology capabilities. While we believe that these investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments may have a short-term negative impact on Southern Tide's operating margin given the current size of the Southern Tide business. We believe that the retail sales value of all Southern Tide branded products sold during Fiscal 2018, including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers, exceeded $75 million.
Design, Sourcing, Marketing and Distribution
Southern Tide's products are developed by our dedicated design teams located at the Southern Tide headquarters in Greenville, South Carolina. Our Southern Tide design teams focus on the target consumer, and the design process combines feedback from buyers, consumers and our sales force, along with market trend research. Southern Tide apparel products are designed to incorporate various fiber types, including cotton and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials.
During Fiscal 2018, Southern Tide utilized our Hong Kong-based sourcing office to manage the production and sourcing of a majority of its apparel product purchases with the remaining product purchases via third party buying agents. Southern Tide used approximately 70 suppliers with the largest individual supplier providing 13% of the Southern Tide products in Fiscal 2018. Also, the largest 10 suppliers of Southern Tide provided 55% of the Southern Tide products acquired, and approximately 55% of Southern Tide apparel products were sourced from China. 
Advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy for the Southern Tide brand, and we therefore devote significant resources to advertising and marketing. Southern Tide's advertising attempts to engage individuals within the brand's consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our e-commerce website and wholesale customers' stores and websites in search of our products. The marketing of the Southern Tide brand includes email, internet and social media advertising as well as traditional media such as catalogs, print and other correspondence with customers and moving media and trade show initiatives. We believe that it is very important that a lifestyle brand effectively communicate with consumers on a regular basis about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen the brand's connections with consumers. For certain of our wholesale customers, we also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our branded products at their retail locations and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs. Additionally, Southern Tide enters into certain sponsorship or co-branding arrangements, which may be for a particular cause or non-profit organization, that the Southern Tide team believes will resonate with its target consumers.

Southern Tide utilizes our owned distribution center in Lyons, Georgia for its warehouse and distribution center operations. Activities at the distribution center include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to wholesale customers and our e-commerce customers as well as embroidery of certain collegiate, corporate and golf related products. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory at the distribution center to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked orders and some limited replenishment ordering for our wholesale customers.
Wholesale Operations
At this time, Southern Tide's business is predominantly a wholesale business with sales to independent specialty stores, department stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores. Southern Tide's wholesale operations provide an opportunity to grow our business and have access to a large group of consumers. During Fiscal 2018, approximately 16% of Southern Tide's sales were to department stores and 10% of net sales were to Southern Tide Signature Stores. Southern Tide's net sales to its ten largest wholesale customers represented 39% of Southern Tide's net sales in Fiscal 2018, with its largest customer representing 12% of Southern Tide's net sales. Southern Tide products are available in more than 1,000 retail locations. 
A key component of Southern Tide's plans for growth in wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For Signature Stores, we enter into agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Southern Tide Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all the store specifically for Southern Tide products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. We sell products to these Southern Tide Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of February 2, 2019, there were 14 Signature Stores including stores in Massachusetts, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. We anticipate additional Signature Stores opening in Fiscal 2019. In addition, we believe there is opportunity for wholesale growth for Southern Tide in women's apparel, which represented 15% of Southern Tide's net sales in Fiscal 2018. 
We maintain Southern Tide apparel sales offices and showrooms in Greenville, South Carolina. Our wholesale operations for Southern Tide utilize a sales force consisting of a combination of salaried sales employees and commissioned agents.
Direct to Consumer Operations
A key component of our Southern Tide growth strategy is to expand our direct to consumer operations, which currently consist of the Southern Tide website. The Southern Tide website markets a full line of merchandise, including apparel and accessories, all presented in a manner intended to enhance the Southern Tide image, brand awareness and acceptance. We believe our Southern Tide website enables us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers. Additionally, we are exploring the feasibility of opening company owned Southern Tide stores in the future. 
In addition to off-price retailers, we also utilize the Southern Tide website as a means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory in a brand appropriate manner. During the year, we have a number of e-commerce flash clearance sales per year, which are typically in industry end of season promotional periods. 
Licensing Operations
We currently license the Southern Tide trademark to licensees for certain bed, bath and tie product categories. The agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty payments based on specified percentages of the licensee's net sales of the licensed products and provides us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution. In the long term, we believe licensing may be an attractive business opportunity for Southern Tide, but opportunities may be somewhat limited until the sales volume and distribution of the Southern Tide brand expands. Once the brand is more fully established, licensing requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. 
Seasonal Aspects of Business
Southern Tide's operating results are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style as well as the demand by distribution channel may vary significantly depending on the time of year. Southern Tide is primarily a wholesale apparel business and currently has a heavier concentration of Spring/Summer product category offerings. Thus, the seasonality of Southern Tide generally reflects stronger sales in the first half of the fiscal year. The timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments or other factors affecting the business may vary from one year to the next. Therefore, we do not believe that net sales or operating income of Southern Tide for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for Fiscal 2018 are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. The following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income for Southern Tide by quarter for Fiscal 2018:
19


 | First Quarter | Second Quarter | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Net sales | 30 | % | 26 | % | 21 | % | 23 | %
Operating income | 44 | % | 25 | % | 9 | % | 22 | %

Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, the elimination of inter-segment sales and any other items that are not allocated to the operating groups including LIFO accounting adjustments. Because our LIFO inventory pool does not correspond to our operating group definitions, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to the operating groups. Corporate and Other also includes the operations of other businesses which are not included in our operating groups. The operations of TBBC and our Lyons, Georgia distribution center are included in Corporate and Other. TBBC, which we acquired in December 2017, designs, sources, markets and distributes premium childrenswear including bonnets, hats, apparel, swimwear and accessories through the TBBC e-commerce website, thebeaufortbonnetcompany.com, as well as wholesale specialty retailers. 
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations include the assets and operations of our former Ben Sherman operating group which we sold in July 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other information in this report reflect continuing operations and exclude any amounts related to the discontinued operations of our former Ben Sherman operating group. Refer to Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information about discontinued operations. We do not anticipate any cash flows or earnings related to discontinued operations in future periods. 
TRADEMARKS
We own trademarks, many of which are very important and valuable to our business including Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide. Generally, our trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on apparel and, in some cases, apparel-related products, accessories, home furnishings and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services. We continue to evaluate our worldwide usage and registration of our trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services in the relevant jurisdiction and the required registration renewals are filed. Important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
PRODUCT SOURCING AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
We intend to maintain flexible, diversified, cost-effective sourcing operations that provide high-quality apparel and related products. Our operating groups, either internally or through the use of third party buying agents, source virtually all of our apparel and related products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries, with a significant concentration in Asia. During Fiscal 2018, approximately 54% and 15% of our apparel and related products, excluding restaurant products, acquired directly by us or via buying agents, were from producers located in China and Vietnam, respectively, with no other country representing more than 10% of such purchases. We expect that the percentage of our products sourced from producers located in China will decrease in future years. Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers of apparel and related products and have used many of our suppliers for a number of years, generally we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. Instead, we conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Thus, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We believe that this approach provides us with the greatest flexibility in identifying the appropriate manufacturers while considering quality, cost, timing of product delivery and other criteria. We generally acquire products sold in our restaurant operations from various third party domestic suppliers. During Fiscal 2018, no individual third party manufacturer, licensee or other supplier provided more than 10% of our product purchases.
We purchase virtually all of our apparel and related products from third party producers as package purchases of finished goods, which are manufactured with oversight by us or our third party buying agents and to our design and fabric specifications. The use of contract manufacturers reduces the amount of capital investment required by us, as operating manufacturing facilities can require a significant amount of capital investment. We depend on the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of specified raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. We believe that purchasing substantially all of our products as package purchases allows us to reduce our working capital requirements as we are not required to purchase, or finance the purchase of, the raw materials or other production costs related to our apparel and related product purchases until we take ownership of the finished goods, which typically occurs when the goods are shipped by the third party producers. In addition to 
20

purchasing products from third parties, our Lanier Apparel operating group operates an owned manufacturing facility located in Merida, Mexico, which produced 2% of our total company products during Fiscal 2018.
As the design, manufacture and transportation of apparel and related products for our brands may take as many as six months for each season, we typically make commitments months in advance of when products will arrive in our retail stores or our wholesale customers' stores. We continue to seek ways to reduce the time required from design and ordering to bringing products to our customers. As our merchandising departments must estimate our requirements for finished goods purchases for our own retail stores and e-commerce sites based on historical product demand data and other factors, and as purchases for our wholesale accounts must be committed to prior to the receipt of customer orders, we carry the risk that we have purchased more inventory than will ultimately be desired or that we will not have purchased sufficient inventory to satisfy demand, resulting in lost sales opportunities.
As part of our commitment to source our products in a lawful, ethical and socially responsible manner, each of our operating groups has implemented a code of conduct program applicable to vendors from whom we purchase apparel and related products, which includes provisions related to abiding by applicable laws as well as compliance with other business or ethical standards, including related human rights, health, safety, working conditions, environmental and other requirements. We require that each of our vendors and licensees comply with the applicable code of conduct or substantially similar compliance standards. All of our vendors from whom we purchase goods are also required by us to adhere to the United States Customs and Border Protection’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program, including standards relating to facility, procedural, personnel and cargo security. On an ongoing basis we assess vendors' compliance with the applicable code of conduct and applicable laws and regulations through audits performed by either our employees or our designated agents. The assessment of compliance by vendors is directed by our corporate leadership team. In the event we determine that a vendor is not abiding by our required standards, we work with the vendor to remediate the violation. If the violation is not satisfactorily remediated, we will discontinue use of the vendor.

IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
We are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations as substantially all of our merchandise, as well as the products purchased by our licensing partners, is manufactured by foreign suppliers. During Fiscal 2018, approximately 54% and 15% of our apparel and related products, excluding restaurant products, acquired directly by us or via buying agents, were from producers located in China and Vietnam, respectively, with no other country representing more than 10% of such purchases. Products imported by us, or imported by others and ultimately sold to us, are subject to customs, trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the United States and other countries where we sell our products, including various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern any of our activities that may have adverse environmental, health and safety effects. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant monetary penalties.
Substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to certain duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product. These amounts represent a component of the inventories we sell and are included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations. We paid total duties of more than $40 million on products imported into the United States directly by us in Fiscal 2018, with the average duty rate on those products of approximately 15% of the value of the imported product. Duty rates vary depending on the type of garment, fiber content and country of origin and are subject to change in future periods. In addition, while the World Trade Organization's member nations have eliminated quotas on apparel and textiles, the United States and other countries into which we import our products are still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose "anti-dumping" or "countervailing" duties in response to threats to their comparable domestic industries.
Although we have not been materially inhibited from doing business in desired markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and brands and enter into new markets. In addition, in recent years the United States government has implemented additional duties on certain product categories across various industries and there continues to be discussion of potential additional duties or other changes to duties applicable to the apparel industry. There remains a significant amount of uncertainty related to these topics; however, it is possible that changes, if implemented, could have a significant unfavorable impact on the apparel retail industry and our cost of goods sold, operations, net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Our management regularly monitors proposed regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment, including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products. As a result of these changes and increased costs of production in certain countries that unfavorably impact our cost of goods sold, we continue to make changes in our supply chain, including exiting certain factories and sourcing those apparel or related products from a factory in a different foreign country. 
In addition, apparel and other related products sold by us are subject to stringent and complex product performance and security and safety standards, laws and other regulations. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, 
21

certification of product safety and importer security procedures. We believe that we are in material compliance with those regulations. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also generally subject to such regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations.
Important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
We believe that sophisticated information systems and functionality are important components of maintaining our competitive position and supporting continued growth of our businesses, particularly in the ever-changing consumer shopping environment. Our information systems are designed to provide effective retail store, e-commerce, restaurant and wholesale operations while emphasizing efficient point-of-sale, distribution center, design, sourcing, order processing, marketing, customer relationship management, accounting and other functions. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our information technologies and upgrade or enhance our systems to gain operating efficiencies, to provide additional consumer access and to support our anticipated growth as well as other changes in our business. We believe that continuous upgrading and enhancements to our information systems with newer technology that offers greater efficiency, functionality and reporting capabilities is critical to our operations and financial condition.
SEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS
Each of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. For details of the impact of seasonality on each of our operating groups, see the business discussion of each operating group above. 
As the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments, weather or other factors affecting our operations may vary from one year to the next, we do not believe that net sales or operating income for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for Fiscal 2018 are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. Our third quarter has historically been our smallest net sales and operating income quarter and that result is expected to continue. The following table presents our percentage of net sales and operating results by quarter for Fiscal 2018:

 | FirstQuarter | SecondQuarter | ThirdQuarter | FourthQuarter
Net sales | 25 | % | 27 | % | 21 | % | 27 | %
Operating income | 31 | % | 40 | % | 4 | % | 25 | %

ORDER BACKLOG
As two-thirds of our sales are direct to consumer sales, which are not reflected in an order backlog, and the order backlog for wholesale sales may be impacted by a variety of factors, we do not believe that order backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods. Therefore, we believe the order backlog is not material for an understanding of our business taken as a whole. Further, as our sales continue to shift towards direct to consumer rather than wholesale sales, the order backlog will continue to be less meaningful as a measure of our future sales and results of operations.
EMPLOYEES
As of February 2, 2019, we employed approximately 6,100 persons, of whom approximately 85% were employed in the United States. Approximately 70% of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees. We believe our employee relations are good.
