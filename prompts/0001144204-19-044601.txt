Products
 
The Company’s products (“Products”) are comprised of the following:
 
The Company designs, engineers, manufactures and markets the software and control panels discussed above. It also buys and resells various identification readers, PC-based computers and various peripheral equipment for access control systems.
Door Security Products. The Company manufactures a variety of door locking devices including microprocessor-based electronic door locks with push button, card reader and bio-metric operation, door alarms, mechanical door locks and simple dead bolt locks. These devices may control a single door or, in the case of some of the Company’s microprocessor-based door locks, may be networked with the Company’s access control systems and controlled remotely.
Intrusion and Fire Alarm Systems. Alarm systems usually consist of various detectors, a control panel, a digital keypad and signaling equipment. When a break-in occurs, an intrusion detector senses the intrusion and activates a control panel via hard-wired or wireless transmission that sets off the signaling equipment and, in most cases, causes a bell or siren to sound. Communication equipment such as a digital communicator may be used to transmit the alarm signal to a central station or another person selected by a customer.
 
The Company manufactures and markets the following products for alarm systems:
 
Automatic Communicators. When a control panel is activated by a signal from an intrusion detector, it activates a communicator that can automatically dial one or more pre-designated telephone numbers utilizing wired (“landline”) or cellular communications systems. If programmed to do so, a digital communicator dials the telephone number of a central monitoring station and communicates in computer language to a digital communicator receiver, which signals an alarm message.
 
Cellular communication devices. A cellular communication device connects to the communicator and is used in lieu of, or in addition to, a landline for communicating with a central monitoring station.
 
Control Panels. A control panel is the "brain" of an alarm system. When activated by any one of the various types of intrusion detectors, it can activate an audible alarm and/or various types of communication devices.
Combination Control Panels/Digital Communicators and Digital Keypad Systems. A combination control panel, digital communicator and a digital keypad has continued to be the leading configuration in terms of dealer and consumer preference. Benefits of the combination format include the cost efficiency resulting from a single microcomputer function, as well as the reliability and ease of installation gained from the simplicity and sophistication of micro-computer technology.
Fire Alarm Control Panel. Multi-zone fire alarm control panels, which accommodate an optional digital communicator for reporting to a central station, are also manufactured by the Company.
 
Area Detectors. The Company's area detectors are both passive infrared heat detectors and combination microwave/passive infrared detectors that are linked to alarm control panels. Passive infrared heat detectors respond to the change in heat patterns caused by an intruder moving within a protected area. Combination units respond to both changes in heat patterns and changes in microwave patterns occurring at the same time.
 
Cellular communication services. The Company provides cellular access for the cellular communication devices described above. These services are provided and invoiced on a month to month basis.
 
Access Control Systems. Access control systems consist of one or more of the following: various types of identification readers (e.g. card readers, hand scanners), a control panel, a PC-based computer and electronically activated door-locking devices. When an identification card or other identifying information is entered into the reader, the information is transmitted to the control panel/PC which then validates the data and determines whether or not to grant access by electronically deactivating the door locking device. An electronic log is kept which records various types of data regarding access activity.
Video Surveillance Systems. Video surveillance systems typically consist of one or more video cameras, a control panel and a video monitor or PC. More advanced systems can also include a recording device and some type of remote communication device such as an internet connection to a PC or browser-enabled cell phone. The system allows the user to monitor various locations at once while recorders save the video images for future use. Remote communication devices can allow the user to view and control the system from a remote location. The Company designs, engineers, and markets the software and control panels discussed above. It also buys and resells various video cameras, PC-based computers and peripheral equipment for video surveillance systems.
Peripheral Equipment 
 
The Company also markets peripheral and related equipment manufactured by other companies. Revenues from peripheral equipment have not been significant.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company's business involves a high technology element. Research and development (“R&D”) costs incurred by the Company are charged to expense as incurred and are included in "Operating expenses" in the consolidated statements of operations. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company expended approximately $7,212,000 and $6,630,000, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development activities conducted primarily by its engineering department to develop and improve the Products. The Company intends to continue to conduct a significant portion of its future research and development activities internally.
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had 1,076 full-time employees.
 
Marketing
 
The Company's staff of 58 sales and marketing support employees located at the Company's Amityville offices sells and markets the Products primarily to independent distributors and wholesalers of security alarm and security hardware equipment. Management estimates that these channels of distribution represented approximately 57%, and 54% of the Company's total sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The remaining revenues are primarily from installers and governmental institutions. The Company's sales representatives periodically contact existing and potential customers to introduce new products and create demand for those as well as other Company products. These sales representatives, together with the Company's technical personnel, provide training and other services to wholesalers and distributors so that they can better service the needs of their customers. In addition to direct sales efforts, the Company advertises in technical trade publications and participates in trade shows in major United States and European cities.
 



In the ordinary course of the Company's business the Company grants extended payment terms to certain customers. The Company had one customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised 19% and 22% of the Company’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales to this customer comprised 10% of net sales in each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The Company had another customer with an accounts receivable balance that comprised 11% of the Company’s accounts receivable at both June 30, 2019 and 2018. Sales to this customer did not exceed 10% for fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. For further discussion on Concentration of Credit Risk see disclosures included in Item 1A and Item 7.
 
Competition
 
The security products industry is highly competitive. The Company's primary competitors are comprised of approximately 12 other companies that manufacture and market security equipment to distributors, dealers, central stations and original equipment manufacturers. The Company believes that no one of these competitors is dominant in the industry. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company.
 
The Company competes primarily on the basis of the features, quality, reliability and pricing of, and the incorporation of the latest innovative and technological advances into, its Products. The Company also competes by offering technical support services to its customers. In addition, the Company competes on the basis of its expertise, its proven products, its reputation and its ability to provide Products to customers on a timely basis. The inability of the Company to compete with respect to any one or more of the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's business.
 
Relatively low-priced "do-it-yourself" alarm system products are available to the public at retail stores. The Company believes that these products compete with the Company only to a limited extent because they appeal primarily to the "do-it-yourself" segment of the market. Purchasers of such systems do not receive professional consultation, installation, service or the sophistication that the Company's Products provide.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Historically, the end users of the Company’s products want to install its products prior to the summer; therefore sales of its products historically peak in the period April 1 through June 30, the Company's fiscal fourth quarter, and are reduced in the period July 1 through September 30, the Company's fiscal first quarter. In addition, demand is affected by the housing and construction markets. Deterioration of the current economic conditions may also affect this trend.
Raw Materials
 
The Company prepares specifications for component parts used in the Products and purchases the components from outside sources or fabricates the components itself. These components, if standard, are generally readily available; if specially designed for the Company, there is usually more than one alternative source of supply available to the Company on a competitive basis. The Company generally maintains inventories of all critical components. The Company for the most part is not dependent on any one source for its raw materials. The Company believes that any vendor that is currently the sole source of a component can be replaced without a material impact on the Company.
Sales Backlog
 
In general, orders for the Products are processed by the Company from inventory. A sales backlog of approximately $992,000 and $2,151,000 existed as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company expects to fill the entire backlog that existed as of June 30, 2019 during fiscal 2020.
Government Regulation
 
The Company's telephone dialers, microwave transmitting devices utilized in its motion detectors and any new communication equipment that may be introduced from time to time by the Company must comply with standards promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") in the United States and similar agencies in other countries where the Company offers such products, specifying permitted frequency bands of operation, permitted power output and periods of operation, as well as compatibility with telephone lines. Each new Product that is subject to such regulation must be tested for compliance with FCC standards or the standards of such similar governmental agencies. Test reports are submitted to the FCC or such similar agencies for approval. Cost of compliance with these regulations has not been material.
Patents and Trademarks 
 
The Company has been granted several patents and trademarks relating to the Products. While the Company obtains patents and trademarks as it deems appropriate, the Company does not believe that its current or future success is dependent on its patents or trademarks.
Foreign Sales
 
The revenues and identifiable assets attributable to the Company's domestic and foreign operations for its last two fiscal years are summarized in the following table:
