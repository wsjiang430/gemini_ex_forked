Corporate Structure

We were incorporated as Cetrone Energy Company on January 28, 2008 in the State of Nevada. From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of Fresh Start Private, Inc. (“FSP”), the principal business of the Company originally was to develop “green” renewable fuel sources for agricultural operations, specifically biodiesel. On July 26, 2010, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to Fresh Start Private Management, Inc. During that time, we had no revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. As a result of the reverse acquisition of FSP, on October 31, 2011, we ceased our prior operations and we are now a holding company and our wholly owned subsidiary engages in alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment through our BioCorRx® Recovery Program and related products.

On October 31, 2011, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with FSP (“Share Exchange”) whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of FSP in exchange for 37,000,000 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 31.3% of our total shares outstanding immediately following the closing of the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, FSP became our wholly-owned subsidiary.

The Share Exchange was treated as a reverse acquisition, with FSP as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of FSP.

On January 7, 2014, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to BioCorRx Inc.

Effective July 5, 2016, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of capital stock of the Company from two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of common stock, and eighty thousand (80,000) shares of preferred stock, both $.001 par value respectively, to five hundred twenty five million (525,000,000) shares common stock ($0.001 par value), and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock (no par value), respectively.

On July 28, 2016, we formed BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals”), for the purpose of developing certain business lines. In connection with its formation, 24.2% of BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals’ outstanding shares of common stock were issued to officers of the Company with the Company retaining 75.8%.

On November 23, 2016, the Company filed a certificate of designations, rights and preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada pursuant to which the Company set forth the designation, powers, rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of the Series B Preferred Stock.

On January 16, 2018, majority shareholders holding 59% of the voting equity voted to amend the Company’s articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of capital stock of the Company from five hundred twenty five million (525,000,000) shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share, and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, to seven hundred fifty million (750,000,000) shares of common stock ($0.001 par value per share) and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock ($0.001 par value per share) (“Share Increase”). The Share Increase took effect on May 10, 2018.

On January 16, 2018, majority shareholders holding 59% of the voting equity voted to grant discretionary authority to the Board of Directors of the Company (“Board”), at any time or times for a period of 12 months after the date of the written consent, to adopt an amendment to our articles of incorporation to effect a reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in a range of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-500. On January 16, 2019, the Board approved an amendment to the articles of incorporation to effect a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (“Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and subsequently approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on January 18, 2019 and took effect on January 22, 2019. All share and per share information in this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split, including the financial statements and notes thereto.

Business Overview

BioCorRx Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops and provides innovative treatment programs for substance abuse and related disorders. The BioCorRx® Recovery Program is a non-addictive, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program for substance abuse that includes peer recovery support. The UnCraveRx™ Weight Loss Management Program is a medically assisted weight management program that is combined with a virtual platform application. The Company is also engaged in the research and development of sustained release naltrexone products for the treatment of addiction and other possible disorders. Specifically, the company is developing its product candidate (BICX101) a sustained release, injectable naltrexone for the treatment of opioid abuse and alcoholism. The company is also developing an implantable naltrexone treatment (BICX104) a long-acting naltrexone implant that can last several months for the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol use disorders with the goal of future regulatory approval with the Food and Drug Administration.

The BioCorRx® Recovery Program is a comprehensive addiction program which includes peer support and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) modules (typically completed in 16 sessions on average but not limited to), coupled with a naltrexone implant. CBT is an evidence-based method that can be used to change thoughts, feelings, behaviors and improve overall life satisfaction. The implant is specifically compounded with a prescription from a medical doctor for each individual and is designed to release naltrexone into the body over multiple months. The naltrexone implant means a single administration, long-acting naltrexone pellet(s) that consists of a naltrexone formulation in a biodegradable form that is suitable for subcutaneous implantation in a particular patient.

BioCorRx is not a licensed health care provider and does not provide health care services to patients. BioCorRx does not operate substance abuse clinics. BioCorRx makes the BioCorRx Recovery Program and UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program available to health care providers to utilize when the health care provider determines it is medically appropriate and indicated for his or her patients. Any physician or medical professional is solely responsible for treatment options prescribed or recommended to his or her patients. At all times, such providers retain complete and exclusive authority, responsibility, supervision and control over their medical practice, their patients, the treatment that their patients receive and any decision to prescribe the implant to any of the provider’s patients.

BioCorRx does not condition its license to health care providers accessing the implant on their making available the Counseling Program to the providers’ patients although BioCorRx certainly encourages that providers do so.

BioCorRx has issued several license and distribution agreements to several unrelated third parties involving the establishment of alcoholism and opioid addiction rehabilitation and treatment centers and creating certain addiction rehabilitation programs. There are 15 licensed providers throughout the United States that offer the BioCorRx Recovery Program and 12 providers throughout the United States that offer the UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program. The company’s current focus will continue on wider distribution across the United States, branding of the BioCorRx Recovery Program and acquisition of healthcare related products and services. The Company is committed to continuing to provide excellent rehabilitation products and related services to healthcare providers nationwide as it expands the distribution of the BioCorRx Recovery Program and UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program to a network of independent licensed clinics and licensed healthcare professionals.

The Company’s subsidiary, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, is focused on acquiring and the development of products for the treatment of addiction and other possible disorders. Specifically, the company is developing injectable and implantable naltrexone with the goal of future regulatory approval with the Food and Drug Administration. The Company’s pipeline includes BICX101 for the treatment of opioid addiction and alcoholism as well as BICX104 for the same indications.

In August 2017, the Company announced that it had decided to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval on BICX102 in advance of BICX101. Product candidate BICX102 is a long-acting naltrexone implant that can last several months being developed for opioid dependence and alcohol use disorders. The pre-IND meeting date for BICX102 took place on January 24, 2018. On February 12, 2018, the Company announced that the FDA deemed the 505(b)(2) pathway as an acceptable route for approval for BICX102; the Company plans to apply for dual indications, both opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder, within the same application. A grant application was submitted to the National Institutes of Health on May 14, 2018 for funding the development and study plans for BICX102. On January 17, 2019, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) in support of BICX102 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provided for (i) $2,842,430 in funding during the first year and (ii) $2,831,838 during the second year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. In January 2020, the Company was awarded a second year of funding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) to support the development of a 3-month implantable depot pellet of naltrexone for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder, which the Company refers to as BICX102. The grant provided for $2,831,838 during the second year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and availability of funds. On August 27, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provides for $3,453,367 in funding during the third year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. On March 31, 2022, the Company received a Notice of Award from the United States Department of Health and Human Services for a grant from National Institute on Drug Abuse. The grant provides for $99,431 in additional funding during the third year subject to the terms and conditions specified in the grant, including satisfactory progress of project and the availability of funds. Grant receivables were $130,152 and $56,359 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deferred revenues related to the grant were $0 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. $1,789,496 and $835,924 were recorded as grant income during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program is a comprehensive 3-month medically assisted weight management program that helps to reduce food cravings combined with on-demand virtual lifestyle support, fitness and nutrition.

If determined medically appropriate by a patient’s treating physician and under his/her medical supervision, an anti-craving medication may be prescribed to help reduce food cravings. The benefits of using the anti-craving time released mediation is that it may aid in compliance. BioCorRx® does not sell, manufacture, or compound any drugs or pharmaceuticals for the program.

Training is required to assist the treating physician in making the best medical decision regarding the use of the anti-craving medication and determine whether the program is right for the patient.

Treatment Philosophy

Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program empowers patients to succeed. A detailed description of our treatment philosophy is as follows:


5

Medical Intervention: It is essential to significantly reduce a patient’s cravings for alcohol and opioids in order to fully break the cycle of addiction. We have built our BioCorRx® Recovery Program around a state-of-the-art, minimally invasive, biodegradable implant of naltrexone. The naltrexone medication is an FDA-approved pharmaceutical used for the treatment of alcoholism and opioid addiction. A licensed physician surgically inserts a marble-sized pellet(s) under the skin in the lower abdomen. The pellet is absorbed into the body and typically dissolves within months following the procedure in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors.
Focus on Treatment: Unlike many other addiction treatment programs, we focus primarily on the treatment of alcohol and opioid addiction.

Comprehensive Approach: Alcoholism and opioid addiction are complex diseases that needs a program specifically designed to treat the body, the mind, and the spirit of one suffering from addiction. We have created a comprehensive recovery program that includes state-of-the-art medical intervention, individually tailored peer support and cognitive behavioral therapy (“CBT”) counseling modules used by trained addiction specialists. Our program typically lasts for 6 months from the initial surgical procedure of inserting the naltrexone pellet(s) to the last peer support coaching session. We believe that through our comprehensive treatment method, clients will have the highest possible chances of full recovery from alcohol and opioid dependency.
Recovery Program Description

We offer a comprehensive and highly effective alcohol and opioid addiction treatment program. Our proprietary program is designed to offer treatment and healing to both the body and the mind of those suffering from addiction. Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program is a two-part program that includes: (i) the insertion of a naltrexone implant that is believed to reduce physical cravings of alcohol and opioids by a trained physician; and (ii) peer support and CBT that focuses on the psycho-social aspect of addiction. The following is a detailed description of our treatment program.
Naltrexone Implant: Our unique program has reduced physical cravings for numerous patients suffering from alcoholism and opioid addiction. Our implant is believed to reduce cravings over the period of multiple months in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors. During this time, the program focuses on addressing the mental dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. The implant is a naltrexone pellet(s) that is the size of a marble and inserted via an outpatient surgical procedure into the lower abdomen of the patient. The naltrexone pellets will be absorbed by the body over time and will automatically dissolve and not need to be removed unless otherwise required.

All procedures to place the naltrexone pellets into patients are performed at several independently owned and licensed provider locations. There are approximately 14 licensed providers throughout the United States that offer the BioCorRx Recovery Program. Locations of the provider locations offering our program can provided by calling our toll free number (888) 993-1099. The procedures are performed by a licensed medical professional.

The naltrexone implant is produced by select compounding pharmacies contracted by BioCorRx Inc. We entered into an asset purchase agreement (“Trinity Purchase Agreement”) dated August 20, 2018 with Trinity Compound Solutions, Inc. (“Trinity”). In accordance with the Trinity Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased the worldwide contractual rights, except for New Zealand and Australia, for the naltrexone implant formulation from Trinity. The purchase price for the naltrexone implant was $20,000 cash and 20,000 shares of the Common Stock. Half of the $20,000 was paid upon the transfer of the naltrexone implant formulation with no additional amount due or outstanding. The shares were issued in December 2018. The naltrexone implant is part of the Medication Assisted Treatment program (see above). This cannot be sold in New Zealand and Australia due to the limitations imposed by the Trinity Asset Purchase Agreement.

The naltrexone implant is one or two small pellets that are inserted beneath the skin in the subcutaneous fat located in the lower abdomen. The implant procedure is an outpatient procedure that takes approximately 20-30 minutes. A local anesthetic is administered before the pellets are implanted and the patient is free to leave the clinic and return to normal activities within a few hours of the procedure in most cases. The pellets are biodegradable and will gradually dissolve in the human body. The pellets contain a medicine called naltrexone, which has been shown to block receptors in the brain that crave alcohol and opioids. Naltrexone is an FDA approved medication and all patients are required to obtain a prescription for the medication from a medical doctor. The doctors employed by the licensed providers are responsible for evaluating the patients, determining if the patient is a candidate and, if so, writing the prescription. The prescription is then presented to compounding pharmacies contracted by BioCorRx that produce the pellets using naltrexone as the core ingredient. BioCorRx does not compound, manufacture or handle the naltrexone implants.

Once the pellet is implanted in the patient, they are usually free to return to work on the next business day and will be contacted by a peer support specialist and/or counselor within a few days if not prior to the procedure to begin the behavioral portion of the program.

BioCorRx Recovery Program CBT: We developed a CBT program to assist patients in addressing their dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. Prior to, or upon receiving the naltrexone implant, each patient will typically speak with a counselor/therapist. This counselor/therapist will treat the patient for the next several weeks following the implant using the program modules in combination with their own skill sets to help them cope with and address their dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. It usually takes approximately 16 sessions to complete the program modules.

As part of the peer support and CBT program, peer support specialists/counselors focus on bringing family and friends into the recovery process. This provides emotional support for patients and allows them to understand that they have people that care for them and want them to remain sober. The peer support portion of the program typically lasts for 6 months.

UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program

The UnCraveRx™ Weight Loss Management Program is a medically assisted weight management program that helps to reduce food cravings combined with on-demand virtual lifestyle support, fitness and nutrition. BioCorRx is not a licensed health care provider and does not provide health care services to patients. BioCorRx does not operate weight loss clinics. BioCorRx makes the UnCraveRx® Weight Loss Management Program available to health care providers to utilize when the health care provider determines it is medically appropriate and indicated for their patient(s). Any physician or licensed medical provider is solely responsible for treatment options prescribed or recommended to their patient(s). At all times, such providers retain complete and exclusive authority, responsibility, supervision and control over their medical practice, their patients, the treatment that their patients receive and any decision to prescribe medication to any of the provider’s patients.

If determined medically appropriate by a patient’s treating physician and under his/her medical supervision, an anti-craving medication may be prescribed to help reduce food cravings. The benefits of using the anti-craving time released medication is that it may aid in compliance. BioCorRx® does not sell, manufacture, or compound any drugs or pharmaceuticals for the program.

Training is required to assist the treating physician in making the best medical decision regarding the use of the anti-craving medication and determine whether the program is right for the patient.

Marketing Strategy

Our marketing strategy is a long-term, forward-looking approach to planning with the fundamental goal of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. We have and will continue to use a variety of advertising and on-line marketing channels to increase awareness and exposure to the BioCorRx® Recovery Program and UnCraveRx® amongst prospective medical professionals to grow our customer base and gain distinction in the medical community. Our commitment is to help medical professionals to offer viable options to their patients to achieve sustainable sobriety and live healthier lives.
Competition

We believe we are one of the leading companies offering medication assisted treatment for the treatment of substance use disorder, alcoholism and weight loss management.

Our MAT recovery program that is focused on substance abuse treatment in the United States is specific to naltrexone therapy. Many treatment providers operate in a broader behavioral healthcare sector without focusing primarily on substance abuse with MAT. We believe our core focus on MAT and scalable program gives us with an advantage over competitors in terms of building our brand and marketing our program to potential customers.

Our Weight Loss Management program is focused on weight management in the United States is specific to medication assisted treatment combined with a virtual platform that offers nutritional and fitness coaching as well as lifestyle support groups aimed to help sustain a healthier lifestyle.

We believe the primary competitive factors affecting our business include:

Growth Strategy

There has been a significant focus on increasing access to MAT for opioid addiction. The development of new effective treatments has risen and is of great importance given the devasting effects of opioid use disorder. In February 2018, the FDA announced its plan to expand MAT for opioid dependence by providing new guidance to the industry. We believe MAT is becoming more recognized as the gold standard of care for the treatment of substance use disorder. The intended purpose of MAT for opioid use disorder includes a decrease in illicit opioid use, decreased mortality, and improved long-term sobriety.

We have developed a program that we believe helps patients battle their mental and physical addiction to alcohol and opioids more effectively than traditional methods. We are currently operating in Anaheim, California and market nationally. We are constantly seeking and contracting with additional independent treatment providers in the United States and ramping up efforts to establish pilot programs with local and state government entities.

Obesity has become a serious concern and health problem in the United States. Approximately 35% of Americans are obese. Obesity has become an epidemic according to the CDC and has become associated with poor health outcomes. New treatment and choices to help individuals are needed to help lose weight or maintain their weight. We have developed UnCraveRx® that we believe will help patients in losing and maintaining weight. We currently market our program nationally and seek medical professionals to grow our network of providers.

Our strategic growth also includes product research and development pipelines with significant market opportunities being developed under our subsidiary BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals. Development of BICX104 is an essential element to grow the business and gain payer acceptance; the product candidate is a long-acting naltrexone implant that can last several months being developed for opioid dependence and alcohol use disorders.

Government Regulation and Approvals

All surgical procedures need to be performed by a licensed physician or medical professional.

The naltrexone implant does not require regulatory approval because naltrexone is already an FDA approved medication. Once the physician writes a prescription for naltrexone implant, a pharmacist can put it into a compounded form under U.S. compounding laws and then distribute the compounded medication directly to the ordering physician treating the intended patient. The pharmacy is required to be properly licensed in each state to which the implant is being distributed. BioCorRx® does not sell, manufacture, or compound any drugs or pharmaceuticals.

FDA approval is required for BICX104.

Intellectual Property/Licensing Rights

On August 20, 2018, we entered into the Trinity Compound Solutions, Inc. (“Trinity”) Purchase Agreement with Trinity. In accordance with the Trinity Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased the worldwide contractual rights, except for New Zealand and Australia, for the naltrexone implant formulation from Trinity. The purchase price for the naltrexone implant was $20,000 cash and 20,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Half of the $20,000 was paid upon the transfer of the naltrexone implant formulation with no additional amount due or outstanding. The shares were issued in December 2018. The naltrexone implant is part of the MAT program (see above). This specific formulation cannot be sold in New Zealand and Australia due to the limitations imposed by the Trinity Purchase Agreement.

On October 12, 2018, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company’s majority owned subsidiary, acquired $15,200 of Therakine Biodelivery GmBH patent families consisting of approximately 11 patents pending and 1 issued patent. The patent families are subject to a Development, Commercialization and License agreement between the Company and Therakine, Ltd. These patents were first licensed to the Company in July 2018 and subsequently were purchased in October 2018.

The Company tested the intellectual property during the third quarter of 2021 and determined that, based on its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intellectual property is less than the carrying value, and thus recorded $141,480 impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2021, which brings the carrying value of the intellectual property to $0.
