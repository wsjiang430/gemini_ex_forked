Our innovative orthopedic solutions, procedural approaches and instrumentation cover a wide range of foot and ankle ailments including fracture fixation, forefoot or hallux valgus - which includes bunion and hammertoe, ankle, flatfoot or progressive collapsing foot deformity (PCFD), charcot foot and orthobiologics. To treat these painful, debilitating or even life-threatening conditions, we provide a comprehensive portfolio of solutions that includes surgical implants and disposables, as well as surgical instrumentation. As of December 31, 2022 our broad suite of surgical solutions comprises 75 product systems, including approximately 9,200 SKUs to help fit the specific needs of each patient and procedure. We design each of our products with both the patient and surgeon in mind, with the goal of improving outcomes, reducing ailment recurrence and complication rates, and making the procedures simpler, consistent and reproducible. We believe our passion, expertise, and exclusive focus in the foot and ankle market has allowed us to better understand the needs of our patients and physicians, which has enabled us to create innovations and enhanced solutions that disrupt and transform the foot and ankle market. As a result, we have experienced significant growth and momentum in our business.
The global market for surgical implants and devices used in foot and ankle procedures was approximately $4.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at approximately 7% annually to reach approximately $6.0 billion by 2026, representing the fastest growing market within orthopedics. The United States remains the largest market for foot and ankle procedures, representing approximately 55% of the global market in 2022, and is our largest market for product sales. Our estimates of the global foot and ankle market are based on internal and third-party data. We expect the foot and ankle market to benefit from general trends including an aging population, increased incidence of obesity and diabetes, as well as the broader patient populations’ desire to pursue a more active lifestyle. We also believe that growth in the foot and ankle market could accelerate with an increased focus on specialization and with advancements in technology that improve patient outcomes.
The foot and ankle market is a young and relatively new surgical specialty that is dominated by a handful of incumbents that operate across the broader medical device and orthopedic markets. The combination of a broad focus on orthopedics within a limited number of market participants has resulted in slow technological and procedural advancement that we believe is resulting from:
•lack of exclusive focus on the foot and ankle market; 
 •limited clinical education, understanding and consistent techniques for treating foot and ankle conditions; 
 •lack of specialized and clinically focused sales forces; 
 •lack of patient specific solutions; 
 •lack of advanced technologies; and 
 •lack of unbiased research. 
 We strive to disrupt and transform the market by focusing exclusively on the foot and ankle in order to develop and commercialize differentiated, high quality orthopedic solutions, advanced procedural approaches and instrumentation that are collectively designed to enable surgeons to provide consistent, reproducible and effective outcomes. Our development strategy integrates all aspects of the procedure and we seek to enhance support systems beyond implants. We develop procedure specific solutions featuring meaningfully improved and purpose-built designs for both implants and instrumentation, and enhanced surgical techniques and clinical support. We rely on an unbiased, clinical, research-first approach to developing new products, which allows us to develop disruptive technologies. Each of our systems is designed to deliver the surgeon an enhanced user-experience throughout the procedure, while improving patient outcomes and increasing the reproducibility of results. We couple this innovation and advancement with a dedication to medical education to support surgeons, patients and stakeholders within our organization, while also delivering our products through a clinically focused sales force.

We have developed a comprehensive portfolio of foot and ankle surgical systems and procedural techniques designed to address many of the conditions requiring surgery in the foot and ankle, including fracture fixation; forefoot or hallux valgus - which includes bunion and hammertoe; ankle; PCFD or flatfoot; charcot foot; and orthobiologics. Each system typically includes numerous plates, screws, staples, nails, advanced joint and bone replacements, orthobiologics, and other implantation instruments and disposables. Except for our total talus spacer, which is authorized for marketing under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), our marketed products are either Class II medical devices cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for specific indications or they are Class I exempt for general orthopaedic use. We have no products that are Class III medical devices. Since inception, we have designed and currently market 75 product systems with approximately 9,200 SKUs, which comprises of approximately 6,800 implants, 1,400 instruments and 1,000 disposable and other SKUs. Our products are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to best suit the individual patient’s anatomical and surgical requirements.
Since inception, we have introduced numerous key technological innovations and novel products that have advanced and challenged the status quo in our industry. As a result, many of our solutions have been first to market.

Our Industry
The foot and ankle are complex structures that combined contain 30 bones, with 28 in the foot alone, 34 joints and a network of more than 100 tendons, muscles and ligaments. While many foot and ankle problems can be successfully solved without surgery, many also require surgical intervention to resolve longstanding pain, deformities or correction of diseased tissue. In the United States, procedures to address conditions of the foot and ankle are typically performed by the following:
•approximately 2,400 orthopedic surgeons who specialize in foot and ankle; 
 •approximately 2,300 pediatric and trauma surgeons that treat foot and ankle; and 
 •approximately 9,000 surgical podiatrists in the US; approximately half of all surgical podiatrists in the US perform foot and ankle surgery. 
 The products used in foot and ankle procedures generally include screws, wires and pins, plates, nails, fixators, staples, joint implants, soft tissue implants, and orthobiologics. In addition to the diversity of tools, there are also multiple approaches to treating foot and ankle conditions. We believe the diversity of tools and treatment methodologies adds to the complexity of foot and ankle procedures and the varying degrees of patient outcomes.

Our definition of the foot and ankle market includes the treatment of the following conditions: 

Fracture Fixation | 
(Ankle fracture represented in imageabove) |  Condition: A fracture, or broken bone, can be a result of an injury or may occur with overuse (stress fracture) in any bone in the foot and ankle. Treatment(s): Surgical treatment of fractures includes reduction, or putting the bones back together, and securing the fracture with implants such as plates and screws. 
Hallux Valgus, or Bunions | 
 |  Condition: A common foot deformity where a bump develops on the inside of the foot at the big toe joint. The condition can progress to cause significant loss of function, pain and reduced quality of life. Treatment(s): Bunion surgery can vary based on severity of the deformity, patient factors and surgeon preference, but is primarily addressed through bone cuts, bone fusion and/or soft tissue correction. 
Hammertoe | 
 |  Condition: Hammertoes can affect all toes, but typically affects the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th toe, when a tendon imbalance causes the toe(s) to bend and contract. Often associated with bunions. Treatment(s): Surgical treatment of hammertoes can be achieved by fusing the bones in a straight position with pins, screws or other implants, or by addressing the tendon/soft tissue imbalance directly. 
Ankle | Ankle includes all non-fracture ankle conditions surrounding the ankle including surrounding soft tissue. Some conditions of the ankle are highlighted below 
Ankle — Ankle Arthritis | 
 |  Condition: Ankle arthritis is most commonly a result of trauma to the ankle, such as repeated ankle sprains or a previous ankle fracture. Treatment(s): Ankle arthritis is typically treated with either ankle arthrodesis, which is the fusion of the ankle joint using screws, plates, and/or intramedullary nailing, which is nail within the bone without any protrusion, or total ankle arthroplasty, which is the replacement of the ankle joint. Both total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis are intended to decrease pain in the ankle, but ankle joint replacement allows for the patient to continue moving their ankle. 
Ankle — Avascular Necrosis of the Ankle | 
 |  Condition: The talus bone sits beneath the tibia, forming the bottom of the ankle joint. The blood supply to the talus can be disrupted if the talus is fractured or if certain medications disrupt the flow of blood to this bone, which is termed avascular necrosis. Without blood to this bone, the bone dies and eventually collapses. The necrosed portion of this bone causes pain and must often be removed. Treatment(s): At worst, treatment may include amputation, but other options exist, such as a complicated fusion or alternative spacers in place of the talus. 


Progressive Collapsing Foot Deformity (PCFD), or Flatfoot
 |  Condition: A 3-dimensional foot deformity that is progressive in nature, affecting different parts of the foot to create a “fallen arch” appearance. Treatment(s): Correction of flatfoot may involve cutting and re-positioning bones, fusing bones together and/or repairing damaged soft tissues. 
Charcot Foot | 
 |  Condition: A rare condition that can develop in diabetic patients or others with longstanding peripheral neuropathy, which is a loss of sensation in the hands and feet. In people with charcot foot, the bones become weak, fracture, and/or dislocate without the patient feeling their foot. Treatment(s): Surgical treatment may be complex, including bone cuts to help the foot become realigned and reduce pressure points for ulcer prevention/treatment. The bones may be fixed with internal fixation, such as plates, nails, beams, and screws, external fixation, or a combination of both. 
Orthobiologics | 
 |  Orthobiologics are biological substances used to help injuries and conditions heal more quickly across all major procedural segments within foot and ankle. Orthobiologics come in many forms including bone wedges, grafts, demineralized bone matrices, bone void fillers, synthetic materials, amniotic products, and a biocompatible collagen matrix. 

 Our Market Opportunity
We define our market as the market for surgical implants and devices used in foot and ankle procedures across all major indications, which include fracture fixation, forefoot or hallux valgus - which includes bunion and hammertoe, ankle, PCFD or flatfoot, charcot foot and orthobiologics. We believe each of these subsegments and orthobiologics represents its own market opportunity with varying growth rates. The global market for surgical implants and devices used in foot and ankle procedures was approximately $4.6 billion in 2022, and is projected to grow at approximately 7% annually to reach $6.0 billion by 2026, representing potentially the fastest growing market within orthopedics. The United States remains the largest market for foot and ankle procedures, representing approximately 55% of the global market in 2022, and is our largest market for product sales. Our estimates of the global foot and ankle market are based on internal and third-party data.
 

The broader global foot and ankle market opportunity across each major indication and orthobiologics is shown in the table below.

 | Estimated | | Estimated | | | Projected
 | 2022 Market size | | 2026 Market size | | | 2022-2026
Foot and Ankle Market Segment | (in millions) | | CAGR | 
Fracture Fixation | $ | 1,400 | | $ | 1,700 | | 5 | %
Forefoot or hallux valgas (1) | $ | 1,500 | | $ | 2,200 | | 9 | %
Ankle (2) | $ | 500 | | $ | 700 | | 9 | %
Flatfoot or PCFD | $ | 400 | | $ | 400 | | 3 | %
Charcot Foot | $ | 200 | | $ | 200 | | 4 | %
Orthobiologics (3) | $ | 600 | | $ | 800 | | | %
Total Global Market | $ | 4,600 | | $ | 6,000 | | | %

 ------------------------------------------
 (1) Forefoot includes hallux valgus (bunions) and hammertoe.
 (2) Ankle includes all non-fracture ankle conditions surrounding the ankle including surrounding soft tissue
 (3) Represents orthobiologics specific to the foot and ankle market.
We believe the foot and ankle market remains underpenetrated today due to high failure and recurrence rates experienced by patients. For example, revision rates for total ankle arthroplasty are 21.8% after 5 years and 43.5% after 10 years irrespective of the implant compared to approximately 0.9% and 1.4% after three years for hip and knee procedures, respectively. Revision rates across other foot and ankle procedures vary, but also are generally higher than other orthopedic markets. We estimate that revision rates for certain foot and ankle procedures can be as high as approximately 20% to 70%.
Despite these high failure rates, we believe that the foot and ankle market growth will accelerate due to advancements in technology and an increased focus and specialization in foot and ankle ailments, improving patient outcomes and patient awareness of available treatments. We also expect the market to benefit from general trends including an aging population, increased incidence of obesity and diabetes, as well as the broader patient populations’ desire to pursue a more active lifestyle.
Limitations of Existing Approaches in the Foot and Ankle Market
The foot and ankle surgical implant and device market is a relatively new segment of the orthopedic market and is dominated by a handful of incumbents who also operate across the broader medical technology and orthopedic markets. We believe technological advancement and growth in this market has been limited by certain trends in the industry, including:
•Lack of Sole Focus on and Dedication to Improving Outcomes in the Foot and Ankle Market. 
 Many of the current incumbent providers operate across multiple sectors both within orthopedics, as well as other medical technology segments, and they have not traditionally created technologies designed exclusively for the foot and ankle surgeon. Typically, these incumbents include their foot and ankle products within broader orthopedic divisions where sales and development teams are allocating time and resources to a broad array of solutions across multiple anatomies beyond the foot and ankle.
•Lack of Overall Education and Awareness of Optimal Approaches for Treating Foot and Ankle Conditions, Resulting in Higher Failure and Recurrence Rates.
 Foot and ankle is an emerging segment of orthopedics and its patients within this segment experience high recurrence and failure rates that can be associated with a multitude of complications. We believe there has been a lack of focus on developing robust medical and clinical education platforms and curriculums aimed to benefit key stakeholders in foot and ankle.
•Lack of a Specialized Foot and Ankle Sales Force.
 Given the broad focus of other industry participants, foot and ankle surgeons are often dealing directly with full line orthopedic sales representatives rather than a dedicated foot and ankle sales specialist. While in more rural markets, a non-specialized sales force is common, in more concentrated markets we believe this dynamic may lead to suboptimal customer service and attentiveness.
•Lack of Procedural Support and Patient Specific Solutions. 
 Physicians treating patients with complex foot and ankle conditions are often required to re-purpose another solution for each patient, which may result in inconsistent patient outcomes. In addition, there is a general lack of supporting tools and instruments customized and specific to each patient and procedure. Surgeons have limited optionality for treating patients, which is problematic as there is a wide range of conditions with varying degrees of severity and patient-specific complicating factors such as age, weight and activity level. This lack of options can lead to both high and low severity patients receiving similar, often suboptimal treatment and patients receiving solutions that are not addressing patient-specific factors.
•Many Existing Solutions Are Repurposed from Other Large Joint Anatomies.
We believe that several options used in treating foot and ankle today are derived from and resemble implants and instruments used in other anatomies such as hip, knee or from general trauma. While these technologies are often highly regarded in their primary anatomies, they were not designed with the specific and complex anatomy of the foot and ankle in mind. There are larger force requirements and usually minimal soft tissue envelopes which can add to the complexity of treating the foot and ankle. We believe this lack of anatomically specific designs and implants has contributed to the high revision and failure rates experienced in our market.
•Advanced Technologies Not Fully Applied. 
 We believe that the foot and ankle market has seen limited investment in advanced technologies such as 3-D instrument and implant printing, data analytics, artificial intelligence and robotics. We believe there is a significant need for providers to gain access to such technologies to help make procedures more efficient and to provide patients with more reproducible and improved outcomes. Further, we believe many foot and ankle surgeons are increasingly demanding advanced data analytic solutions to complement surgical support across the full procedural continuum from pre-operative planning, to intra-operative solutions, and ultimately post-operative feedback.
•Lack of Unbiased Research. 
 A majority of implants utilized in foot and ankle today were developed without a specific, research-based need in mind. We believe many research projects conducted in foot and ankle were conducted to bolster marketing or were conducted to support adoption of existing products and procedural techniques, and as a result, such research could be biased. Due to this potential bias, we believe there is a need to reorient key stakeholders to design products and procedures based on meaningful, unbiased clinical research.
We believe the combination of these limitations has led to a lack of product innovation and patient specific solutions, resulting in significant unmet need.
At Paragon 28, we aim to disrupt and improve the overall foot and ankle market across all functions of our organization. We are exclusively focused on foot and ankle, with our product development philosophy centered on improving the limitations of existing foot and ankle products and procedures to advance the standard of care.
We believe our differentiating characteristics that allow us to address current market limitations and improve patient outcomes include:
•Exclusive focus on foot and ankle market 
 •Product development and designs to address issues identified through unbiased research 
•Dedication to improving the procedural experience for physicians and offering a range of specific options to address all patients’ needs as opposed to repurposed solutions 
 •Ambition for each of our anatomically specific foot and ankle solutions to be the standard of care 
 •Development and utilization of advanced technologies through Smart 28 
 •Commitment to clinical education of all stakeholders 
 •Highly focused and rigorously trained sales force

To bolster our internal Smart 28 ecosystem, we acquired the assets of Additive Orthopaedics in 2021, which provides our customers with exclusive access to the only 3-D printed, patient specific total talus spacer authorized for marketing pursuant to an approved HDE application. We also acquired a proprietary, pre-operative surgical planning platform, which we believe may significantly accelerate our ability to leverage AI to improve clinical outcomes. In addition, with the Disior acquisition in the first quarter of 2022, we acquired a leading three-dimensional analytics pre-operative planning software company based in Helsinki, Finland. With the addition of both Additive Orthopaedics and Disior, we now have capabilities within the pre-operative and intra-operative stages of the continuum of care.
We expect to continue to invest in Smart 28 with the intent of developing post-operative solutions, while further bolstering our capabilities and offerings within the preoperative and intraoperative stages.
Our Procedurally Focused Systems
We have developed a comprehensive portfolio of foot and ankle surgical systems. Each system typically includes one or more of the following: plates, screws, staples, nails, advanced joint and bone replacements, orthobiologics, and other implantation instruments and disposables specifically designed for the particular surgical system. We focus our engineering efforts equally on each component of our surgical systems, from the implants to the procedural approach and instruments. Since inception, we have designed and currently market 75 product systems and approximately 9,200 SKUs. We have developed approximately 6,800 implant, 1,400 instrument, and 1,000 disposable and other SKU’s. Our products are available in a variety of sizes and configurations to best suit the individual patient’s anatomical and surgical requirements.
Our Plating Systems
We currently offer three plating systems: Gorilla Plating System, Baby Gorilla Plating System and Silverback Ankle Fusion Plating System. These plating systems are used in all major procedural segments within the foot and ankle industry. Our plates were created with the patient and surgeon in mind and designed to eliminate hardware irritation and the need for plate manipulation to help enhance surgical outcomes. Our plates are generally optimized to be procedure-specific with varying degrees of thickness to best suit the anatomical requirements of each patient and surgery. Our anatomically contoured plates are machine contoured, which we believe results in stronger, more balanced constructs with a better fit when compared to plates that are stamped, rolled, or bent. In order to complement our plates, drive clinical value, and enhance reproducibility, we offer complete all-in-one caddies containing the implants and procedure-specific instruments that surgeons will likely utilize in the procedure. A number of our plating systems include many patented features.
Our leading plating system is the Gorilla Plating System (Gorilla). Gorilla is one of the most comprehensive foot and ankle plating systems with over 290 plating options and a wide variety of plate-specific screws.

 In a retrospective study that we funded but for which we did not participate in the data collection or the ultimate publication in Foot & Ankle International in 2019, our Gorilla Plating System demonstrated strong clinical value and surgical efficiency resulting in fewer hardware removals, higher rates of bone union, and a biomechanically stable fixation; of the 81 patients who received a Gorilla Calcaneal Slide Plate, a 100% union rate was noted, with only one plate removed due to a superficial wound infection (1.2%), and no plates were removed due to hardware failures. This retrospective study was not powered for statistical significance. One case of hardware removal was reported due to wound breakdown and the plate being exposed. All osteotomies healed without displacement or hardware failure.
The Gorilla Plating System and Baby Gorilla Plating System are cleared for use in stabilization and fixation of fractures or osteotomies; intra and extra articular fractures, joint depression, and multi-fragmentary fractures; revision procedures, joint fusion and reconstruction of small bones of the toes, feet and ankles including the distal tibia, talus, and calcaneus, as well as the fingers, hands, and wrists. The systems can be used in both adult and pediatric patients. We began developing the Gorilla Plating System and the Baby Gorilla Plating System in the fourth quarter of 2012 and received our initial 510(k) clearance in April 2014. The Gorilla Plating System and the Baby Gorilla Plating System are cleared as Class II medical devices for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
Our Silverback Ankle Fusion Plating System (Silverback) offers 62 unique, low profile, anterior, lateral, and posterior plate designs, five screw diameters, and a robust offering of joint preparation instrumentation to address tibiotalar (TT), tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC), or tibiocalcaneal (TC) arthrodesis.

The system can be used in both adult and pediatric patients. We began developing the Silverback Gorilla Plating System in the third quarter of 2017 and received our initial 510(k) clearance in September 2018. The Silverback Gorilla Plating System is cleared as a Class II medical device for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
Our Precision Guide Technology
Precision Guide is our patented instrument technology that we created with the goal to improve surgical outcomes and allow surgeons of all skill levels and experience to perform consistent and reproducible procedures utilizing our implants. This technology also saves time in the operating room and reduces the amount of fluoroscopy, a type of medical imaging, used.
Many foot and ankle procedures require cross-screws in addition to plates. For certain procedures, when a surgeon implants a cross-screw they can either insert the screw freehand or use our Precision Guide. Freehand screw placement may result in intra-operative hardware collision or multiple attempts to redirect the screws to avoid collision, which may result in unwanted revisions, longer surgical times, and slower patient recovery. 
Each Precision Guide variation is uniquely attuned to work in tandem with its corresponding procedurally focused plate or implant. Once plate screws are inserted, the surgeon attaches the Precision Guide to the plate with a simple hand screw. The Precision Guide arm provides the surgeon with a drill guide that is positioned at a pre-calculated, three-dimensional angle designed to avoid collision with the existing plate and plate screws and optimize orientation for ideal construct strength.
We have six variations of Precision Guide that are tailored to specific procedures where one or more cross-screws or implants are required. Our Precision Guide technology is available for the following procedures: MTP fusion (a procedure to address bunion deformities that fuses two bones on the big toe), first tarsometatarsal arthrodesis (Lapidus plate) and metatarsal osteotomy for bunion correction, medial column beaming for charcot foot reconstruction, ankle fusion plating, and naviculocuneiform (NC) joint arthrodesis.
Monster, Mini Monster, and Joust Beaming Screw Systems
To complement our plating systems and provide surgeons with the full suite of products, we created a variety of innovative standalone screw systems. Our screw systems are utilized in all major procedural segments within the foot and ankle industry. Every detail was scrutinized in the design of our screws, from thread distance and pitch to neck tapering angle (precompression taper), with the goal of providing differentiated screws that address the needs of patients and surgeons. To support our 510(k) submission, we conducted engineering analyses in which our screws were uniquely attuned and well-balanced for optimal strength and insertion sharpness, all while maintaining superior implantation represented by greater predicted pull-out strength compared with predicate devices.

Our Monster and Mini Monster Screw Systems are cannulated and solid screw systems with a wide variety of size and feature options. We offer a variety of length increments and multiple thread length options that allow versatility for the fixation of osteotomies, fractures, and joint arthrodesis. Our screw offerings are supported by a robust portfolio of tools and instruments designed to help improve consistency and accuracy of surgical outcomes.
Our Joust Beaming Screw System is comprised of cannulated and solid beams with a variety of sizes and features optimized to accommodate varying patient anatomy and allow surgeons greater flexibility in final placement. Compared to our Monster screw systems, Joust screws are longer in length and are primarily utilized in procedures that require stabilization that extends beyond one joint, such as charcot foot. Additionally, our Joust screws are constructed from Type II Anodized Titanium that have been proven in third-party clinical studies to provide improved fatigue strength, which may result in better patient outcomes.
Our screws can be used as a standalone implant, with other screws, or in tandem with a plating system, depending on the procedural demands and surgeon preference. We designed our screws with the mindset of being inclusive and cognizant of individual surgeon preferences, knowing that there is more than one way to a successful outcome. We believe that we offer surgeons one of the broadest array of screw options, including headed and headless screws, fully and partially threaded, all at various sizes. Other key features of our screws include reverse cutting flute threading, which are self-tapping reverse threads that help facilitate screw removal, and forward cutting flutes, which creates thread pattern during screw insertion and allow the screw to be self-tapping. 

The Monster Screw System is cleared for use in bone reconstruction, osteotomy, arthrodesis, joint fusion, ligament fixation, fracture repair and fracture fixation, appropriate for the size of the device. The Monster Screw System, including the Joust Beaming Screw System, can be used in both adult and pediatric patients. We began developing the Monster Screw System in the third quarter of 2011 and received our initial 510(k) clearance in April 2013. The Monster Screw System is cleared as Class II medical devices for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
The Joust Beaming Screw System is indicated for use in bone reconstruction, osteotomy, arthrodesis, joint fusion, ligament fixation, fracture repair and fracture fixation, appropriate for the size of the device. We began developing Joust Beaming Screw System in the fourth quarter of 2017 and received initial 510(k) clearance in April 2019. The Joust Beaming Screw System can be used in adult patients. The Joust Beaming Screw System is cleared as Class II medical device for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
APEX 3D Total Ankle Replacement System (TAR)
The APEX 3D is our total ankle replacement system that was initially cleared by the FDA in July 2020. We believe the APEX 3D System marks the next generation in total ankle arthroplasty, or replacement, with advanced technologies such as porous 3-D printed implants and Vitamin E infused highly cross-linked polyethylene. The APEX 3D implant is available in varying sizes and design configurations, including a universal polyethylene locking mechanism that provides surgeons versatility in implant sizing to best fit the needs of the patient. The APEX 3D System is based on over a century of combined clinical experience, cutting-edge biomechanical research, and is designed to address the inherent challenges associated with total ankle joint replacement clinical outcomes including tibial component loosening at a rate of between 12% and 38%, pathological wear, overly constrained articulation components in the presence of imperfect alignment, limited research to indicate the sensitivity of alignment, significant patient variation in gait, instability, and persistent pain. In addition, the APEX 3D System was designed to address the factors we believe contribute to loosening and stress of components. We believe it is the first true anatomic dual cone design, based on CT research around both diseased and healthy anatomy.  

The APEX 3D total ankle replacement system is cleared for use as a total ankle replacement in primary surgery for patients with ankle joints damaged by severe rheumatoid, post-traumatic or degenerative arthritis. Revision surgery for these patients is also indicated for patients with sufficient bone stock present. The APEX 3D total ankle replacement system can be used in both adult and pediatric patients. We began developing the APEX 3D total ankle replacement system in the fourth quarter of 2016 and received our initial 510(k) clearance in July 2020. The APEX 3D total ankle replacement system is cleared as Class II medical device for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
Smart 28 for Total Ankle Replacement
To complement our APEX 3D total ankle replacement implant and further distinguish our total ankle replacement procedure, we developed two advanced technologies, FasTrac and MAVEN, to utilize intra-operatively. Depending on physician preference and surgical needs, FasTrac or MAVEN is designed to ensure optimized implant positioning to enhance post-procedural surgical outcomes. FasTrac and MAVEN represent our first TAR-specific Smart 28 tools. We intend to further develop tools and capabilities across the entire continuum of TAR care to further enhance clinical outcomes for our APEX 3D patients.

FasTrac is our proprietary distal tibia alignment system that features laser technology developed to provide a precise visual reference point during component alignment, a critical step in establishing optimal implant placement during TAR. In addition to expediting and visually enhancing alignment, the system streamlines the surgical technique by eliminating the need to insert an additional pin into the tibia or conduct CT scans. The FasTrac system is designed to be used to verify varus/valgus alignment as well as internal external alignment. FasTrac is cleared for use for the same use as our APEX 3D total ankle replacement system and can be used in adult patient populations. We began developing FasTrac in the second quarter of 2018 and received initial 510(k) clearance in November 2020. FasTrac is cleared as Class II medical device for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
MAVEN is our proprietary patient-specific instrumentation offering that provides an accurate and simple-to-use surgical planning technology to surgeons. It utilizes an advanced CT-based coordinate system designed for reproducible alignment and accurate implant placement critical for long-term survivorship of the implant. MAVEN advances patient-specific technologies with its anatomical design features, which promote alignment accuracy, stability, and ideal implant placement. MAVEN is compatible with both weight-bearing CT and traditional CT scanning technologies and features one continuous scan from the knee through the base of the foot to capture biomechanically accurate data. The combination of patient-specific CT information, contoured guides, and APEX 3D implant designs provide the surgeon with exceptional technology engineered to optimize patient outcomes. Our MAVEN patient-specific instrumentation is intended to be used as patient specific surgical instrumentation to assist in the positioning of total ankle replacement components intraoperatively and in guiding the marking of bone before cutting. MAVEN can be used in both adult and pediatric patients. We began developing the MAVEN in the fourth quarter of 2018 and received initial 510(k) clearance in January 2021. MAVEN is cleared as Class II medical device for the above indication and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
 Patient Specific Total Talus Spacer
We have the first and only patient-specific total talus spacer authorized for marketing pursuant to an approved HDE application. The implant is designed to replace the talus, the bone in the ankle that connects the leg and foot. This distinct product offering allows patients to maintain a more active lifestyle and provides our surgeons access to a novel alternative to amputation or traditional ankle fusion therapies. We utilize our advanced technologies to create the patient-specific implant shape based on CT scan imaging data, bolstered with AI. The imaging data is then processed in our proprietary software applications to automatically create a design to match the patient’s specific anatomy. The design is then additively manufactured with laser sintering technology, a technique to harden the material, utilizing a cobalt chromium metal alloy.
Patients who received the Patient Specific Talus Spacer in an independent clinical study showed a reduction in pain compared to baseline visual analogue scale pain scores, a standard unidimensional measure of pain, improvement in range of motion, and improvement of functional outcomes based on all Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) subscales, including pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sports and recreational activities, and foot and ankle-related quality of life. This study evaluated 32 cases in 31 patients. The primary safety endpoint was the proportion of patients who underwent a secondary subsequent surgical intervention (SSSI). Other safety endpoints assessed included adverse events, device or procedure related adverse events, adverse events by severity, and serious adverse events. The probable benefit endpoint, which is an endpoint used in HDE applications to demonstrate the probable benefit of health from use of the device outweighs the risk of illness or injury from its use, was the reduction in baseline level pain following surgery using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. The secondary probable benefit endpoints assessed included ankle range of motion (ROM) and FAOS. FAOS subscales, pain, symptom (stiffness, swelling), activities of daily living (ADL), ability to perform sports and recreational activities (Sport/Rec); and foot/ankle-related quality of life (QoL) were also assessed. The patients who were implanted with the patient specific talus spacer in the above study received a clinically meaningful probable benefit from the device. The study demonstrated that baseline VAS pain score were reduced by -2.8 cm postoperatively, from 6.9 cm (moderate to severe pain) to 4.1 cm (mild pain). ROM also improved on average, especially when limiting the analysis to those patients who had at least year of follow-up and thus had adequate time to rehabilitate. Functional outcomes based on FAOS subscales also improved, with average improvement on all subscales exceeding the associated MIC threshold except Sport/Rec. Moreover, the rate of reoperation was low, with 9.4% of cases resulting in reoperation. Improvement in pain and function measures, accompanied by a low rate of reoperation, is particularly meaningful to AVN talus patients who have limited options and high risk of needing to undergo fusion or amputation. No serious adverse events were reported and there were only three adverse events reported, one for scarring and two for pain related to the implant. The study was not powered for significance.
The total talus spacer is marketed pursuant to an approved HDE application to treat avascular necrosis of the ankle joint. The anatomical landmarks necessary for the design and creation of the patient specific talus spacer must be present and identifiable on a CT scan. The total talus spacer system can only be used in adult patients. Additive Orthopeadics began development on the total talus spacer in the first quarter of 2016 and the original HDE application was approved in February 2021.
Forefoot or Hallux Valgus Correction Systems
We have developed a variety of products and systems to treat bunions. There is no one size fits all approach to such a complex confluence of soft tissue and bone deformities, and we developed a portfolio of surgical options to treat bunions of varying degrees of severity and other patient-specific considerations such as weight, age and level of desired activity. When choosing a bunion procedure, it is important to match the procedure to the severity and type of deformity, while considering factors such as medical co-morbidities, soft tissue, age, and activity level. Improper choice of procedure could lead to under correction, recurrence, complications or altered biomechanics of the foot. We believe that the goal of any bunion procedure should be to maximize deformity correction, while minimizing disruption of healthy tissue and bone. Our broad portfolio allows the surgeon to provide patients with a solution to address the appropriate level of intervention for their individual deformity, from mild and moderate to severe and end stage.
The below section highlights two of our various bunion correction systems, the PROMO Triplanar Hallux Valgus Correction System and the Phantom Intramedullary Nail System
More than 100 surgical techniques exist for the treatment of bunions. Bunion post-operative recurrence rates vary between different publications from 3% to 70%, representing significant variability and procedural limitations amongst conventional treatments. We designed our proximal rotational metatarsal osteotomy or PROMO Triplanar Hallux Valgus Correction System (PROMO) to consistently and effectively treat all three planar dimensions contributing to bunion deformity without requiring a fusion of the joint. We also developed our PROMO system to provide surgeons the flexibility to tailor the procedure to match the specific deformity and allow the opportunity to correct a wide range of bunion deformities. In addition, we have developed tools and instruments specific to the PROMO procedure, providing the surgeon with procedural reproducibility and accuracy. Additionally, in cases with healthy joints or with patients that are not hypermobile, our PROMO procedure does not require fusion of the TMT joint, or the tarsometatarsal joints in the foot, while still addressing all planes of deformity.
In a study published in Foot and Ankle Clinics in 2019, the authors report on their experience using the PROMO procedure on 60 patients with one year of follow-up and 25 patients with two years of follow-up. The authors noted that there was a 3% deformity recurrence rate observed, with 100% union rate achieved. In an earlier prospective study published in Foot & Ankle Orthopaedics in 2018, results demonstrated that the PROMO technique reliably corrects pronation and varus through a stable osteotomy, avoiding fusing of any healthy joints. After one year, all 25 patients were satisfied with the surgery, and no recurrence or complications were found. The authors also reported significant improvement in radiographic measurements, including the lack of metatarsal shortening, which can occur with the Lapidus bunionectomy procedure. We did not fund this study and were not involved in the data collection or the publication. The study was not powered for significance and the no adverse events were reported.  

The PROMO system is indicated for use for stabilization and fixation of fractures or osteotomies; intra and extra articular fractures, joint depression, and multi-fragmentary fractures; revision procedures, joint fusion and reconstruction of small bones of the toes, feet and ankles including the distal tibia, talus, and calcaneus, as well as the fingers, hands, and wrists. The PROMO system can be used in both adult and pediatric patients. We began developing the PROMO system in the second quarter of 2017 and received initial 510(k) clearance in December 2017. The PROMO system is cleared as Class II medical device for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
Phantom Intramedullary Nail System for Treatment of Severe Hallux Valgus
Our Hallux Valgus (bunions) portfolio also features our Phantom Intramedullary Nail system which is a novel dedicated intramedullary device designed specifically for correcting hallux valgus deformity by fusing the first TMT joint. Offered in a variety of lengths to accommodate variations in patient anatomy, the nail and threaded peg construct is positioned below the bone with zero profile to minimize soft tissue disruption during a Lapidus procedure. This design is intended to lessen pain associated with hardware prominence of traditional plating systems while minimizing disruption to the periosteum (blood supply). The system exerts a proportionate amount of force in all anatomic planes to resist recurrent hallux valgus and plantar gapping. The nail and threaded peg construct offer crossed screw fixation proximally and distally, providing for stability across the fusion site and allowing early weight bearing. Instrumentation provided in the system also allows the surgeon to dial in the appropriate amount of compression specific to each patient, with this compression being applied directly through the center of the anatomy, which is the ideal location.
Additionally, as part of this system, we offer unique instrumentation that provides targeting guides for precise placement and positioning of the nail and pegs.

In a clinical study designed to analyze the efficacy of different fixation devices in relation to such devices ability to prevent plantar gapping, our Phantom Intramedullary Nail demonstrated improved performance as compared to a medial wall plate construct and crossing screw constructs while avoiding soft tissue irritation. A study published in Foot & Ankle Orthopaedics in 2019 compared our 4-Hole Phantom Intramedullary Nail, 3-Hole Phantom Intramedullary Nail, Gorilla Lapidus Plate, and a two crossing screw construct in cadaveric tissue in cyclic loading, simulating repeated loading of the foot that would occur with walking. The study found that the 3-Hole and 4-Hole Phantom Intramedullary Nails, as well as the Gorilla Lapidus Plate all had statistically significant less plantar gap widening than crossing screws and may provide a better environment for bone healing than screw fixation. 
The Phantom Intramedullary Nail System is indicated for use in stabilization and fixation of the small bones of the feet and ankle for the treatment of fractures, osteotomies, nonunions, pseudoarthroses and malunions by revision, joint fusion or reconstruction procedures. Phantom Intramedullary Nail System can be used in both adult and pediatric patients. We began developing the Phantom Intramedullary Nail System in the fourth quarter of 2013 and received initial 510(k) clearance in June 2017. The Phantom Intramedullary Nail System is cleared as Class II medical device for the above indications and the associated instrumentation are cleared as Class I medical devices.
Orthobiologics
We offer a variety of different orthobiologics, including bone wedges, grafts, demineralized bone matrices, bone void fillers, synthetic materials, amniotic products, and a biocompatible collagen matrix. Our flagship orthobiologic product is our patented PRESERVE Bone Graft System, which features eight procedure-specific shapes with more than 40 size variations, significantly reducing the need for potential graft shaping. PRESERVE is complemented with a variety of sizer instruments that allow surgeons the ability to determine ideal graft size and position to achieve the desired correction.
Our PRESERVE allografts are made of dense cancellous bone, which is the spongy portion typically found at the end of the bone. Studies have shown that cancellous bone is eight times more metabolically active than cortical bone, which is the dense outer surface of the bone, and has a higher union rate. Additionally, to enhance the quality and performance of our grafts we apply an aseptic processing technique that helps preserve the biomechanical properties of the bone and this narrows the donor pool to only the highest quality bone. Our process does not utilize traditional terminal sterilization techniques such as gamma irradiation or hydrogen peroxide. Studies have shown that terminal sterilization techniques may make bones more brittle, negatively impact osteoinductivity of bone, and delay graft incorporation or even contribute to graft non-union. Because our process allows us to maintain mechanical integrity of the graft, we don’t have to utilize a cortical rim which in turn gives us greater visibility of graft incorporation post-implantation and increases incorporation speed. We believe that our unique and patented shapes and processing techniques allow PRESERVE to be a superior product and improve clinical outcomes for our patients.
In a study published in Foot & Ankle Orthopaedics in 2016, the authors determine if using gamma irradiation during processing will significantly decrease the modulus (elasticity), maximum compression strain and stress and energy during static testing of dense cancellous bone. The purpose was to also determine if using gamma irradiation during processing would significantly decrease the strain energy of the allograft during dynamic testing in dense cancellous bone. Static testing results demonstrated a 27% reduction in modulus, a 26% reduction in maximum stress, a 15% reduction in strain at maximum stress and a 37% reduction in energy in the gamma irradiated specimens versus aseptically processed specimens. 

The PRESERVE Bone Graft System is regulated as a Human Cell and Tissue Product (HCT/P) under Section 361 of the Public Health and Services Act (PHSA). The PRESERVE Bone Graft System is intended for homologous use only, which means repair, reconstruction, replacement, or supplementation of a recipient’s cells or tissues with tissue-based product that performs the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor. We began developing the PRESERVE Bone Graft System in the first quarter of 2013.

To support our commercial expansion and awareness of the clinical benefits of our solutions, we have made significant investments in our education and training programs. To date, we have trained thousands of surgeons and other professionals. In addition, in 2019 we opened a new corporate, research and development, and clinical headquarters, which includes a 250-person auditorium and a 40-station cadaveric lab that have the capacity to train up to 5,000 people per year. In the United States, we believe there are approximately 2,400 orthopedic surgeons who specialize in foot and ankle, approximately 2,300 pediatric and trauma surgeons that treat foot and ankle and approximately 9,000 surgical podiatrists, approximately half of which are performing foot and ankle surgery. In addition to education and training opportunities offered at our headquarters, we employ a broad range of additional options including regional programs and virtual seminars. The breadth of our educational and training programs allows us to cater to a broad range of surgeons and sales people with significant flexibility around time and location.
Education for our commercial organization is extensive and on-going. We believe our extensive training programs have contributed to the clinical expertise of our sales representatives, enabling them to become trusted partners of foot and ankle surgeons.
Our U.S. sales forces consists primarily of independent sales representatives, the majority of whom are exclusive. For the year ended December 31, 2022, substantially all of our U.S. revenue was produced by 234 producing sales representatives. We define producing sales representatives as those sales representatives logging revenue, for at least one case, in all three months of each quarter. As of December 31, 2022, our international sales force consists of 13 non-stocking distributors, 8 stocking distributors, and 1 direct market. We began selling outside the U.S. in 2016. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to capture market share in existing and new territories both in the United States and internationally. We expect to continue to dedicate meaningful resources to expand and strengthen our global sales force.
Competition
The foot and ankle market is a young and relatively new surgical specialty that is dominated by a handful of incumbents that operate across the broader medical device and orthopedic markets. Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to competition. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
•product features and design; 
 •technological advancements using data driven tools across foot and ankle continuum of care; 
 •physician training and education; 
 •product quality and standards including our reputation with our customers; 
 •patient experience; 
 •product price including level of coverage and reimbursement; 
 •clinical outcomes and ease of use; 
 •intellectual property; and 
 •customer service. 
 Within the lower extremities market, our primary competitors include multinational companies such as Stryker Corporation (Stryker), Arthrex, Inc. (Arthrex), Smith & Nephew plc (Smith and Nephew), Johnson and Johnson (J&J) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer Biomet) as well as with companies with one or a limited number of foot and ankle products such as Enovis Medical (Enovis), CrossRoads Extremity Systems, LLC (Crossroads), Medline Industries, Inc. (Medline), Conmed Corporation (Conmed), Novastep Inc. (Novastep) and Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (Treace).
Many of our multinational competitors have significant financial resources and in addition to competing for foot and ankle market share, they also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing professionals, qualified research & development expertise, speed and cadence of product launches and acquiring novel technologies that augment their existing portfolios.
Due to our growing international presence, we also compete with medical device manufacturers outside of the United States. These competitors may develop effective or less expensive products and obtain regulatory clearance or certification before us.

Intellectual Property
We actively seek to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to our business using patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights in the United States and foreign markets.
As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio included 262 owned and issued patents. Of our patents:
•Nineteen patents relate to technologies used in our orthobiologics products, all of which are design patents and relate to the associated tools and implants used; nine are U.S. patents, five are UK patents and five are EU patents; and these patents begin to expire in 2028.
•Thirteen patents relate to technologies used in our nails; of these five are design patents and eight are utility patents; one relates to surgical techniques and seven relate to the associated tools and/or implants used; six are U.S. patents, two are European patents, two are UK patents, one is a Swiss patent, one is a German patent, and one is a Japanese patent; and these patents begin to expire 2030.
 •One hundred and sixty four patents relate to technologies used in our plating systems; of these 116 are design patents and 48 are utility patents; all of these patents relate to the associated tools with one also covering the surgical technique; 71 are U.S. patents, 37 are EU patents, 40 are UK patents, four are German patents, four are French patents, three are Spanish patents, three are Dutch patents and one is an Australian patent; and these patents begin to expire in 2028.

 •Nine patents relate to technologies used in our total ankle arthroplasty system; all of these are U.S. utility patents that cover the implant system and the tools used; and these patents begin to expire in 2029.
 In addition to our owned patents, we have nine registered patents that are in-licensed pursuant to our agreement with Biedermann Technologies GmbH & Co. KG ("Biedermann") and two registered patents that are in-licensed pursuant to our agreement with Extremity Medical, LLC (“Extremity”).Of the nine patents licensed from Biedermann, six are utility patents and three are design patents. All of the Biedermann patents relate to technologies used in our JAWs staple system. Of the patents licensed from Biedermann, six are U.S. patents, one is a EU patent, one is a Chinese patent and one is a Japanese patent. The patents licensed from Biedermann begin to expire in 2033. The two patents licensed from Extremity are utility patents and relate to technology used in our Phantom Lapidus Intramedullary Nail System. The patents licensed from Extremity begin to expire in 2030.
 We entered into the license agreement with Biedermann in July 2017 ("Biedermann License Agreement"). Pursuant to the Biedermann License Agreement, we are required to pay a royalty of four percent (4%) of net revenue related to the licensed intellectual property for the 15 years following the date of first sale, including a minimum annual payment of $250,000. The term of the agreement is 20 years, and automatically renews for five-year periods thereafter. Payments to Biedermann under this license agreement totaled $249,000, $87,000 and $111,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amounts payable to Biedermann as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $164,000 and $163,000, respectively. We entered into the Extremity License Agreement in November of 2021 (“Extremity license Agreement”). Pursuant to the Extremity License Agreement. we are required to pay a royalty of four percent (4%) of net sales related to the licensed intellectual property until the expiration of the last expired patent. Payments to Extremity under this license agreement totaled $64,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe the Biedermann License Agreements and the Extremity License Agreement are both immaterial to our business.

As of December 31, 2022 we had 231 pending patent applications globally, including 74 in the United States. In addition to these patent applications, we had four pending patent applications that are pursuant to our license agreement with Biedermann. All of the patent applications pursuant to our license agreement with Biedermann are utility patents and they cover technology related to our JAWS staple system. Of these patent applications, two are U.S. patents and two are EU patents. These patent applications will expire 20 years from their earliest filing date when issued. As a result, the earliest these patents could expire, if issued, would be 2035. The pending patent applications are intended to exclude competitors from practicing the innovations of our currently marketed product offering and to protect potential future commercialization opportunities and to strategically block potential workarounds by competitors.
We have U.S. trademark registrations for several of our most material marks, including “PARAGON 28,” “MONSTER,” “GORILLA” and “PHANTOM.” We also have pending U.S. trademark registrations on other material marks, including “APEX 3D,” “MAVEN,” “SILVERBACK,” and “R3ACT.”
The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In many countries, including the United States, the patent term for a utility patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. We cannot assure that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop competitive treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents, and we may be unable to stop such competitor from commercializing such treatment methods or devices. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe.
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation of the alleged rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the alleged proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could result in significant expense and could divert our attention and resources from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages and/or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market.
Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay significant royalties to such third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our product or techniques, any of which could severely harm our business.
Our knowledge and experience, creative product development, marketing staff and trade secret information, with respect to manufacturing processes, materials and product design, are as important as our patents in maintaining our proprietary product lines. As a condition of employment, we require all employees and key contractors to execute an agreement obligating them to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and assign to us inventions and other intellectual property created during their employment. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Manufacturing and Supply
We currently leverage multiple third-party manufacturing relationships to ensure high quality, low cost production while maintaining a capital efficient business model. We have multiple sources of supply for many of our surgical solutions’ critical components. Nearly all of our supply agreements do not have minimum manufacturing or purchase obligations. As such, we generally do not have any obligation to buy any given quantity of products, and our suppliers generally have no obligation to sell to us or to manufacture for us any given quantity of our products or components for our products. In most cases, we have redundant manufacturing capabilities for each of our products although we are starting to experience some inflationary pressure and extended lead times, primarily limited to raw materials and labor. Except during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not experienced any significant difficulty obtaining our products or components for our products necessary to meet demand, and we have only experienced limited instances where our suppliers had difficulty supplying products by the requested delivery date. We believe manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet market demand for our products for the foreseeable future.
 Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from both historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components, sub-assemblies and materials. For a discussion of risks related to third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers, some of which are single source, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Administrative, Organizational and Commercial Operations and Growth— We depend on third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers, some of which are single source, to produce and package all elements comprising our foot and ankle products, and if these suppliers and manufacturers fail to supply us, our products or their components or subcomponents in sufficient quantities or at all, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations."
Government Regulation
Our products, product candidates and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) as implemented and enforced by the FDA, and to similar regulations as implemented and enforced by applicable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions.
United States Regulation
The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, de novo classification, or approval of a PMA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents.
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. The majority of our currently marketed products are Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance, though we also market certain Class I exempt devices that do not require 510(k) clearance and one Class III product that is marketed pursuant to an approved HDE

application. We are also in the process of developing one of our pipeline products that we believe will be subject to the requirement for approval under a PMA before it can be marketed.
510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed before May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2023, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification application is $19,870.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) premarket notification, request for de novo classification or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance, approval of a PMA, or issuance of a de novo classification. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Over the last several years, the FDA has reformed its 510(k) clearance process. For example, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as recommended testing methods where feasible.
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA applications are also subject to the payment of user fees, which for fiscal year 2023 includes a standard application fee of $441,547.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitutes valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients

in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. None of our products are currently marketed pursuant to a PMA.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination.
Humanitarian Device Exemption Pathway
A HDE is a marketing pathway available to devices designated as humanitarian use devices, or HUDs. HUDs are devices receiving a designation from the FDA that the device is designed to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that occurs in fewer than 8,000 people in the U.S. per year. To market a HUD, the device must have received a HUD designation by the FDA and be approved by the FDA pursuant to an HDE application. An HDE approval is based on the applicant’s demonstration that there is no comparable device available and that the probable benefit to health from the proposed HUD outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use, taking into account alternative treatments that are available for the condition or disease. However, a medical device approved pursuant to an HDE is exempt from the effectiveness requirements that would otherwise apply and to which the device would be subject if approved pursuant to a PMA, and clinical studies demonstrating effectiveness are not required to support approval. An approved HDE must be labeled with a disclaimer stating that the effectiveness of the device has not been established.
In addition, HUDs that receive HDE approval may not be sold for profit except in limited circumstances, such as where the disease or condition the HUD is intended to treat occurs in pediatric patients or subpopulations and the device is labeled for this use. Where the disease or condition occurs in adults and does not occur in the pediatric population (or occurs in the pediatric population in such numbers that development of the device for such population is impossible, highly impracticable, or unsafe), the device may also be sold for profit. However, in either case, to sell the device for profit, HDE holders must notify the FDA of the intent to sell for profit and are limited in the number of devices that may be sold for profit on an annual basis.
Prior to HUD use following HDE approval, the HDE holder is required to ensure that use of the use of the HUD has been approved by the facility’s IRB. Post-approval clinical studies may also be required. Our total talus spacer was authorized for marketing pursuant to an approved HDE with the requirement for a post-approval study.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA, HDE application, or de novo classification request and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must

be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective before commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
U.S. Regulation of HCT/Ps
Certain of our products are regulated as HCT/Ps. Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “Section 361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, and Good Tissue Practices (cGTPs) when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting. Specifically, cGTPs are requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps in a way that prevents the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases. Section 361 HCT/Ps do not require approval of a marketing application from the FDA before marketing. However, to be regulated as a Section 361 HCT/P, the product must, among other things, be “minimally manipulated,” which for structural tissue products means that the manufacturing processes do not alter the original relevant characteristics of the tissue relating to the tissue’s utility for reconstruction, repair, or replacement and for cells or nonstructural tissue products, means that the manufacturing processes do not alter the relevant biological characteristics of cells or tissues. A Section 361 HCT/P must also be intended for “homologous use,” which refers to use in the repair, reconstruction, replacement, or supplementation of a recipient’s cells or tissues with an HCT/P that performs the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor. HCT/Ps that do not meet the criteria of Section 361 are regulated under Section 351 of the PHSA. Unlike Section 361 HCT/Ps, HCT/Ps regulated as “Section 351” HCT/Ps are subject to the requirement for premarket review and marketing authorization by the FDA.
In November 2017, the FDA released a guidance document entitled “Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue—Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use—Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” The guidance outlined the FDA’s position that all products being purportedly marketed as Section 361 HCT/Ps are more than minimally manipulated and would therefore require a marketing approval to be lawfully marketed in the United States. The guidance also indicated that the FDA would exercise enforcement discretion, using a risk-based approach, with respect to the IND

application and pre-market approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps for a period of 36 months from the issuance date of the guidance to allow manufacturers to pursue INDs and/or seek marketing authorizations. Under this approach, FDA indicated that high-risk products and uses could be subject to immediate enforcement action. In July 2020, the FDA extended its period of enforcement discretion to May 31, 2021. As of June 1, 2021, the FDA resumed enforcement of IND and premarket approval requirements with respect to these products.
Pervasive and Continuing Post-Market Regulation
After a product is cleared or approved for marketing (or where the product does not require affirmative marketing authorization, is marketed), numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
 •QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers and suppliers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products; 
 •requirements related to promotional activities; 
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices or devices authorized for marketing pursuant to the HDE pathway; 
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
 •the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
 •post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
 Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
 •operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; 


•withdrawing 510(k) clearances, HDEs, or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
 •refusal to grant export approvals for our products; 
 •civil monetary penalties; or 
 •injunctions or criminal prosecution. 
 Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
The European Union (EU) has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.
Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (EU Medical Devices Directive) which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (EU Medical Devices Regulation). Our current certificates have been granted and renewed under the EU Medical Devices Directive whose regime is described below. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire.
EU Medical Devices Directive
Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturer's quality system (notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
EU Medical Devices Regulation
The regulatory landscape concerning medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On April 5, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted to establish a modernized and more robust EU legislative framework, with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a

uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021.
Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid and no substantial change must be made to the device in question. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular the obligations described below.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to Eudamed, unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (UDI), database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (UDI-DI) specific to a device, and a production identifier (UDI-PI) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.
All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs, which are defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. A serious incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device on the market (e.g. inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer, undesirable side-effect), which, directly or indirectly, might lead to either the death or serious deterioration of the healthof a patient, user, or other persons or to a serious public health threat. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.
The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Additional requirements applicable to products containing human cells and tissues
 The EU does not have an overarching law or regulation that governs the legal framework surrounding products containing human tissues or cells in a way that would be analogous to HCT/Ps in the U.S. However, specific requirements apply with respect to human cells and tissues, in particular, when used in a product such as a medical device. Under EU law, the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells intended for human application, and of

manufactured products which are derived from such cells and tissues, are currently governed by Directive 2004/23/EC (the EU Tissues and Cells Directive).
To the extent the manufactured product is covered by another EU regulation or directive, only the requirements relating to donation, procurement and testing under the EU Tissues and Cells Directive apply in addition to the requirements set out under the relevant EU regulation or directive applicable to the product in question.
With respect to medical devices, as a general principle, the EU Medical Devices Regulation does not apply to tissues or cells, or their derivatives (i.e., non-cellular substances extracted from such tissue or cells through a manufacturing process, which do not contain any cells or tissue at the final substance stage), or products containing or consisting of such human materials.
However, the EU Medical Devices Regulation does apply to devices that are manufactured using derivatives of human tissues or cells, to the extent such human materials are non-viable or rendered so. In such a case, applicable requirements depend on the action of the device part and that of the human materials it contains. If the device incorporates, as an integral part, non-viable human cells and tissues or their derivatives and their action is ancillary to that of the device, (i) relevant provisions of the EU Tissues and Cells Directive on donation, procurement and testing apply with respect to the human tissues and cells incorporated in the device, and (ii) applicable requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation apply with respect to the assessment and certification of the device. If, however, the action of the human tissues or cells (or derivatives thereof) is not ancillary to that of the device, the device is governed by the EU Tissues and Cells Directive only, and the general safety and performance requirements set out under the EU Medical Devices Regulation only apply to the extent the safety and performance of the device part of the product are concerned.
The EU Tissues and Cells Directive provides for general quality and safety requirements with respect to activities performed in relation to human cells and tissues. Since, for such activities, EU directives are not being of direct application, these requirements are implemented under national law, in each EU member state, and as such applicable requirements may vary from one EU member state to another, as each is free to implement measures which are more stringent than those set out under the EU Tissues and Cells Directive. Among other things, the EU Tissues and Cells Directive requires the following:
 •tissue and cell procurement and testing must be conducted by persons appropriately trained and experienced; 
 •tissue and cell establishments must (i) be accredited, designated, authorized or licensed by the national competent authority, (ii) perform appropriate controls to ensure compliance with applicable requirements, (iii) maintain records of their activities, and (iv) implement a quality system based on good practices principles set out by the European Commission – similar to cGTPs in the U.S.; 
 •a traceability system must be implemented such that the tissues and cells can be traced from the donor to the recipient, which includes appropriate labeling of said tissues and cells;
 •import and export of human tissues and cells must be undertaken by establishments which are duly accredited, designated, authorized or licensed by the national competent authority, and these tissues and cells must comply with the requirements set out under the EU Tissues and Cells Directive; and
 •a system for the notification of serious adverse events and reactions must be implemented. 
 On July 14, 2022, the European Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on substances of human origin (SoHO) (the SoHO Proposal). Unlike directives, in all EU member states, regulations are directly applicable without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them, in all EU member states. The SoHO Proposal aims to repeal, replace, and aggregate the existing regulatory framework applicable to human blood, tissue and cells, consisting of Directive 2002/98/EC on blood and blood components and the EU Tissue and Cells Directive. It will come into force onceOnce a final text is adopted, the SoHO Proposal will come into force, although there will be a 2-year transition period before most provisions apply and a 3-year period before certain provisions apply. The extent to which the requirements of the SoHO Proposal will apply to medical devices vary. Where SoHO are used to manufacture medical devices, the provisions applicable to the activities of SoHO donor recruitment, donor history review and eligibility assessment, testing of donors for eligibility or matching purposes, and collection of SoHO from donors or patients will generally apply. However, where non-viable SoHO or their derivatives incorporate, as an integral part, a medical device, and where the action of the non-viable SoHO or their derivatives is principal and not ancillary to that of the device, the non-viable SoHO or their derivatives will be governed by the SoHO Proposal (in line with applicable provisions of the EU Medical Devices Regulation). The SoHO Proposal also seeks to improve consultation and cooperation between competent authorities regulating the different frameworks to ensure coherent oversight.
In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations

and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Brexit
Since the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1, 2021, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) has not been directly subject to EU laws, however under the terms of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, EU laws generally apply to Northern Ireland. The EU laws that have been transposed into United Kingdom (UK) law through secondary legislation remain applicable in Great Britain. However, under the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022, which is currently before the UK parliament, any retained EU law not expressly preserved and “assimilated” into domestic law or extended by ministerial regulations (to no later than June 23, 2026) will automatically expire and be revoked by December 31, 2023. In addition, new legislation such as the EU Medical Devices Regulation is not applicable in Great Britain.
 The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
 The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), came into effect on January 1, 2021. The TCA does not specifically refer to medical devices but does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions). For medical devices that are locally manufactured but use components from other countries, the “rules of origin” criteria will need to be reviewed. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in Great Britain.
Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain. New regulations require all medical devices to be registered with the MHRA, and since January 1, 2022, manufacturers based outside the UK have been required to appoint a UK responsible person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA.
 On June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its response to a 10-week consultation on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. The MHRA seeks to amend the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (the UK MDR) (which continues to be based on the EU legislation which preceded the EU Medical Devices Regulation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive, i.e., Directive 98/79/EC), in particular to create a new access pathway to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic medical device regulation and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. Regulations implementing the new regime were originally scheduled to come into force in July 2023, but the Government has recently confirmed that this date has been postponed until July 2024. Devices which have valid certification issued by EU notified bodies under the EU Medical Devices Regulation or Medical Devices Directive are subject to transitional arrangements. In its consultation response, the MHRA indicated that the future UK regulations will allow devices certified under the EU Medical Devices Regulation to be placed on the market in Great Britain under the CE mark until either the certificate expires or for five years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Devices certified under the Medical Devices Directive could continue to be placed on the market until either the certificate expires or for three years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Following these transitional periods, it is expected that all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessment (UKCA) mark. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis prior to the regulations coming into force. However, from July 2024, products which do not have existing and valid CE certification under the EU Medical Devices Directive or EU Medical Devices Regulation and are therefore not subject to the transitional arrangements will be required to carry the UKCA mark if they are to be sold into the market in Great Britain. UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and continues to be based on EU law.
Under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland follows EU rules on medical devices and devices marketed in Northern Ireland require assessment according to the EU regulatory regime. Such assessment may be conducted by an EU notified body, in which case a CE mark is required before placing the device on the market in the EU or Northern Ireland. Alternatively, if a

UK notified body conducts such assessment, a ‘UKNI’ mark applied and the device may only be placed on the market in Northern Ireland and not the EU.
 UK requirements applicable to products containing human cells and tissues
The UK MDR does not generally apply to tissues or cells of human origin or products incorporating or derived from tissues or cells of human origin. Products will be required to comply with the UK MDR if they are manufactured utilizing animal tissue which is rendered non-viable or non-viable products derived from animal tissue. The UK MDR states that with respect to devices manufactured utilizing tissues of animal origin, the relevant approved body must follow the procedures referred to in Commission Regulation 722/2012, which forms part of EU retained law. In particular, the manufacturer of the medical device must be able to verify that the device’s benefits outweigh the risks, taking into account:
 •the risk analysis and risk management process; 
 •the justification for the use of animal tissues or derivatives, taking into consideration lower risk tissues or synthetic alternatives; 
 •the results of elimination and inactivation studies or results of the analysis of relevant literature; 
 •the manufacturer’s control of the sources of raw materials, finished products, production process, testing, and subcontractors; and 
 •the need to audit matters related to the sourcing and processing of animal tissues and derivatives, processes to eliminate or inactivate pathogens, including those activities carried out by suppliers.
 The Human Tissue Act 2004 regulates the removal, storage and use of human tissue in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and is based on the principle that consent is required for a set of “scheduled purposes”, which include transplantation, anatomical examination and research in connection with disorders or functioning of the human body. “Human tissue” is defined as material that has come from a human body and consists of, or includes, human cells. Separate legislation, the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006, applies in Scotland.
The Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) Regulations 2007 (as amended) implements the requirements of the EU Tissues and Cells Directive, and sets out the activities of storing and importing human tissues and cells for human application can only be carried out by an establishment holding an appropriate license, issued from the Human Tissue Authority (the HTA). The following activities may be carried out either under an appropriate HTA license: procurement, testing, processing, export, and distribution. Alternatively, the listed activities can be carried out under the authority of a third party agreement in the following circumstances:
 •when the establishment carrying out the activity is acting on behalf of an appropriately licensed establishment; and
 •when the third party agreement meets the standards set out in the Guide to Quality and Safety Assurance of Human Tissues and Cells for Patient Treatment, as implemented by HTA Directions 001/2021.
 The Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) Regulations 2007 (as amended) sets out further conditions on licensed establishments, such as requirements to have a “designated individual” who plays an important role in ensuring compliance and a requirement to report serious adverse events (SAEs) or serious adverse reactions (SARs) to the HTA within 24 hours of discovery.
 Establishments which export tissues and cells must demonstrate that exported tissue or cells meet the quality and safety standards as set out in the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) Regulations, 2007 (as amended). Further, establishments which import tissues and cells must demonstrate that imported tissue or cells meet “equivalent” quality and safety standards to those set out in the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human Application) Regulations, 2007 (as amended). Since July 1, 2021, establishments based in Great Britain which either import or export human tissues or cells for human application between Great Britain and a country in the EEA, have been required to obtain a license from the HTA. Licensing requirements to send tissues and cells from Great Britain to recipients in Northern Ireland have not changed post-Brexit.

Data Privacy & Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States, our currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in orthopedic surgery and if covered by third-party payors, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Outside of the United States, there are many reimbursement programs through private payors as well as government programs. In some countries, government reimbursement is the predominant program available to patients and hospitals. Our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Based on our experience to date, third-party payors generally reimburse for the surgical procedures in which our products are used only if the patient meets the established medical necessity criteria for surgery. Some payors are moving toward a managed care system and control their health care costs by limiting authorizations for surgical procedures, including elective procedures using our devices. Although no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States exists and coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor, reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors may depend upon a number of factors, including the payor’s determination that use of a product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication; 
 •cost effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly auditing and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services with concern for upcoding, miscoding, using inappropriate modifiers, or billing for inappropriate care settings. Some third-party payors must approve coverage for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse health care providers who use the products or therapies. Even though a new product may have been cleared for commercial distribution by the FDA or certified in foreign jurisdictions, we may find limited demand for the product unless and until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payors.
A key component in ensuring whether the appropriate payment amount is received for physician and other services, including those procedures using our products, is the existence of a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code to describe the procedure in which the product is used. To receive payment, health care practitioners must submit claims to insurers using these codes for payment for medical services. CPT codes are assigned, maintained and annually updated by the American Medical Association and its CPT Editorial Board. If the CPT codes that apply to the procedures performed using our products are changed or deleted, reimbursement for performances of these procedures may be adversely affected.
In the United States, some insured individuals enroll in managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita (patient) basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use our products.

We believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the health care and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services. All third-party reimbursement programs are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring second opinions before major surgery, careful review of bills, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and other preventative services and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care.
In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes routine updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. These updates could directly impact the demand for our products.
Health Care Reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform health care or reduce health care costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
In the United States, the implementation of the ACA for example, has changed health care financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the ACA expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health care, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations.
We expect additional state and federal health care reform measures to be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, some of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. Similar reform measures may be adopted in foreign jurisdictions. For instance, in December 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted in the EU. While the Regulation entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from January 2025 onwards, with preparatory and implementation-related steps to take place in the interim. Once the Regulation becomes applicable, it will have a phased implementation depending on the concerned products. This regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and providing the

basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The regulation will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.
 Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA and foreign restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal, state, and foreign laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to health care providers.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit.
In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program.
HIPAA also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to health care professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In the EU, many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and

transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to health care professionals and entities.
Penalties for violation of any of the health care laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us include, without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of an entity’s operations.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 463 full-time employees. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
Facilities
In January 2022, we purchased our Headquarters located at 14445 Grasslands Drive, Englewood, CO. Prior to the closing related to the purchase, we had leased the building from AMBAR Grasslands LLC. We believe that this facility is sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs in the near term and that additional space can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms as needed.
