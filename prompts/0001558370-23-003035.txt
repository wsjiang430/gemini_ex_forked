Item 1. Business
​
Overview
We are a biotechnology company dedicated to discovering, developing and providing novel therapies that significantly improve the lives of patients with hematologic disorders and cancer. Our pioneering research focuses on signaling pathways that are critical to disease mechanisms. 
Our first product approved by the FDA is TAVALISSE (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets, the only approved oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. The product is also commercially available in Europe and the United Kingdom (UK) (as TAVLESSE), and in Canada and Israel (as TAVALISSE) for the treatment of chronic ITP in adult patients. 
Our second FDA approved product is REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) capsules for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. We began our commercialization of REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) in December 2022. We in-licensed olutasidenib from Forma Therapeutics, Inc. (Forma), with exclusive, worldwide rights for its development, manufacturing and commercialization 
We conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating fostamatinib for the treatment of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) and announced that we did not file a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for this indication considering the top-line data results and guidance received from the FDA. We announced the completion of the FOCUS Phase 3 clinical trial of fostamatinib for the treatment of hospitalized high-risk patients with COVID-19. Fostamatinib is currently being studied in a National Institute of Health (NIH)/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) sponsored Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Inventions and Vaccines Phase 2/3 trial (ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial) for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. 
Our other clinical programs include our interleukin receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) inhibitor program, and a receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK1) inhibitor program in clinical development with partner Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). In addition, we have product candidates in clinical development with partners BerGenBio ASA (BerGenBio) and Daiichi Sankyo (Daiichi). 
Business Updates
​
TAVALISSE in ITP
In 2022, our net product sales of TAVALISSE were $75.8 million, a 20% increase compared to 2021. The increase in our net product sales was primarily driven by the increase in quantities sold as well as the increase in price per bottle of TAVALISSE. These increases were partially offset by the increase in revenue reserves mainly due to higher rebates on recent contracts entered with certain Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs), and higher government program rebates. Our first quarter net sales are typically impacted by the first quarter reimbursement issues such as the resetting of co-pays and the Medicare donut hole.
We continue to deploy resources to enable our field-based employees to engage with health care providers, either in-person or virtually. These engagements have enabled our field team to cover existing prescribers, as well as develop relationships with new prescribers to appropriately market TAVALISSE. In the third quarter of 2021, we expanded our sales force by increasing our number of territories. 

REZLIDHIA in R/R AML with mIDHI
​
On December 1, 2022, the FDA approved REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) capsules for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. The recommended dosage of REZLIDHIA is 150 mg taken orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. We in-licensed olutasidenib from Forma with exclusive, worldwide rights for its development, manufacturing and

commercialization. On December 22, 2022, we began the commercialization of REZLIDHIA in the US and made it available to patients. In 2022, we recorded net product sales of $0.9 million from sale of REZLIDHIA. REZLIDHIA is highly synergistic with our existing hematology-oncology focused commercial and medical affairs infrastructure. We incurred operating expenses in 2022 and will continue to incur such expenses in the future associated with our commercial launch activities for REZLIDHIA in the US. Specifically, our commercial efforts focus on targeting hematologists and hematologist-oncologists who manage patients with R/R AML. We also plan to enter partnerships with third parties to commercialize REZLIDHIA outside the US. For further discussions and other updates on REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib), refer to “Commercial Products – REZLIDHIA in R/R AML with mIDH1” section below. 
​
Pursuant to the license and transition services agreement with Forma entered on July 27, 2022, Forma provided us an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize olutasidenib, Forma’s proprietary inhibitor of mutated IDH1 (mIDH1), for any uses worldwide, including for the treatment of AML and other malignancies. On October 14, 2022, Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo Nordisk) announced the completion of the acquisition of Forma. Following this acquisition, Forma became a wholly owned subsidiary of Novo Nordisk.
​
In accordance with the terms of the license and transition services agreement, we paid Forma an upfront fee of $2.0 million, with the potential to pay up to $67.5 million additional payments upon achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $165.5 million additional payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the license and transition services agreement, Forma would be entitled to tiered royalty payments on net sales of licensed products at percentages ranging from low-teens to mid-thirties, as well as certain portions of our sublicensing revenue, subject to certain standard reductions and offsets. As of December 31, 2022, certain milestones were met which entitled Forma to receive a $17.5 million milestone payment, of which, $15.0 million was outstanding and included within accounts payable on our balance sheet. For further discussions of the license and transition services agreement with Forma, see “Note 4 - Sponsored Research and License Agreements and Government Contract” to our “Notes to Financial Statements” contained in “Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
R289, an Oral IRAK1/4 Inhibitor for Autoimmune, Inflammatory and Hematology-Oncology Diseases
​
We continue to advance the development of our IRAK1/4 program, completing the evaluation of a new pro-drug formulation of R835, R289, in single-ascending and multiple ascending dose studies with positive safety results in 2021. In January 2022, we received clearance from the FDA on our clinical trial design to explore R289 in low-risk MDS. The open-label, Phase 1b trial will determine the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of R289 in patients with low-risk MDS who are refractory or resistant to prior therapies. In December 2022, we announced that we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1b trial of R289. The Phase 1b trial of R289 is expected to enroll approximately 22 patients. The primary objective of the trial is safety, with secondary and exploratory objectives to assess preliminary efficacy and characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of R289. The safety and efficacy data from this Phase 1b trial, along with the safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data from the completed first-in-human study in heathy volunteers, are intended to be used to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose for future clinical development of R289 targeting lower-risk MDS. 
Fostamatinib in Hospitalized COVID-19 patients
In April 2021, we reported positive top-line results from a multi-center, Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by the NIH/NHLBI, evaluating the safety of fostamatinib, our oral SYK inhibitor, for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The trial met its primary endpoint of safety comparable to standard of care (SoC) and showed broad and consistent improvement in numerous efficacy endpoints, including mortality, ordinal scale assessment, and number of days in the intensive care unit (ICU). In May 2021, the trial data were submitted as part of a request for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA for fostamatinib as a treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In August 2021, the FDA informed us that the clinical data submitted from the NIH/NHLBI-sponsored Phase 2 trial were insufficient to support an EUA. In September 2021, the data from the NIH/NHLBI-sponsored Phase 2 trial was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, an official publication of the Infectious Disease Society of America.

In July 2022, we completed the enrollment of our FOCUS Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without respiratory failure that have certain high-risk prognostic factors with 280 patients. The trial had originally targeted a total of 308 patients; however, we determined the trial would be sufficiently powered with 280 patients to potentially provide a clinically meaningful result and determine the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. On November 1, 2022, we announced the top-line results from the FOCUS trial. The trial approached but did not meet statistical significance (p=0.0603) in the primary efficacy endpoint of the number of days on oxygen through Day 29. All prespecified secondary endpoints in the study numerically favored fostamatinib over placebo, including mortality, time to sustained recovery, change in ordinal scale assessment, and number of days in the ICU. We are evaluating the opportunity and discussing next steps with the FDA and in collaboration with our partner, the US Department of Defense.
​
In June 2021, we announced that fostamatinib has been selected for the NIH ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial, initiated and funded by NHLBI, is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of therapies, including fostamatinib, targeting the host response to COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. The ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial is evaluating fostamatinib in a targeted population of approximately 600 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 300 fostamatinib versus 300 placebo. An interim analysis of the trial was completed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board with a recommendation for the trial to continue.
Fostamatinib in wAIHA 
In June 2022, we announced top-line efficacy and safety data results from our FORWARD study, a Phase 3 pivotal trial of fostamatinib, an oral SYK inhibitor, in patients with wAIHA, which we initiated in March 2019. We completed the enrollment of our FORWARD study in November 2021 with 90 patients enrolled and completed the treatment period for the last patient under the study in April 2022. The results of the trial did not demonstrate statistical significance in the primary efficacy endpoint of durable hemoglobin response in the overall study population. For more detailed discussions of the results of the trial, refer to “Clinical Stage Programs” section below. We conducted an in-depth analysis of these data to better understand differences in patient characteristics and outcomes and submitted these findings to the FDA. In October 2022, we announced that we received guidance from the FDA’s review of these findings. Based on the result of the trial and the guidance from the FDA, we did not file a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for this indication. 
Global Strategic Partnership with Lilly
We have a global exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Lilly (the Lilly Agreement) entered in February 2021, to develop and commercialize R552, a RIPK1 inhibitor, for the treatment of non-central nervous system (non-CNS) diseases. In addition, the collaboration is aimed at developing additional RIPK1 inhibitors for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we granted to Lilly the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize R552 and related RIPK1 inhibitors in all indications worldwide. 
We are responsible for 20% of the development costs for R552 in the US, Europe, and Japan, up to a specified cap. Lilly is responsible for funding the remainder of all development activities for R552 and other non-CNS disease development candidates. We have the right to opt-out of co-funding the R552 development activities in the US, Europe and Japan at two different specified times. If we exercise our first opt-out right (no later than September 30, 2023), we are required to fund our share of the R552 development activities in the US, Europe, and Japan up to a maximum funding commitment of $65.0 million through April 1, 2024. Through December 31, 2022, Lilly billed us $15.1 million of the funding development costs and the amounts were fully paid as of December 31, 2022. Under the Lilly Agreement, we were responsible for performing and funding initial discovery and identification of CNS disease development candidates, and following candidate selection, Lilly will be responsible for performing and funding all future development and commercialization of the CNS disease development candidates. In June 2022, Lilly provided notice of continuance pursuant to the terms of the Lilly Agreement, whereby Lilly elected its option to lead the identification and selection of CNS penetrant lead candidate. 

Lilly is continuing to advance R552, with an initial Phase 2a trial in active rheumatoid arthritis. This initial Phase 2a trial in approximately 100 patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis is anticipated to 

6



begin in the first half of 2023 and will involve global recruitment. RIPK1 is implicated in a broad range of key inflammatory cellular processes and plays a key role in Tumor Necrosis Factor signaling, especially in the induction of pro-inflammatory necroptosis. The program also includes RIPK1 compounds that cross the blood-brain barrier (CNS-penetrants) to address neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The Phase 2a trial analysis is expected by the end of 2024.
Patent Infringement Lawsuit
In June 2022, we received a notice letter regarding an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) submitted to the FDA by Annora Pharma Private Limited (Annora), requesting approval to market a generic version of TAVALISSE. On July 25, 2022, we filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Annora and its subsidiaries for infringement of certain of our US patents. For a more detailed discussion of this litigation matter, see “Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Update on Current and Potential Future Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business and operations. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business and operations in the future will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control. The ultimate potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial condition is highly uncertain and subject to change, and as such, we cannot ascertain the full extent of the impacts on our sales of our products, our ability to continue to secure new collaborations and support existing collaboration efforts with our partners and our clinical and regulatory activities. Periodic resurgence of COVID-19 cases negatively impacted and may continue to impact our ability to grow our product sales. When COVID-19 cases surged, we have observed reduced patient-doctor interactions and our representatives had fewer visits with health care providers. 

We continue to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to undertake safety measures to keep our staff, patients, investigators and stockholders safe. We have a Crisis Management Team (CMT) that implements and monitors our business continuity plans to prevent or minimize business disruption and ensure the safety and well-being of our personnel. We also have a COVID-19 Headquarters Policy (Plan) in place to provide guidelines when working onsite. We continue to evaluate the workplace for compliance with the local, state and federal guidance and may modify or update at any time to ensure the safety of our employees, contractors and visitors. During the first quarter of 2022, we updated our Plan as we move towards a hybrid schedule, reinstituting more in-person interactions beginning April 2022. We endeavor to provide the safest and most effective work environment under the circumstances, but we cannot guarantee that employees who come to the office will not be exposed to COVID-19 while at the office. It will be the responsibility of all employees to participate and cooperate in safety and cleaning protocols. We expect all employees, contractors, and visitors to our facility to comply with the Plan. With respect to our supply chain, we did not experience significant disruptions in the supply chain for our commercial product.

Strategy
Our goal is to establish ourselves as a successful commercial stage biopharmaceutical company with significant development capabilities. We aim to expand our commercial business in the US on our own and globally through partnerships. We expanded our hematology-oncology portfolio with our recently launched commercial product REZLIDHIA, which is highly synergistic with our existing hematology-oncology focused commercial infrastructure. We continue our research and development of novel therapies designed to significantly improve the lives of patients with hematological disorders and cancer. We continue to maintain a strong commercial team in the US to enable us to execute successfully on our commercialization strategy for TAVALISSE in chronic ITP and REZLIDHIA for treatment of R/R AML patients with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. We entered into partnerships for the expansion of fostamatinib outside of US, and will be focusing on the further development of the utility of fostamatinib and olutasidenib in other indications on our own or through our partners. We also aim to expand our development pipeline on our own and/or with partnerships with pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies to further develop and market additional product candidates.
In particular, the key elements that we believe are value drivers, which we plan to continue to execute include:


● | growing sales of TAVALISSE in the estimated over $2.0 billion global ITP market;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding our hematology-oncology portfolio with REZLIDHIA for treatment of R/R AML patients with a susceptible IDH1 mutation, a well-identified patient population of approximately 1,000 patients, part of an AML market estimated to have an incidence of 20,000 cases in the US and estimated 120,000 cases globally; and

TAVALISSE/Fostamatinib in ITP
Disease background. Chronic ITP affects an estimated 81,300 adult patients in the US. In patients with ITP, the immune system attacks and destroys the body’s own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. ITP patients can suffer extraordinary bruising, bleeding and fatigue as a result of low platelet counts. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters that imitate thrombopoietin (TPO) and splenectomy.
​
Orally-available fostamatinib program. Taken in tablet form, fostamatinib blocks the activation of SYK inside immune cells. ITP is typically characterized by the body producing antibodies that attach to healthy platelets in the blood stream. Immune cells recognize these antibodies and affix to them, which activates the SYK enzyme inside the immune cell, and triggers the destruction of the antibody and the attached platelet. When SYK is inhibited by fostamatinib, it interrupts this immune cell function and allows the platelets to escape destruction. The results of our Phase 2 clinical trial, in which fostamatinib was orally administered to 16 adults with chronic ITP, published in Blood, showed that fostamatinib significantly increased the platelet counts of certain ITP patients, including those who had failed other currently available agents.
​
Our Fostamatinib for Immune Thrombocytopenia (FIT) Phase 3 clinical program had a total of 150 ITP patients which were randomized into two identical multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The patients were diagnosed with persistent or chronic ITP, and had blood platelet counts consistently below 30,000 per microliter of blood. Two-thirds of the subjects received fostamatinib orally at 100 mg twice daily (bid) and the other third received placebo on the same schedule. Subjects were expected to remain on treatment for up to 24 weeks. At week four of treatment, subjects who failed to meet certain platelet counts and met certain tolerability thresholds could have their dosage of fostamatinib (or corresponding placebo) increased to 150 mg bid. The primary efficacy endpoint of this program was a stable platelet response by week 24 with platelet counts at or above 50,000 per microliter of blood for at least four of the final six qualifying blood draws. In August 2015, the FDA granted our request for Orphan Drug designation for fostamatinib for the treatment of ITP. 


In August 2016, we announced the results of the first FIT study, reporting that fostamatinib met the study’s primary efficacy endpoint. The study showed that 18% of patients receiving fostamatinib achieved a stable platelet response compared to none receiving a placebo control (p=0.0261). In October 2016, we announced the results of the second FIT study, reporting that the response rate (16% in the treatment group, versus 4% in the placebo group) was consistent with the first study, although the difference was not statistically significant. In the ITP double-blind studies, the most commonly-reported adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with TAVALISSE were diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, dizziness, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, respiratory infection, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, chest pain, and neutropenia. Serious adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with TAVALISSE in the ITP double-blind studies were febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis.
TAVALISSE was approved by the FDA in April 2018 for the treatment of ITP in adult patients who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment, and successfully launched in the US in May 2018. In January 2020, the European Commission (EC) granted our Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe for fostamatinib (TAVLESSE) for the treatment of chronic ITP in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. In February 2020, Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei) was granted orphan drug designation from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for R788 (fostamatinib) in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura for fostamatinib in chronic ITP. In December 2022, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) approved the NDA for fostamatinib in chronic ITP.
A post-hoc analysis from our Phase 3 clinical program in adult patients with chronic ITP, highlighting the potential benefit of using TAVALISSE in earlier lines of therapy, was published in the British Journal of Haematology in July 2020. Inclusion in one of the leading peer-reviewed journals in the field of hematology underscores the significance of the 78% (25/32) response rate defined as at least one platelet count of at least 50,000/µL when TAVALISSE was used as a second-line therapy in our Phase 3 clinical program. Adverse events were manageable and

consistent with those previously reported with fostamatinib. Our sales force is sharing this data with physicians.
Commercial activities, including sales and marketing
Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on hematologists and hematologist-oncologists in the US who manage chronic adult ITP patients. We have a fully integrated commercial team consisting of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. Our sales team promotes our products in the US using customary pharmaceutical company practices, and we concentrate our efforts on hematologists and hematologists-oncologists. Our products are sold initially through third-party wholesale distribution and specialty pharmacy channels and group purchasing organizations before being ultimately prescribed to patients. To facilitate our commercial activities in the US, we also enter into arrangements with various third parties, including advertising agencies, market research firms and other sales-support-related services as needed. We believe that our commercial team and distribution practices are adequate to ensure that our marketing efforts reach relevant customers and deliver our products to patients in a timely and compliant fashion. Also, to help ensure that all eligible patients in the US have appropriate access to our products, we have established a reimbursement and patient support program called Rigel OneCare (ROC). Through ROC, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and also provide free product to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain established clinical and financial eligibility criteria. In addition, ROC is designed to provide reimbursement support, such as information related to prior authorizations, benefits investigations and appeals. 
In addition, our collaborative partner Grifols has launched TAVLESSE in the UK and certain countries in Europe including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, and continues a phased rollout across the rest of Europe. Also, our collaborative partner Medison has launched TAVALISSE in Canada and Israel.
Competitive landscape for TAVALISSE
Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. TAVALISSE is competing with other existing therapies. In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. For example, there are existing therapies and drug candidates in development for the treatment of ITP that may be alternative therapies to TAVALISSE. 
Currently, corticosteroids remain the most common first line therapy for ITP, occasionally in conjunction with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or anti-Rh(D) to help further augment platelet count recovery, particularly in emergency situations. However, it has been estimated that frontline agents lead to durable remissions in only a small percentage of newly-diagnosed adults with ITP. Moreover, concerns with steroid-related side effects often restrict therapy to approximately four weeks. As such, many patients progress to persistent or chronic ITP, requiring other forms of therapeutic intervention. In long-term treatment of chronic ITP, patients are often cycled through several therapies over time in order to maintain a sufficient response to the disease.
Other approaches to treat ITP are varied in their mechanism of action, and there is no consensus about the sequence of their use. Options include splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and various immunosuppressants (such as rituximab). The response rate criteria of the above-mentioned options vary, precluding a comparison of response rates for individual therapies. 
Even with the above treatment options, a significant number of patients remain severely thrombocytopenic for long durations and are subject to risk of spontaneous or trauma-induced hemorrhage. The addition of fostamatinib to the currently available treatment options could be beneficial because it has a different mechanism of action than any of the therapies that are currently available. Fostamatinib is a potent and relatively selective SYK inhibitor, and its inhibition of Fc receptors and B-cell receptors of signaling pathways make it a potentially broad immunomodulatory agent. 
Other products in the US that are approved by the FDA to increase platelet production through binding to TPO receptors on megakaryocyte precursors include PROMACTA® (Novartis International AG (Novartis)), Nplate® (Amgen, Inc.) and DOPTELET® (Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB). In the longer term, we may eventually face competition from potential manufacturers of generic versions of our marketed products, including the proposed generic version of TAVALISSE that is the subject of an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Annora, which, if approved and allowed to enter 

10



the market, it could result in significant decreases in the revenue derived from sale of TAVALISSE and thereby materially harm our business and financial condition. 
Fostamatinib in Global Markets
We have entered into various license agreements to commercialize fostamatinib globally. The following describes the arrangements we have in place with Grifols, Kissei, Medison Pharma Trading AG (Medison Canada) and Medison Pharma Ltd. (Medison Israel, and together with Medison Canada, Medison), and Knight Therapeutics International SA (Knight). We retain the global rights to fostamatinib outside of the Grifols, Kissei, Medison and Knight territories.
Fostamatinib in Europe/Turkey
In January 2019, we entered into a commercialization license agreement with Grifols with exclusive rights to commercialize fostamatinib for human diseases, including chronic ITP and AIHA, and non-exclusive rights to develop, fostamatinib in their territory. Grifols territory includes Europe, the UK, Turkey, the Middle East, North Africa and Russia (including Commonwealth of Independent States). 
We are responsible for performing and funding certain development activities for fostamatinib for ITP and AIHA and Grifols is responsible for all other development activities for fostamatinib in such territories. We remain responsible for the manufacturing and supply of fostamatinib for all development and commercialization activities under the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $30.0 million and will be eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $297.5 million. In January 2020, the EC granted a MA for fostamatinib for the treatment of chronic ITP in adult patients who are refractory to other treatments. With this approval, we received a $20.0 million non-refundable milestone payment, consisted of a $17.5 million payment due upon MAA approval by the EMA of fostamatinib for the first indication and a $2.5 million creditable advance royalty payment due upon EMA approval of fostamatinib in the first indication. We will also receive tiered royalty payments ranging from the mid-teens to 30% of net sales of fostamatinib in the Grifols Territory. 
Fostamatinib in Japan/Asia 
In October 2018, we entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement with Kissei to develop and commercialize fostamatinib in all current and potential indications in Japan, China, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea. Kissei is a Japan-based pharmaceutical company addressing patients’ unmet medical needs through its research, development and commercialization efforts, as well as through collaborations with partners. 
Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $33.0 million, with the potential for an additional $147.0 million in development and commercial milestone payments, and will receive product transfer price payments in the mid to upper twenty percent range based on tiered net sales for the exclusive supply of fostamatinib. Kissei receives exclusive rights to fostamatinib in ITP and all future indications in Japan, China, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea. 
In September 2019, Kissei initiated a Phase 3 trial in Japan of fostamatinib in adult patients with chronic ITP. The efficacy and safety of orally administered fostamatinib was assessed by comparing it with placebo in a randomized, double-blind study. Japan has the third highest prevalence of chronic ITP in the world behind the US and Europe. In February 2020, Kissei was granted orphan drug designation from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for R788 (fostamatinib) in chronic ITP. In December 2021, Kissei reported positive top-line results for a Phase 3 clinical trial of fostamatinib in adult Japanese patients with chronic ITP, meeting its primary endpoint. The Phase 3 clinical trial showed that patients receiving fostamatinib achieved a stable platelet response significantly higher than patients receiving a placebo control. A stable platelet response was defined as achieving greater than or equal to 50,000 platelets per microliter of blood on at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 14 and 24 of treatment. Based on the positive Phase 3 results, in April 2022, Kissei submitted an NDA to Japan’s PMDA for fostamatinib in chronic ITP. With this milestone event, during the second quarter of 2022, we received $5.0 million non-refundable and non-creditable payment from Kissei based on the terms of our collaboration agreement, and such amount was recognized as revenue in the second quarter of 2022. In December 2022, Japan’s PMDA approved TAVALISSE for the treatment of chronic ITP. With this milestone event, we are entitled to receive $20.0 million non-refundable and non-creditable 

11



payment from Kissei based on the terms of our collaboration agreement, and such amount was recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. The amount was subsequently collected in January 2023.
 Fostamatinib in Canada/Israel 
​
In October 2019, we entered into exclusive commercial and license agreements with Medison to commercialize fostamatinib in all potential indications in Canada and Israel. Under the terms of the agreements, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million with the potential for approximately $35.0 million in regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, we will receive royalty payments beginning at 30% of net sales. Under our agreement with Medison for the Canada territory, we have the option to buy back all rights to the product upon regulatory approval in Canada for the indication of AIHA. The buyback provision, if exercised, would require both parties to mutually agree on commercially reasonable terms for us to purchase back the rights, taking into account Medison’s investment and the value of the rights, among others. Pursuant to this exclusive commercialization license agreement, in August 2020, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Medison.

REZLIDHIA in R/R AML with mIDH1
Disease background. mIDH1 alterations are seen in AML, glioma, chondrosarcoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. It is estimated that there are approximately 1,000 adult patients, a well-identified patient population, with mIDH1 R/R AML, part of an AML market estimated to have an incidence of 20,000 cases in the US and estimated 120,000 cases globally. Despite having approved treatment options for R/R AML patients who are mIDH1 positive, an unmet need remains. Olutasidenib may represent a treatment option with durable remissions, reduced QTc potential, and a stable pharmacokinetics profile that enables a consistent drug exposure over time. 
In July 2022, we entered into a license and transition agreement with Forma for an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize olutasidenib, Forma’s proprietary inhibitor of mIDH1, for any uses worldwide, including for the treatment of R/R AML and other malignancies. Olutasidenib is an oral, small molecule drug designed to selectively bind to and inhibit mIDH1. This targeted agent has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit by reducing 2-hydroxyglutarate levels and restoring normal cellular differentiation. IDH1 is a natural enzyme that is part of the normal metabolism of all cells. When mutated, IDH1 activity can promote blood malignancies and solid tumors.
​
Orally-available olutasidenib program. REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) is an oral, small molecule, inhibitor of mIDH1 designed to bind to and inhibit mIDH1 to reduce 2-hydroxyglutarate levels and restore normal cellular differentiation of myeloid cells. REZLIDHIA is a novel, non-intensive monotherapy treatment in the R/R AML setting demonstrating a CR+CRh rate of 35% in patients with over 90% of those responders in complete remission. The safety of REZLIDHIA 150 mg administered twice daily was evaluated in 153 adults with relapsed or refractory AML with an IDH1 mutation.

On December 1, 2022, the FDA has approved REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) capsules for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML with IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA approved test. On December 22, 2022, we began the commercialization of REZLIDHIA and made it available to patients. The recommended dosage of REZLIDHIA is 150 mg taken orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The FDA approval was based on the NDA for olutasidenib for the treatment of m1DH1 R/R AML submitted by Forma, that had a PDUFA action date for the application of February 15, 2023. The NDA application was supported with Forma’s Phase 2 registrational trial for olutasidenib in mIDH1 R/R AML. Interim results from Forma’s Phase 2 registrational trial were reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in June 2021. The interim results of this trial of 153 patients showed that olutasidenib demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile as a monotherapy in patients with R/R AML who have a susceptible mIDH1, and achieved a composite complete remission (CR), or CR plus CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) rate of 33.3% (30% CR and 3% CRh), the primary efficacy endpoint. While a median duration of CR/CRh was not yet reached, a sensitivity analysis (with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HCST, as the end of a response) indicated the median duration of CR/CRh was 13.8 months. The overall response rate, comprised CR, CRh, CRi, partial response, and morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), was 46% and the median duration of ORR was 11.7 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 10.5 months. For patients with CR/CRh, the median OS was not reached, but the estimated 18-month survival was 87%. The most frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events were nausea, constipation, increased white blood cell count , decreased RBC count, pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, and fatigue. Subsequently, Forma presented the first Phase 2 results of olutasidenib used in combination with azacitidine, including safety/tolerability data, at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2021. Olutasidenib was designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in April 2017.
On November 3, 2022, we announced the presentation of five posters highlighting data from our commercial and clinical hematology-oncology portfolio at the 64th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition which was held in December 2022. An updated interim analysis from the Phase 2 registrational trial of olutasidenib in patients with R/R AML demonstrated robust efficacy and safety results. The registrational cohort of the Phase 2 trial enrolled 153 patients with mIDH1 R/R AML who received olutasidenib monotherapy 150 mg twice daily. The efficacy evaluable population was 147 patients who received their first dose at least six months prior to the interim analysis cutoff date of June 18, 2021. The primary endpoint was a CR/CRh defined as less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets >50,000/microliter and absolute neutrophil count >500/microliter). Overall response rate comprises CR, CRh, CR with incomplete blood count recovery, partial response and MLFS. The results from the updated interim analysis of patients with mIDH1 R/R AML demonstrated a 35% CR+CRh rate with a median duration of 25.9 months. Olutasidenib was effective in a broad range of patients including those with prior high-intensity chemotherapy and/or post-venetoclax. The abstract concluded that the observed activity is clinically meaningful and represents a therapeutic advance in the treatment of this patient population. In this pivotal cohort, olutasidenib was well tolerated with an adverse event profile largely characteristic of symptoms or conditions experienced by patients undergoing treatment for AML or of the underlying disease itself.
​
On November 10, 2022, we announced the publication of data in The Lancet Haematology, which summarizes the Phase 1 results of the Phase 1/2 trial of olutasidenib. The objectives of the first phase of the multi-center, open-label Phase 1/2 trial were to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, and clinical activity of olutasidenib, both as monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine, in patients with treatment-naïve or R/R AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) harboring IDH1 mutations. The published data suggest that olutasidenib, with or without azacitidine, was well-tolerated and was associated with improvements in clinical efficacy endpoints in patients with mIDH1 AML. This trial showed that olutasidenib has the potential to provide an additional treatment option for mIDH1 AML.
​
In January 2023, we announced that REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) has been added by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) to the latest NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for AML. REZLIDHIA is now included as a recommended targeted therapy for adult patients with R/R AML with IDH1 mutation. 
​

In February 2023, we announced peer-reviewed publication data in Blood Advances, which summarize clinical results from the Phase 2 registrational trial of REZLIDHIA (olutasidenib) in patients with mIDH1 R/R AML. The published data demonstrate that REZLIDHIA induced durable remissions and transfusion independence with a well-characterized safety profile. The observed efficacy is clinically meaningful and represents a therapeutic advance in this poor prognosis patient population with limited treatment options. REZLIDHIA demonstrated both a high rate of response and an extended median duration of complete response of 28.1 months, which is more than a year longer than what is reported with the SoC.
We plan to pursue strategic actions to further develop olutasidenib for the treatment of other malignancies and expansion of commercialization. 
Commercial activities, including sales and marketing
REZLIDHIA is highly synergistic with our existing hematology-oncology focused commercial and medical affairs infrastructure. Our commercial efforts will focus on targeting hematologists and hematologist-oncologists who manage patients with R/R AML with mIDH1. We plan to enter collaborations with third parties to commercialize REZLIDHIA outside of US.
Competitive landscape for REZLIDHIA
There is currently one other product approved in the US for patients with IDH1 mutation. The FDA granted approval to TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib), an oral targeted IDH1 mutation inhibitor, (i) in July 2018, for adult patients with R/R AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation, (ii) in May 2019, for newly diagnosed AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation who are at least 75 years old or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy, (iii) in August 2021, for adult patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test, and (iv) in May 2022, in combination with azacitidine (azacitidine for injection) for newly diagnosed AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test in adults 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. In addition, some clinicians may utilize non-targeted treatments for patients with mIDH1 R/R AML, including use of venetoclax combinations, hypomethylating agents, other chemotherapy regimens, or investigational agents that may be available to them.
Clinical Stage Programs
​
R289, an Oral IRAK1/4 Inhibitor for Autoimmune, Inflammatory and Hematology-Oncology Diseases
​
Orally Available IRAK 1/4 Inhibitor Program. During the second quarter of 2018, we selected R835, the active metabolite of R289, a proprietary molecule from our IRAK 1/4 preclinical development program, for human clinical trials. This investigational candidate is an orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of IRAK1 and IRAK4 that blocks inflammatory cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) and the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family signaling. TLRs and IL-1Rs play a critical role in the innate immune response and dysregulation of these pathways can lead to a variety of inflammatory conditions including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and gout (among others). R835 prevents cytokine release in response to TLR and IL-1R activation in vitro. R835 is active in multiple rodent models of inflammatory disease including psoriasis, arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis and gout. Preclinical studies show that R835 inhibits both the IRAK1 and IRAK4 signaling pathways, which play a key role in inflammation and immune responses to tissue damage. Dual inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4 allows for more complete suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine release than inhibition of either one individually.
In October 2019, we announced results from a Phase 1 clinical trial of R835 in healthy subjects to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics. The Phase 1 trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in 91 healthy subjects, ages 18 to 55. The Phase 1 trial showed positive tolerability and PK data as well as established proof-of-mechanism by demonstrating the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production in response to a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. 

14



We continue to advance the development of our IRAK1/4 program, completing the evaluation of a new pro-drug formulation of R835, R289, in single-ascending and multiple ascending dose studies with positive safety results in 2021. In January 2022, we received clearance from the FDA on our clinical trial design to explore R289 in low-risk MDS. The open-label, Phase 1b trial will determine the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of R289 in patients with low-risk MDS who are refractory or resistant to prior therapies. In December 2022, we announced that we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1b trial of R289. The Phase 1b trial of R289 is expected to enroll approximately 22 patients. The primary objective of the trial is safety, with secondary and exploratory objectives to assess preliminary efficacy and characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of R289. The safety and efficacy data from this Phase 1b trial, along with the safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data from the completed first-in-human study in heathy volunteers, are intended to be used to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose for future clinical development of R289 targeting lower-risk MDS. 
Fostamatinib in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients
​
Disease background. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the upper and lower respiratory tract and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, some patients develop other organ dysfunction including myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, shock resulting in endothelial dysfunction and subsequently micro and macrovascular thrombosis. Much of the underlying pathology of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be secondary to a hyperinflammatory immune response associated with increased risk of thrombosis. SYK is involved in the intracellular signaling pathways of many different immune cells. Therefore, SYK inhibition may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 via inhibition of key Fc gamma receptor and c-type lectin receptor mediated drivers of pathology, such as inflammatory cytokine release by monocytes and macrophages, production of NETs by neutrophils, and platelet aggregation. Furthermore, SYK inhibition in neutrophils and platelets may lead to decreased thromboinflammation, alleviating organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with COVID-19.


Rigel-led Phase 3 Trial. In November 2020, we launched our FOCUS Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without respiratory failure that have certain high-risk prognostic factors. In January 2021, we were awarded $16.5 million from the US Department of Defense’s Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) to support this Phase 3 clinical trial. This multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive design study randomly assigns either fostamatinib plus SoC or matched placebo plus SoC (1:1) to targeted evaluable patients. Treatment is administered orally twice daily for 14 days with follow up to day 60. In December 2021, we expanded the inclusion criteria to include patients with more severe disease (NIAID Ordinal Scale 6) to more accurately reflect the clinically predominant patient population hospitalized with COVID-19 and help speed enrollment. In collaboration with the FDA and Department of Defense, we also updated the primary endpoint for the trial from progression to severe disease within 29 days, to the number of days on oxygen through day 29. This endpoint allows for closer comparison of the results with earlier results from the NIH/NHLBI Phase 2 clinical trial with fostamatinib and various other NIH-sponsored trials, such as the ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial, which uses a similar outcome measure as a primary endpoint. In July 2022, we completed enrollment with 280 patients. The trial had originally targeted a total of 308 patients; however, we determined the trial would be sufficiently powered with 280 patients to potentially provide a clinically meaningful result and determine the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. On November 1, 2022, we announced the top-line results of the FOCUS trial. The trial approached but did not meet statistical significance (p=0.0603) in the primary efficacy endpoint of the number of days on oxygen through Day 29. All prespecified secondary endpoints in the trial numerically favored fostamatinib over placebo, including mortality, time to sustained recovery, change in ordinal scale assessment, and number of days in the ICU. We are evaluating the opportunity and discussing next steps with the FDA and in collaboration with our partner, the US Department of Defense. 
NIH/NHLBI-sponsored Phase 2 Trial. In September 2020, we announced a Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by the NIH/NHLBI to evaluate the safety of fostamatinib for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned fostamatinib or matched placebo (1:1) to 59 evaluable patients. Treatment was administered orally twice daily for 14 days, and a follow-up period to day 60. The primary endpoint of this trial was cumulative incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) through day 29. The trial also included multiple secondary endpoints designed to assess the early efficacy and clinically relevant endpoints of disease course. 

15



The trial completed the enrollment in March 2021. In April 2021, we announced that the Phase 2 clinical trial met its primary endpoint of safety. Fostamatinib reduced the incidence of SAEs by half. By day 29, there were three SAEs in the fostamatinib plus SoC group of thirty patients compared to six SAEs in the placebo plus SoC group of twenty-nine patients (p=0.23). Of these, there was a reduction for the disease related SAE of hypoxia in the fostamatinib group compared to placebo (1 vs 3, respectively; p=0.29). The data from the NIH/NHLBI-Sponsored Phase 2 trial was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, an official publication of the Infectious Disease Society of America in September 2021. 
In May 2021, the NIH/NHLBI Phase 2 clinical data were submitted as part of a request for an EUA from the FDA for fostamatinib as a treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In August 2021, the FDA informed us that the clinical data submitted from the NIH/NHLBI-sponsored Phase 2 trial of fostamatinib to treat hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19 was insufficient for an EUA. 

ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Phase 2/3 Trial.  In June 2021, we announced that fostamatinib had been selected for the NIH ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial, initiated and funded by NHLBI, is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of therapies, including fostamatinib, targeting the host response to COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. The master protocol for this trial was designed to be flexible in the number of study arms, the use of a single placebo group, and the stopping and adding of new therapies. Eligible participants include patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a new need for oxygen therapy. The primary outcome is oxygen-free days through day 28. Secondary outcomes include 28-day hospital mortality, use of mechanical ventilation, and severity of disease as measured by World Health Organization (WHO) scale scores. The ACTIV-4 Host Tissue Trial is evaluating fostamatinib in a targeted population of approximately 600 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 300 fostamatinib versus 300 placebo. An interim analysis of the trial was completed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board with a recommendation for the trial to continue.
Imperial College of London Phase 2 Trial. In July 2020, we announced a Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by Imperial College of London to evaluate the efficacy of fostamatinib for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a two-stage, open label, controlled clinical trial with patients randomized (1:1:1) to fostamatinib plus SoC, ruxolitinib plus SoC, or SoC alone. Treatment was administered twice daily for 14 days and patients receive a follow-up assessment at day 14 and day 28 after the first dose. The primary endpoint of this trial is progression from mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia within 14 days in hospitalized patients (WHO COVID-19 Severity Scale 3-4). In April 2022, Imperial College of London completed a pre-planned interim analysis of the primary endpoint, patients progressing from mild or moderate (modified WHO COVID-19 scale 3-4) to severe disease (modified WHO COVID-19 scale ≥5) within 14 days, in the Phase 2 MATIS trial. The independent data monitoring committee determined that the fostamatinib plus SoC arm did not meet the prespecified criteria for continuation to the next stage of the trial. No safety concerns were identified. The trial remains blinded and Imperial College of London plans to share results with us and scientific community once the trial is complete. 
Other Publications. Researchers at MIT and Harvard led a screen to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. MUC1 is a biomarker used to predict the development of ALI and ARDS and correlates with poor clinical outcomes. In June 2020, the results were presented, and of the 3,713 compounds that were screened, fostamatinib was the only compound identified which both decreased expression of MUC1 and is FDA approved. Fostamatinib demonstrated preferential depletion of MUC1 from epithelial cells without affecting cell viability. The research was focused on drug repurposing for the much lower risk of toxicity and the ability of FDA-approved treatments to be delivered on a shortened timescale, which is critical for patients afflicted with lung disease resulting from COVID-19.
In addition, the in vitro studies led by the Amsterdam University Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam, showed that R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib, blocked macrophage hyperinflammatory responses to a combination of immune complexes formed by anti-Spike IgG in serum from severe COVID-19 patients. Anti-Spike IgG levels are known to correlate with the severity of COVID-19. These results, presented in July 2020, suggest that by inhibiting anti-Spike IgG-mediated hyperinflammation, R406 could potentially play a role in the prevention of cytokine storms as well as pulmonary edema and thrombosis associated with severe COVID-19.

16



In December 2020, the Journal of Infectious Diseases published research from NIH which demonstrated that R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib, was able to inhibit NETosis ex vivo in donor plasma from patients with COVID-19. NETosis is a unique type of cell death resulting in the release of NETs. NETs contribute to thromboinflammation and have been associated with mortality in COVID-19. These data provide insights for how fostamatinib may mitigate neutrophil-associated mechanisms contributing to COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.

Fostamatinib in wAIHA
​
Disease background. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a rare, serious blood disorder where the immune system produces antibodies that result in the destruction of the body’s own red blood cells. Symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, jaundice or enlarged spleen. While no medical treatments are currently approved for AIHA, physicians generally treat acute and chronic cases of the disorder with corticosteroids, other immuno-suppressants, or splenectomy. Research has shown that inhibiting SYK with fostamatinib may reduce the destruction of red blood cells. AIHA affects an estimated 45,000 Americans, and approximately 36,000 of those patients have wAIHA, where no approved treatment options currently exist.
​
Orally-available fostamatinib program. We completed our Phase 2 clinical trial, also known as the SOAR study, in patients with wAIHA. This trial was an open-label, multi-center, two-stage study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in patients with wAIHA who had previously received treatment for the disorder but have relapsed. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was to achieve increased hemoglobin levels by week 12 of greater than 10 g/dL, and greater than or equal to 2 g/dL higher than baseline. In November 2019, we announced updated data that in a Phase 2 open-label study of fostamatinib in patients with wAIHA, data showed that 44% (11/25) of evaluable patients met the primary efficacy endpoint of a Hgb level >10 g/dL with an increase of ≥2 g/dL from baseline by week 24. Including one late responder at week 30, the overall response rate was 48% (12/25). Adverse events were manageable and consistent with those previously reported with fostamatinib. In February 2022, the American Journal of Hematology published the data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of fostamatinib in adults with wAIHA who have failed at least one prior treatment. The published data demonstrate that fostamatinib rapidly and durably increased hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, with clinically meaningful Hgb responses observed in nearly half of the patients, and a safety and tolerability profile consistent with the existing fostamatinib safety database of patients across multiple disease programs studied. 
In January 2021, we announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation to fostamatinib for the treatment of wAIHA. The FDA previously granted fostamatinib Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of wAIHA in January 2018.




In March 2019, we initiated our wAIHA pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of fostamatinib, known as the FORWARD study. The clinical trial protocol calls for a placebo-controlled study of 90 patients with primary or secondary wAIHA who have failed at least one prior treatment. The primary endpoint is a durable Hgb response, defined as Hgb >10 g/dL and >2 g/dL increase from baseline and durability measure, with the response not being attributed to rescue therapy. In November 2020, we reached an agreement with the FDA on the durable response measure for the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial as well as the inclusion of additional secondary endpoints. In November 2021, we completed the enrollment of this study. In April 2022, we completed the treatment period for the last patient under the trial. In June 2022, we announced top-line efficacy and safety data from the FORWARD study with 90 patients. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive fostamatinib or matching placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of Hgb response was defined as achieving a Hgb ≥10 g/dL with an increase from baseline ≥2 g/dL on three consecutive available visits during the 24-week treatment period. The trial did not demonstrate statistical significance in the primary efficacy endpoint of durable hemoglobin response in the overall study population. The trial also included key secondary endpoints, including hemoglobin response on at least one visit, change in Hgb from baseline of ≥2 g/dL, use of permitted rescue therapy after week 4, change in Hgb from baseline to end of treatment and change from baseline to week 24 in FACIT-F scale. Across the trial’s overall patient population, fostamatinib was generally well-tolerated. The safety profile of the product was consistent with prior clinical experience and no new safety issues were discovered. The most common adverse events (≥10%) with fostamatinib and placebo were diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea, and dyspnea. Treatment-related SAEs were 6.7% (3/45) for fostamatinib and 4.4% (2/45) for placebo. There were five deaths on the trial (2 with fostamatinib and 3 with placebo), all of which were determined to be unrelated to study drug. The safety results were consistent with the overall safety profile data collected to date, which includes more than 5,000 patients 

17



across multiple diseases. We conducted an in-depth analysis of these data to better understand differences in patient characteristics and outcomes and submitted these findings to the FDA. In October 2022, we announced that we received guidance from the FDA’s review of these findings. Based on the result of the trial and the guidance from the FDA, we did not file an sNDA for this indication. 
Of the 90 patients that completed the FORWARD study, 71 (79%) enrolled in the open-label extension study. We plan on closing this study in 2023. 
Partnered Clinical Programs 
BGB324 – BerGenBio 
We have an exclusive, worldwide research, development and commercialization agreement with BerGenBio for our investigational AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, BGB324/R428 (now referred to as bemcentinib). In October 2022, BerGenBio announced the initiation of a Phase 1b/2a trial evaluating bemcentinib in combination with the current SoC, checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and doublet chemotheraphy, for the treatment of first line non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring serine/threonine kinase 11 mutations. In February 2023, BerGenBio also announced positive data from Phase 2 trial of bemcentinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with 2L+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The treatment with bemcentinib in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated long survival benefit and sustained disease control, particularly in patients with AXL TPS > 5, substantiating the relevance of AXL as a target and bemcentinib’s selective inhibition capabilities in NSCLC. The product is also being investigated in Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with AML and COVID-19. Bemcentinib is being studied in over 600 patients, demonstrating its safety as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotheraphy and immune checkpoint inhibition. 

DS-3032 - Daiichi
DS-3032 is an investigational oral selective inhibitor of the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein investigated by Daiichi in three Phase 1 clinical trials for solid and hematological malignancies including AML, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase, lymphoma and MDS. Preliminary safety and efficacy data from a Phase 1 trial of DS-3032 suggests that DS-3032 may be a promising treatment for hematological malignancies including R/R AML and high-risk MDS. 
In September 2020, worldwide rights to DS-3032 (milademetan) were out-licensed from Daiichi to Rain Oncology Inc., formerly Rain Therapeutics Inc. (Rain). In July 2021, Rain announced that it initiated a Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of milademetan (RAIN-32) for the treatment of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma, a rare cancer originating from fat cells located in the soft tissues of the body and in August 2022, Rain announced the completion of enrollment of its Phase 3 trial for milademetan in liposarcoma. In late 2021, Rain commenced its second clinical trial for RAIN-32 in patients with MDM2-amplified advance solid tumors, and in November 2022, Rain provided an interim analysis of the trial which showed that the drug safety profile of milademetan is preliminary consistent with its prior Phase 1 trial.

We seek US and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including new screening methodologies and other research tools, target molecules that are associated with disease states identified in our screens, and lead compounds that can affect disease pathways. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various license agreements that give us rights to use technologies in our research and development.
 We currently hold a number of issued patents in the US, as well as corresponding applications that allow us to pursue patents in other countries, some of which have been allowed and/or granted and others of which we expect to be granted. Specifically, in most cases where we hold a US issued patent, the subject matter is covered at least by an application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which is then used or has been used to pursue protection in certain countries that are members of the treaty. Our patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Some of these patents may be eligible for patent term extensions, depending on their subject matter and length of time required to conduct clinical trials. Our material patents relate to fostamatinib, an oral SYK inhibitor, that is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in TAVALISSE, and olutasidenib, an oral mIDH1 inhibitor that is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in REZLIDHIA. These patents will expire at various dates from 2026 to 2032 for fostamatinib and from 2035 to 2039 for olutasidenib. 
 Fostamatinib.  Fostamatinib is covered as a composition of matter in a US issued patent that has an expected expiration date of September 2031, after taking into account a patent term adjustment and extension rules. Additional patents covering fostamatinib composition of matter, methods for use, formulations, methods for making and intermediates expire at various dates from 2023 to 2041. Corresponding applications have been filed in foreign jurisdictions under the PCT, and are at various stages of prosecution. Of note, a patent covering fostamatinib as a composition of matter and in compositions for use treating various diseases has been granted by the European Patent Office.
Olutasidenib. Olutasidenib is covered as a composition of matter in a US issued patent that has an expected expiration date of December 2036, after taking into account patent term extension rules. Additional patents covering olutasidenib compositions of matter, methods for use, solid forms, methods for making and intermediates expire at various dates from 2035 to 2042. Several corresponding applications have been filed in foreign jurisdictions under the PCT and are at various stages of prosecution.

Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Many of the drugs that we are attempting to discover will be competing with existing therapies. In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. 
​
We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic and research institutions and government agencies, both in the US and abroad. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions as our research programs. Our major competitors include fully integrated pharmaceutical companies that have extensive drug discovery efforts and are developing novel small molecule and biologics pharmaceuticals. We also face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing the same or similar technologies, including the discovery of targets that are useful in compound screening, as the technologies used by us in our drug discovery efforts.
Competition may also arise from:

● | new or better methods of target identification or validation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | generic version of our products or of products with which we compete;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | new small molecules; or
--+------------------------


● | other classes of therapeutic agents.
--+-------------------------------------

Our competitors or their collaborative partners may utilize discovery technologies and techniques or partner with collaborators in order to develop products more rapidly or successfully than we or our collaborators are able to do. Many of our competitors, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies and may establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
We believe that our ability to compete is dependent, in part, upon our ability to create, maintain and license scientifically advanced technology and upon our and our collaborators’ ability to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology. The failure by any of our collaborators or us, including our commercial team, in any of those areas may prevent the successful commercialization of our potential drug targets.
Many of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have significantly greater experience than we do in:

● | identifying and validating targets;
--+------------------------------------


● | screening compounds against targets; and
--+-----------------------------------------


● | undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, identifying or validating new targets or discovering new drug compounds before we do.

20



Our competitors might develop technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that are being developed by us or that would render our technology and product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. In addition, our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the FDA or other regulatory agencies for product candidates more rapidly. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including certain patent and FDA marketing exclusivity rights that would delay or prevent our ability to market certain products. Any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts with our existing or future collaborative partners, might not be able to compete successfully with competitors’ existing or future products or obtain regulatory approval in the US or elsewhere.
We face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for commercial and collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to additional technologies. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than ours.
Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

● | identify and validate targets;
--+-------------------------------


● | discover candidate drug compounds that interact with the targets we identify;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attract and retain scientific and product development personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our new drug compounds and technologies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enter commercialization agreements for our new drug compounds; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to obtain and maintain an appropriate reimbursement price and positive recommendations by HTA bodies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITP
​
There are existing therapies and drug candidates in development for the treatment of ITP that may be alternative therapies to TAVALISSE. Currently, corticosteroids remain the most common first line therapy for ITP, occasionally in conjunction with intravenous immuglobulin (IVIg) or anti-Rh(D) as added agents to help further augment platelet count recovery, particularly in emergency situations. However, it has been estimated that frontline agents lead to durable remissions in only a small percentage of newly-diagnosed adults with ITP. Moreover, concerns with steroid-related side effects often restrict therapy to approximately four weeks. As such, many patients progress to persistent or chronic ITP, requiring other forms of therapeutic intervention. 
The FDA can approve an ANDA for a generic version of a branded drug without the ANDA applicant undertaking the clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. In September 2019, the FDA published product-specific bioequivalence guidance on fostamatinib disodium to let potential ANDA applicants understand the data the FDA would expect to see for approval of a generic version of TAVALISSE. The earliest an ANDA may be filed by a generic company was April 17, 2022. The ANDA process can result in generic competition if the patents at issue are not upheld or if the generic competitor is found not to infringe our patents. 
Other approaches to treat ITP are varied in their mechanism of action, and there is no consensus about the sequence of their use. Options include splenectomy, TPO-Ras, and various immunosuppressants (such as rituximab). The response rate criteria of the above-mentioned options vary, precluding a comparison of response rates for individual therapies. According to the most recent ITP guideline from the ASH, there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations for various management approaches. In general, strategies that avoided medication side effects were favored. A large focus was placed on shared decision-making especially with regard to second-line therapy.
 ​
Even with the above treatment options, a significant number of patients remain severely thrombocytopenic for long durations and are subject to risk of spontaneous or trauma-induced hemorrhage. The addition of fostamatinib to the treatment options could be beneficial since it has a different mechanism of action than the TPO agonists. Fostamatinib is 

21



a potent and relatively selective SYK inhibitor, and its inhibition of Fc receptors and B-cell receptors signaling pathways make it a potentially broad immunomodulatory agent. 
Other products in the US that are approved by the FDA to increase platelet production through binding and TPO receptors on megakaryocyte precursors include PROMACTA (Novartis), Nplate (Amgen, Inc.) and DOPTELET (Dova Pharmaceuticals).
AML with IDH1 Mutation
There is currently one other product approved in the US for patients with IDH1 mutation. TIBSOVO (ivosidenib), an oral targeted IDH1 mutation inhibitor, is an FDA approved drug for (i) adult patients with R/R AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation, (ii) newly diagnosed AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation who are at least 75 years old or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy, (iii) for adult patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test, and (iv) in combination with azacitidine (azacitidine for injection), for newly diagnosed AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test in adults 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. TIBSOVO is a registered trademark of Servier Pharmaceuticals LLC, a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Les Laboratoires Servier. In addition, some clinicians may utilize non-targeted treatments for patients with mIDH1 R/R AML, including use of venetoclax combinations, hypomethylating agents, other chemotherapy regimens, or investigational agents that may be available to them.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the US, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, sampling, tracking and tracing, sales, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the US and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, such as those governing personal information and information security, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
Review and Approval of Drugs in the US 
In the US, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties. 
A drug product candidate must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application (NDA). An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the US must typically undertake the following: 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22




● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review by an FDA advisory committee, if requested by the FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and potentially post-market requirement, or PMR, and commitment, or PMC, studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved new drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. In support of the IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND before clinical trials may begin. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin or resume. An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

● | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which denote a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23




approve a drug. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, identify adverse effects, establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In most cases the FDA requires at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, such as where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
Review and Approval of Drugs in the EU and the UK
Similar rules governing clinical trials to those in place in the US apply in the European Union (EU) and the UK, with a clinical trial application (CTA) required to be submitted for each clinical trial to each EU Member State’s national competent authority (NCA) and an independent Ethics Committee. Following the UK’s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the end of the transition period that was in place until the end of 2020, clinical trials that take place in the UK will be seen by the EMA as trials that have taken place in a “third country” and will only be considered during the course of a marketing authorization application if they are carried out on a basis that is in line with the regulations governing clinical trials in the EU. As of January 31, 2022, clinical trials in the EU must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (CTR) that has amended the system of approval for clinical trials in the EU. Under the CTR as of January 31, 2023, sponsors must apply for authorizations through the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), the new clinical trials portal and database that allows a coordinated and streamlined application and authorization process for clinical trials and ethical approvals throughout the EU. The UK has not applied the CTR, and is currently revising its own clinical trials framework, and therefore its regulatory framework on clinical trials is not aligned with the EU CTR. This may result in trials that take place in the UK potentially carrying less weight when applying for a marketing authorization in the EU.
Review of an NDA by the FDA 
If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the drug development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA. The NDA is the vehicle through which drug applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for marketing and sale in the US for one or more indications. The NDA must contain a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods, as well as results of preclinical tests, toxicology studies, clinical trials and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 
Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is 

24



sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to goals to review and act within ten months from filing for standard review NDAs and within six months for NDAs that have been designated for “priority review”. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated by the drug, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. 
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA intends to review such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and submission to FDA of an sNDA, which may require FDA review and approval prior to implementation. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
Expedited approval pathways
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority Review designation. In addition, accelerated approval offers the potential for approval based on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint. In May 2014, the FDA published a final Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on the FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drug candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug candidate is a candidate for these 

25



expedited development and review programs.
The FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s review clock for a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
A product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross disciplinary project lead for the review team; rolling review; and, taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
FDA intends to review applications for standard review drug products within ten months of the 60-day filing date; and, applications for priority review drugs within six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines treat a serious condition, and if approved, would offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation.
Accelerated approval pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over available treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such drug for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the 

26



development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, all promotional materials for drugs approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA, EMA and MHRA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, EMA and MHRA and other national competent authorities in the EU including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, tracking and tracing, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to track and trace drug products, ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
Many jurisdictions, including the EU and the UK, require each marketing authorization holder, national competent authority and the EMA to operate a pharmacovigilance system to ensure that the safety of all medicines is monitored throughout their use. The overall EU pharmacovigilance system operates through cooperation between the EU Member States, EMA and the EC.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the US for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the application fee. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the name of the drug and its potential orphan-designated use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. 
In the EU and UK, under Regulation (EC)141/2000 and the UK Human Medicines Regulation 2012 (as amended), respectively, medicinal products may be granted an orphan drug designation if they are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU/ UK and for which there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment when the application is made, or when the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted to drugs used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives.
The application for orphan designation must be submitted to and approved by the EMA in respect of the EU or to the MHRA for Great Britain before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Medicinal products which benefit from orphan status, which they successfully maintain post-grant of the marketing authorization, can benefit from up to ten years of market exclusivity in respect of the approved indication. This prevents regulatory authorities in the EU or Great Britain, as the case may be, from granting marketing authorizations for similar medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication, unless another applicant can show that the similar medicinal product in question is safer, more effective or clinically superior to the orphan-designated product or if the marketing authorization holder consents to the second orphan medicinal product application, or where the marketing authorization holder cannot supply the needs of the market.
The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify the maintenance of market exclusivity. Conversely, the 10-year exclusivity period can be further extended by 2 years, when pediatric studies are conducted in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP) and in completion of all the legal requirements.
However, the general pharmaceutical legislative framework, as well as the framework applicable to orphan and pediatric medicinal products in the EU, is under review. The EC expects to publish its position on this in March 2023. Although the final proposals are not yet formally known, it is expected that there will be a reduction in applicable regulatory exclusivities which will significantly affect all medicinal products that will be authorized after the legislative changes have taken effect, including a reduction in the 10-year orphan market exclusivity, which will be modulated according to certain parameters.

Pediatric studies and exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (the FDASIA), sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data.
Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
In the EU and the UK, a six-month extension to a supplementary protection certificate may be granted, subject to certain circumstances, upon the completion of an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP). However, within the EU, regulatory protections afforded to medicinal products such as data exclusivity, marketing protection, market exclusivity for orphan indications and pediatric extensions are currently under review and could be curtailed in future years.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for generic drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme allowing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an ANDA to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD).
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. An applicant may submit an ANDA suitability petition to request the FDA’s prior permission to submit an abbreviated application for a drug that differs from the RLD in route of administration, dosage form, or strength, or for a drug that has one different active ingredient in a fixed combination drug product (i.e., a drug product with multiple active ingredients). At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not 

29



show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists may consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional bridging studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Hatch-Waxman patent certification and the 30-month stay
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Orange Book.
When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent, known as a Section VIII statement. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
Patent term extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory process. The allowable patent term extension is typically calculated as one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between NDA submission date and the NDA approval date up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of product 

30



approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. 
Exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments
In addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a particular drug until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity (NCE). For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years from the date the NDA is approved, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it does, however, block the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs during the period of exclusivity. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
FDA Emergency Use Authorization
Section 564 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3) allows the FDA to authorize the shipment of drugs, biological products (including vaccines), or medical devices that either lack required approval, licensure, or clearance (unapproved products), or are approved but are to be used for unapproved ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious diseases or conditions in the event of an emergency declaration by the HHS Secretary.
On February 4, 2020, then-HHS Secretary Alex M. Azar II determined that a public health emergency exists for COVID-19 and declared that it justifies the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for COVID-19, pursuant to Section 564 of the FDCA. On March 2, 2020, March 24, 2020, and March 27, 2020, Secretary Azar issued corresponding declarations for personal respiratory protective devices; for medical devices, including alternative products used as medical devices; and, for drugs and biological products. The determination and these declarations were published in the Federal Register on February 7, 2020, March 10, 2020, March 27, 2020, and April 1, 2020, respectively.
While the emergency determination and declaration are effective, the FDA may authorize the use of an unapproved product or an unapproved use of an approved product if it concludes that:


• | an agent referred to in the emergency declaration could cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it is reasonable to believe that the authorized product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing that disease or condition or a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by an approved product or a product marketed under an EUA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31




• | the known and potential benefits of the authorized product, when used for that disease or condition, outweigh known and potential risks, taking into consideration the material threat of agents identified in the emergency declaration;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the authorized product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the relevant disease or condition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any other criteria prescribed by the FDA is satisfied.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

Medical products that are granted an EUA are only permitted to commercialize their products under the terms and conditions provided in the authorization. The FDCA authorizes FDA to impose such conditions on an EUA as may be necessary to protect the public health. Consequently, postmarketing requirements will vary across EUAs. In addition, FDA has, on occasion, waived requirements for drugs marketed under an EUA. 
Generally, EUAs for unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products require that manufacturers distribute factsheets for healthcare providers, addressing significant known and potential benefits and risk, and the extent to which benefits and risks are unknown, and the fact that FDA has authorized emergency use; and, distribution of factsheets for recipients of the product, addressing significant known and potential benefits and risk, and the extent to which benefits and risks are unknown, the option to accept or refuse the product, the consequences of refusing, available alternatives, and the fact that FDA has authorized emergency use.
Generally, EUAs for unapproved products and, per FDA’s discretion, EUAs for unapproved uses of approved products, include requirements for adverse event monitoring and reporting, and other recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Note, however, that approved products are already subject to equivalent requirements.
In addition, FDA may include various requirements in an EUA as a matter of discretion as deemed necessary to protect the public health, including restrictions on which entities may distribute the product, and how to perform distribution (including requiring that distribution be limited to government entities), restrictions on who may administer the product, requirements for collection and analysis of safety and effectiveness data, waivers of cGMP, and restrictions applicable to prescription drugs or restricted devices (including advertising and promotion restrictions).
The FDA may revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, if the conditions for the issuance of the EUA are no longer met, or if other circumstances make revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.
It is difficult to predict when the determination and declaration will be revoked or ended, which will impact the marketing of products under existing EUAs and the availability of new EUAs based on the determination and declaration. For example, in January 2023, Congress proposed legislation that would end other COVID-19-related emergency declarations, if passed, and the White House has issued a statement that those declarations will end on May 11, 2023. FDA officials have stated that this will not impact FDA’s ability to authorize treatments for emergency use, such that existing EUAs will remain in effect and the agency may continue to issue new EUAs going forward when criteria for issuance are met. This is nonetheless subject to change.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
In the US and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Third-party payors include federal and state government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, managed care organizations, and other organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. For example, in the US, there have been several recent US Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. This includes the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which addressed 

32



several drug price reporting and transparency measures, such as a new requirement for prescription drug plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizations to develop tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time and for insurance companies and employer-based health plans to report information on pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and the Treasury. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which included among its provisions a sunset of the provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the Affordable Care Act) that capped pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). Under the Affordable Care Act, manufacturers’ rebate liability was capped at 100% of the average manufacturer price for a covered outpatient drug. Effective January 1, 2024, manufacturers’ MDRP rebate liability will no longer be capped, potentially resulting in a manufacturer paying more in MDRP rebates than it receives on the sale of certain covered outpatient drugs. In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which implements substantial changes to the Medicare program, including drug pricing reforms and changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design. Among other reforms, the IRA imposes inflation rebates on drug manufacturers for products reimbursed under Medicare Parts B and D if the prices of those products increase faster than inflation; implements changes to the Medicare Part D benefit that, beginning in 2025, will cap beneficiary annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000, while imposing new discount obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and, beginning in 2026, establishes a “maximum fair price” for a fixed number of pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D following a price negotiation process with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). On February 9, 2023, CMS issued guidance that further clarified the scope of the Medicare Part B and Part D inflationary rebates, including a detailed discussion of which Part B and Part D products are eligible for such rebates and how the rebates are calculated. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including limitations on reimbursement, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing, cost disclosure, including disclosures for certain price increases or launches of costly drugs, and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the product. It is likely that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s products or additional pricing pressure.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have an adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that adequate reimbursement will be approved at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments and third-party payors have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Increasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for medical products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

33



In the EU, pricing and reimbursement methods can differ in each Member State. Some Member States and the UK may require that health technology assessments (HTA) be completed to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The outcome of HTA assessments is decided on a national basis and some Member States may decide not to reimburse the use of medicines or may reduce the rate of reimbursement. In December 2021, the EU adopted a new Regulation on Health Technology Assessment which allows Member States to carry out joint clinical assessments and operate joint clinical consultations. It is expected that the new Regulation will come into effect in 2025.
Healthcare and Privacy Law and Regulation 
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, laws requiring reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and other healthcare providers, patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 


● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which is a criminal law that prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other, including, for example, consulting/speaking arrangements, discount and rebate offers, grants, charitable contributions, and patient support offerings, among others. A conviction for violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment and requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Exclusion may also be imposed if the government determines that an entity has committed acts that are prohibited by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;

● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, (i) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent; (ii) knowingly making, or using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; (iii) knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government; or (iv) knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Private individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” can bring FCA qui tam actions, on behalf of the government and may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. Pharmaceutical companies have been investigated and/or subject to government enforcement actions asserting liability under the FCA in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product.

from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Moreover, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations. Such per-claim penalties are currently set at $13,508 to $27,018 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after January 30, 2023, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015. Criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, are also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government;

Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;

While the vast majority of HIPAA obligations do not apply to pharmaceutical companies, the requirements inform privacy and security practices across the industry and may impact interactions with health care providers. Moerver, HITECH created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;

Some state, local and foreign laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and/or require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and transfers of value made to physicians and other health care providers or entities or marketing expenditures. In addition, there are state and local laws that require registration of sales representatives; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to drug pricing; data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the US (such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), which became effective in May 2018); federal and state laws governing the privacy and security of personal information (including health information) many of

which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
Healthcare Reform 
The US and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the US Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which included changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. This law was designed to expand access to health insurance coverage for uninsured and underinsured individuals while containing overall healthcare costs. There have been numerous judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal, or repeal and replace, all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Further, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 fully repealed the Affordable Care Act’s mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) amended the Affordable Care Act to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Under the IRA, this coverage gap will be eliminated beginning January 1, 2025. The IRA also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 10% of the negotiated price of brands, biologics, and biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the initial coverage phase, and 20% of the negotiated price during the catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D coverage. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On June 17, 2021, the US Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the law. It is unclear how future actions before the Supreme Court, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act.
​
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the US since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect into 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken (with the exception of a temporary suspension instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic that expired on July 1, 2022). To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, reductions in Medicare payments will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. The sequestration was temporarily halted from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022 as a result of various legislation, and later reduced to 1% from April 2022 to until July 1, 2022. In January

2013, former President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the US of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which among other changes, eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacture price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. The American Rescue Plan Act also temporarily increased premium tax credit assistance for individuals eligible for subsidies under the ACA for 2021 and 2022 and removed the 400% federal poverty level limit that otherwise applies for purposes of eligibility to receive premium tax credits. The IRA extended this increased tax credit assistance and removal of the 400% federal poverty limit through 2025. The Biden administration has also taken executive actions to address drug pricing and other healthcare policy changes. For example, in response to a July 9, 2021 Executive Order from President Biden that included several prescription drug initiatives, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that identified potential legislative policies and administrative tools that Congress and the agency can pursue in order to make drug prices more affordable and equitable, improve and promote competition throughout the prescription drug industry, and foster scientific innovation. Additionally, on September 12, 2022, President Biden issued an Executive Order to promote biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation. The Order noted several methods through which the Biden Administration would support the advancement of biotechnology and biomanufacturing in healthcare, and instructed the Department of Health and Human Service to submit, within 180 days of the Order, a report assessing how to use biotechnology and biomanufacturing to achieve medical breakthroughs, reduce the overall burden of disease, and improve health outcomes. In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which implements substantial changes to the Medicare program, including drug pricing reforms and changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design. Among other reforms, the IRA imposes inflation rebates on drug manufacturers for products reimbursed under Medicare Parts B and D if the prices of those products increase faster than inflation; implements changes to the Medicare Part D benefit that, beginning in 2025, will cap benefit annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000, while imposing new discount obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and, beginning in 2026, establishes a “maximum fair price” for a fixed number of pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D following a price negotiation process with CMS. On October 14, 2022 President Biden issued an Executive Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans, which instructed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to consider whether to select for testing by the CMS Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Executive Order further directed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to submit, within 90 days after the date of the Executive Order, a report regarding any models that may lead to lower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and support value-based payment that promotes high-quality care. On February 14, 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report in response to the October 14, 2022, Executive Order, which, among other things, selects three potential drug affordability and accessibility models to be tested by the CMS Innovation Center. Specifically, the report addresses: (1) a model that would allow Part D Sponsors to establish a “high-value drug list” setting the maximum co-payment amount for certain common generic drugs at $2; (2) a Medicaid-focused model that would establish a partnership between CMS, manufacturers, and state Medicaid agencies that would result in multi-state outcomes-based agreements for certain cell and gene therapy drugs; and (3) a model that would adjust Medicare Part B payment amounts for Accelerated Approval Program drugs to advance the developments of novel treatments. It remains to be seen how these drug pricing initiatives will affect the broader pharmaceutical industry. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Policy changes, including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the ACA or the implementation of new health care legislation, could result in significant changes to the health care system, which may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be 

37



adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for our product candidates, or additional pricing pressures.
Outside the US, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
We currently do not have the manufacturing capabilities or experience necessary to produce our products or any product candidates for clinical trials. We currently use one active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer and one finished goods manufacturer for each of our products. We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of our product for commercial use or for preclinical and clinical trials. We assign internal personnel to manage and oversee third parties working on our behalf under contract. These third parties manufacture raw materials, the active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product for commercial distribution and for use in clinical studies. We currently rely on and will continue to rely on these third-party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our products. 


Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we have 155 full-time employees. Of these employees, 84 were engaged in commercial activities, 40 were engaged in research and development activities, and 31 were engaged in general and administrative activities. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. In November 2021, we announced our plan to exit early-stage research and focus resources on our mid to late-stage development programs and commercial efforts which resulted in elimination of positions primarily in research organization. In October 2022, we announced a reduction in our workforce primarily in our development and administration groups.
​
None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining arrangement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We aim to provide a stimulating and rewarding work environment, with recognition for accomplishments and the opportunity to advance our employees’ careers while sharing in the excitement of our growth and success. We know that our success depends on the experience, intellect, and talent of our highly motivated team, and we truly value the people who make our organization great. We provide a collaborative work environment that is both personally fulfilling and enables our employees to work together to achieve the purpose and goals of the organization. Our human capital efforts focus on maintaining a sufficient number of skilled employees in each respective department. Recruiting and retaining experienced and qualified sales and marketing personnel to successfully commercialize our product and scientific personnel to continue to perform research and development work in the future will be critical to our business success. Our ability to recruit, develop and retain highly skilled talent is a significant determinant of our success. To facilitate talent attraction, retention, and development, we strive to be an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, opportunities for equity ownership, development opportunities that enable continued learning and growth and employment packages that promote well-being across all aspects of our employees’ lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off.

The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested and intend to continue to do. We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Additionally, we offer programs to help support employees physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status, encourage engagement in healthy behaviors, and offer choices where possible so they are customized to meet their needs. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have undertaken and plan to continue to undertake, safety measures to keep our employees’ health, safety, and wellness a priority. We implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. We endeavor to provide the safest and most effective work environment under the circumstances, but we cannot guarantee that employees who come to the office will not be exposed to COVID-19 while at the office. It will be the responsibility of all employees to participate and cooperate in safety and cleaning protocols. We expect all employees, contractors, and visitors to our facility to comply with our COVID-19 guidelines plan. 
We provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base compensation, these programs include annual bonuses, Stock Award Plans, Employee Stock Purchase Plans, 401(k), healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, health and fitness benefits and various additional employee programs. We have robust annual performance review processes for reviewing employees’ performance and pay. 
Scientific and Medical Advisors
We utilize scientists, key opinion leaders and physicians to advise us on scientific and medical matters as part of our ongoing commercialization activities and research and product development efforts, including experts in clinical trial design, preclinical development work, chemistry, biology, immunology, oncology and immuno-oncology. Certain of our consultants receive non-employee options to purchase our common stock and certain of our scientific and medical advisors receive honorarium for time spent assisting us.
