ITEM 1. Business
The Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in four business segments: Media Networks; Parks, Experiences and Products; Studio Entertainment; and Direct-to-Consumer & International (DTCI).
For convenience, the terms “Company”, “we” and “our” are used to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted.
The Company employed approximately 223,000 people as of September 28, 2019.
On March 20, 2019, the Company acquired the outstanding capital stock of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., which was subsequently renamed TFCF Corporation, a diversified global media and entertainment company. Prior to the acquisition, TFCF and a newly-formed subsidiary of TFCF (New Fox) entered into a separation agreement, pursuant to which TFCF transferred to New Fox a portfolio of TFCF’s news, sports and broadcast businesses and certain other assets. TFCF retained all of the assets and liabilities not transferred to New Fox, the most significant of which were the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios, certain cable networks (primarily FX and National Geographic), TFCF’s international television businesses (including Star) and TFCF’s 30% interest in Hulu LLC (Hulu). Under the terms of the agreement governing the acquisition, the Company will generally phase-out Fox brands by 2024, but has perpetual rights to certain Fox brands, including the Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Searchlight brands.
As a result of the acquisition, the Company’s ownership interest in Hulu increased to 60%, and the Company started consolidating the results of Hulu as of the acquisition date. In May 2019, the Company increased its ownership interest in Hulu to 67%, with NBC Universal (NBCU) owning the remaining 33%. Also in May 2019, the Company entered into a put/call agreement with NBCU that provided the Company with full operational control of Hulu. In order to obtain regulatory approval for the acquisition of TFCF, the Company agreed to sell TFCF’s regional sports networks (RSN) and sports media operations in Brazil and Mexico. The sale of the RSNs was completed in August 2019. 
See Notes 4, 12 and 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the TFCF, Hulu and RSNs transactions.
In November 2019, the Company launched Disney+, a subscription based direct-to-consumer video streaming service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming. The service was launched in the U.S. and four other countries, with further launches in other countries planned throughout 2020 and 2021.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Domestic Cable Networks
Our domestic cable networks produce their own programs and also acquire programming rights from our television and theatrical production operations and third parties. The majority of the domestic cable networks’ revenue is derived from affiliate fees and advertising sales. Generally, the Company’s cable networks provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs that include contractually specified rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge to MVPDs for our cable network programming is largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand. We also sell programs developed by our cable networks worldwide to television broadcasters, to subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services (such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon) and in home entertainment formats (such as DVD, Blu-ray and electronic home video license). In fiscal 2020, we expect a significant portion of our programs to be licensed to DTCI.

ABC produces its own programs and also acquires programming rights from third parties as well as entities that are owned by or affiliated with the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Competition and Seasonality
The Company’s Media Networks businesses compete for viewers primarily with other broadcast and cable networks, independent television stations and other media, such as online video services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks and radio stations, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.
The Company’s Media Networks businesses face competition from other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company’s contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.
The Company’s Media Networks businesses also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies, SVOD providers and direct-to-consumer services for the acquisition of sports rights, talent, show concepts, scripted and other programming, and exhibition outlets.
The Company’s internet websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.
Advertising revenues at Media Networks are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate fees are generally collected ratably throughout the year.
Federal Regulation
Television and radio broadcasting are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under federal laws and regulations, including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. FCC regulations that affect our Media Networks segment include the following:

• | Licensing of television and radio stations. Each of the television and radio stations we own must be licensed by the FCC. These licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. We (and the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain FCC approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. The FCC may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances and may delay renewals while permitting a licensee to continue operating. Although we have received such renewals and approvals in the past or have been permitted to continue operations when renewal is delayed, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future.


• | Television and radio station ownership limits. The FCC imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations we can own in a specific market, on the combined number of television and radio stations we can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations we own. Currently:


▪ | FCC regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. We do not own more than one television station in any market.


▪ | Federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience. Pursuant to the most recent decision by the FCC as to how to calculate compliance with this limit, our eight stations reach approximately 20% of the national audience.


▪ | FCC regulations in some cases impose restrictions on our ability to acquire additional radio or television stations in the markets in which we own radio stations. We do not believe any such limitations are material to our current operating plans.


• | Dual networks. FCC rules currently prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC — from being under common ownership or control.


• | Regulation of programming. The FCC regulates broadcast programming by, among other things, banning “indecent” programming, regulating political advertising and imposing commercial time limits during children’s programming. Penalties for broadcasting indecent programming can be over $400 thousand per indecent utterance or image per station.

Federal legislation and FCC rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. In addition, broadcast channels are 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

generally required to provide an average of three hours per week of programming that has as a “significant purpose” meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance.

• | Cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations. With respect to cable systems operating within a television station’s Designated Market Area, FCC rules require that every three years each television station elect either “must carry” status, pursuant to which cable operators generally must carry a local television station in the station’s market, or “retransmission consent” status, pursuant to which the cable operator must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. Under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and its successors, including most recently the STELA Reauthorization Act (STELAR), which also requires the “must carry” or “retransmission consent” election, satellite carriers are permitted to retransmit a local television station’s signal into its local market with the consent of the local television station. The ABC owned television stations have historically elected retransmission consent. Portions of these satellite laws are set to expire on December 31, 2019.


• | Cable and satellite carriage of programming. The Communications Act and FCC rules regulate some aspects of negotiations regarding cable and satellite retransmission consent, and some cable and satellite companies have sought regulation of additional aspects of the carriage of programming on cable and satellite systems. New legislation, court action or regulation in this area could have an impact on the Company’s operations.

The foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, other legislation and specific FCC rules and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, other legislation, FCC rules and public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of the FCC’s regulatory authority.
FCC laws and regulations are subject to change, and the Company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.

electronics.

Competition and Seasonality
The Company’s theme parks and resorts as well as Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club compete with other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. The profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, the political environment, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, weather patterns and natural disasters. The licensing and retail business compete with other licensors, retailers and publishers of character, brand and celebrity names, as well as other licensors, publishers and developers of game software, online video content, internet websites, other types of home entertainment and retailers of toys and kids merchandise.
All of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. Typically, theme park attendance and resort occupancy fluctuate based on the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods. The licensing, specialty retail, and wholesale businesses are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases, and cable programming broadcasts.

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Marvel in fiscal 2010, Marvel had licensed Spider-Man rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony). Sony incurs the costs to produce and distribute Spider-Man films, and the Company licenses the merchandise rights to third parties. The Company pays Sony a licensing fee based on each film’s box office receipts, subject to specified limits. The Company distributes all other Marvel-produced films with the exception of The Incredible Hulk, which is distributed by Universal Pictures.
Theatrical Market
We produce and distribute full-length live-action films and animated films. In the domestic theatrical market, we generally distribute and market our filmed products directly. In most major international markets, we distribute our filmed products directly while in other markets our films are distributed by independent companies or joint ventures. During fiscal 2020, we expect to release approximately 25 of our own produced feature films. Cumulatively through September 28, 2019 the Company has released approximately 1,000 full-length live-action features and 100 full-length animated features.
The Company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the public’s intent to view the film and to help generate consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary markets. These costs are expensed as incurred, which may result in a loss on a film in the theatrical markets, including in periods prior to the theatrical release of the film.
Home Entertainment Market
In the domestic market, we distribute home entertainment releases directly under each of our motion picture banners. In international markets, we distribute home entertainment releases under our motion picture banners both directly and through independent distribution companies.
Domestic and international home entertainment distribution typically starts three to six months after the theatrical release in each market. Home entertainment releases are distributed in physical (DVD and Blu-ray) and electronic formats. Electronic formats may be released up to four weeks ahead of the physical release. Physical formats are generally sold to retailers, such as Walmart and Target and electronic formats are sold through e-tailers, such as Apple and Amazon.
As of September 28, 2019, we have approximately 2,400 active produced and acquired film titles, including 2,200 live-action titles and 200 animated titles, in the domestic home entertainment marketplace and approximately 2,300 active produced and acquired titles, including 2,000 live-action titles and 300 animated titles, in the international marketplace.
Concurrently with physical home entertainment distribution, we license titles to video-on-demand service providers for electronic delivery to consumers for a specified rental period.
Television Market
In the television market, we license our films to cable and broadcast networks, television stations and other video service providers, which may provide the content to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices. The television market is comprised of multiple pay TV and free TV windows, which can have license periods of various lengths following the home entertainment window. In fiscal 2020, our Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar branded films will generally be licensed to DTCI for use on Disney+ after the theatrical and home entertainment windows.
With the acquisition of TFCF, the Company’s library of film titles available for distribution increased by approximately 2,000.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Disney Theatrical Group also licenses the Company’s intellectual property to Feld Entertainment, the producer of Disney On Ice and Marvel Universe Live!.
Competition and Seasonality
The Studio Entertainment businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television films, exploit products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD programming services, produce music and sponsor live theater. We also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties and advertiser support that are essential to the success of our Studio Entertainment businesses.
The success of Studio Entertainment operations is heavily dependent upon public taste and preferences. In addition, Studio Entertainment operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.

International Channels
Our International Channels produce local programs or acquire rights from our domestic studios and from third parties. Our International Channels derive the majority of their revenues from advertising sales and affiliate fees. Generally, channels provide programming under multi-year agreements with MVPDs that include contractually determined rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge to MVPDs for our channels are largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that a channel can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand.

Competition and Seasonality
The Company’s DTC and International Channel businesses compete for viewers primarily with other television and cable networks, television stations and other media, such as online video services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines and billboards.
The Company’s International Channels face competition from other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company’s contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for distribution that are as favorable as those currently in place.
The Company’s DTC and International Channels also compete with other media and entertainment companies, SVOD providers and DTC services for the acquisition of sports rights, talent, show concepts, and scripted and other programming. 
Internet websites and digital products operated by the segment compete with other websites and entertainment products. 
Revenues fluctuate based on the timing of releases and performance of our digital media content, viewership levels on our cable channels and digital platforms, changes in subscriber levels and the demand for sports and other content. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Intersegment content transactions are presented “gross” (i.e. the segment producing the content reports revenue and profit from intersegment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on a separate “Eliminations” line when presenting a summary of our segment results). Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, except that intersegment sales of library content are generally recognized over time.

• | Hulu licenses content from the Company’s television studios through various arrangements including fixed and variable licensing fees and a percentage of addressable ad sales. Hulu also licenses the linear stream of our broadcast and cable channels.
