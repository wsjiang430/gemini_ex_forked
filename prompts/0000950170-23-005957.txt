 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 GENERAL
 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, “The Hackett Group,” “Hackett,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to The Hackett Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries and predecessors. We were originally incorporated on April 23, 1997.
 
 The Hackett Group is an intellectual property-based executive advisory, IP as-a-Service Revenue ("IPaaS"), market intelligence, digital transformation consultancy and leading enterprise benchmarking and best practices implementation firm serving global companies. Services include benchmarking, executive advisory, IPaaS, market intelligence, business transformation and cloud enterprise application implementation. The Hackett Group also provides dedicated expertise in business strategy, operations, finance, human capital management, strategic sourcing, procurement, and information technology, including its highly recognized Oracle, SAP, OneStream and Coupa implementation offerings.
 
 The Hackett Group has completed over 25,000 benchmarking and performance studies with major organizations, including 97% of the Dow Jones Industrials, 93% of the Fortune 100, 73% of the DAX 30 and 52% of the FTSE 100. These studies drive our Digital Transformation Platform (“DTP” or “Hackett DTP”) which includes the firm's benchmarking metrics, best practices repository, and best practice configuration and process flow accelerators, which enables our clients and partners to achieve digital world-class performance.
 
 The rapid development and move to cloud applications and infrastructure along with improving analytics, mobile functionality and enhanced user experience is dramatically influencing the way businesses compete and deliver their services. This was further accelerated by the necessity to work remotely as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is redefining entire industries at an accelerated pace, forcing organizations to fundamentally change and adopt new capabilities in order to remain competitive. Traditional sequential and linear-based business models are changing to fully networked and dynamic automated workflows and events with enhanced analytics. This digital transformation era is very attractive to our sector since we believe our clients will increasingly require organizational and technology market intelligence and implementation insight on how to digitize their businesses and what changes in business models are required to justify significant investments.

 We have repositioned all of our offerings to the emerging digital transformation opportunities which started by digitizing all of our benchmarking and best practices intellectual property (“IP”). We wanted to deliver our proprietary insights in new ways and to do so efficiently and whenever possible, virtually. This also required us to change the way we go to market and engage clients, as well as added software implementation and market intelligence offerings and partners. For example, we have:

•Launched Quantum Leap® (“QL”) – Our next generation benchmarking and continuous improvement software as a service solution. This market leading benchmark solution allows us to improve the client experience by delivering twice the insight and reducing the client effort by half, thus redefining our benchmarking leadership. It covers over 100 enterprise process areas, across 20 industry groups on an end-to-end, functional or individual process basis.
 •Launched the Hackett DTP – We have digitized our IP and changed the way we share and deliver our IP with our clients across our benchmarking, executive advisory, IPaaS, market intelligence, business transformation and cloud enterprise application solutions. The Hackett DTP accelerates the speed to value realization by helping organizations achieve their performance targets through a combination of benchmark metrics, best practices and software configuration and process flow accelerators delivered in a fully automated platform. 
 •Launched in early 2023 our new Hackett Connect platform that will support all of our Executive and Market Intelligence offerings including our syndicated research channel relationships.
 •Expanded our IPaaS – leveraging our QL and DTP platforms we are attracting new alliance partners that can leverage our unique enterprise performance benchmarking and best practices solutioning IP to help them differentiate and sell their software or services solutions. This is a critical component of our desire to emphasize the growth of high margin annualized recurring revenues.
 •Expanded executive research advisory and market intelligence programs and dedicated sales expertise to grow high margin annualized recurring revenues. These relationships are also currently responsible for over 40% of the downstream Hackett’s business transformation and technology consulting revenues.


•Expanded Cloud Capabilities - We expanded our Oracle Cloud applications addressable market from Enterprise Performance Management (“EPM”) to include Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) and the entire Oracle Cloud applications suite through the acquisition of Jibe Consulting in 2017. This move quadrupled our Oracle Cloud addressable market and positioned us as a strategic Oracle Cloud applications consultancy. We have also expanded our alliance partners to include Coupa and Ariba in Procurement, as well as OneStream in EPM and Corporate Performance Management (“CPM”). In regard to SAP, we were an early provider of S4 HANA which allowed us to quickly transition our implementation skills and benefit from the SAP migration to the Cloud.
 •Expanded Smart Automation Capabilities – We expanded our ability to help clients assess and implement the rapidly emerging Workflow Automation, Process Mining and related smart automation technologies.
 •Launched the Hackett Institute and acquired the joint venture interest of our Certified Global Business Services (“CGBS”) Program – and moved our training content to a state-of-the-art learning management platform.
 
 We continue to expect one of the key drivers for our growth to come from the growing leverage of our “wedge” or IP-as-a-Service offerings, which includes our Benchmarking, Executive Advisory and market intelligence, and our IP led offerings which are enabled by our QL and DTP platforms.

OUR IP ENABLED QUANTUM LEAP, DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND HACKETT CONNECT PLATFORMS

 Our Quantum Leap, DTP, and Hackett Connect platforms resulted in a new way to share and leverage our IP across our offerings. This required us to digitize our intellectual capital and the way we share it with our clients across our benchmarking, executive research advisory, business transformation and Cloud Enterprise application implementation solutions. Our ability to fully digitize our IP and align proven technology and organizational solutions to help clients drive transformational change allows us to highly differentiate our offerings. It also allows us to engage and support clients more efficiently, remotely, and where appropriate, continuously.
 
 Hackett uses its proprietary benchmarking enterprise performance metrics and best practices repository intellectual capital to help clients accelerate the value realization from technology investments. Our benchmark offerings allow our clients to empirically quantify their performance improvement opportunity at an actionable level. It also provides us visibility into how leading global companies deploy technology or organizational strategies to optimize their performance. This insight results in a proprietary Best Practices Repository, as well as, best practice software configurations, process flows and organizational strategies. Utilizing the benchmarking metrics and repository of best practices, combined with the global strategy and implementation insight of our transformation and technology associates, Hackett has also created a series of organizational and technology accelerators that allow our clients to effect proven sustainable performance improvements.
 
 Our Hackett DTP leverages our inventory of Hackett-Certified best practices, observed through benchmark and other business transformation engagements, which correlate best practices with superior performance levels. We utilize Capability Maturity Models to better understand our clients’ capabilities and organizational maturity so that we can determine the level of performance that they can realistically pursue. In addition, we utilize Hackett’s intellectual capital in the form of best practice process flows and software configuration guides to integrate Hackett’s empirically proven best practices directly into business processes and workflows that are enabled by enterprise software applications. The repository of best practice processes and software configuration guides now reside in the new releases of our DTP. This allows us to utilize our IP on client engagements to ensure that best practices are identified and implemented, whenever possible. This coordinated approach addresses people, processes, information, and technology, all within the framework of our Hackett-Certified best practices.
 
 Because our solutions are based on Hackett-Certified best practices, we believe that clients gain significant advantages. Clients can have confidence that their solutions are based on strategies from the world’s leading companies. More importantly, Hackett’s solutions deliver enhanced efficiency, improved effectiveness, reduced implementation risk and accelerated and optimized value realization.
 
 Leveraging our Quantum Leap and Hackett Digital Transformation Platforms, and soon to launch Hackett Connect, our engagements often begin with an assessment of a client’s performance, which is normally gained through benchmarking key processes and comparing the results to world-class levels and industry standards captured in the Hackett performance metrics database. We then help clients prioritize and select the appropriate best practices to implement through a coordinated workflow automation and organizational design improvement strategy. Without a coordinated strategy that addresses the seven key business components which include organization and governance, process design, process sourcing, service placement, information, enabling technology and skills and talent, we believe companies risk losing a significant portion of business case benefits with their investments. We have designed detailed best practice process flows based on Hackett’s deep knowledge of world-class business performance. This enables clients to

streamline and automate key processes and generate performance improvements quickly and efficiently at both the functional and enterprise levels.
 
 Similarly, we integrate Hackett-Certified best practices directly into technology solutions. We believe it is imperative that companies simplify and automate workflows and processes to meet best practice standards before new technology implementations and upgrades are completed. The automation of inefficient processes only serves to continue to drive up costs, cycle times and error rates. We have completed detailed fit-gap analyses in most functional areas of major business application packages including Oracle, SAP and other leading enterprise applications to determine their ability to support best practices. Application-specific tools, implementation guides and process flows allow us to optimize the configuration of enterprise software applications. Hackett DTP enables the foundation for improved performance.
 
 We believe the combination of market intelligence, optimized processes and workflows, best practice-based business applications and enhanced business analytics environments allows our clients to achieve and sustain significant business performance improvement. The specific client circumstances normally dictate how they engage us. Our goal is to be responsive to client needs, and to establish a continuous and trusted relationship. We have developed a series of offerings that allow us to efficiently help our clients without regard to where they are in their respective performance improvement lifecycle.
 
COMPETITION
 
 The strategic executive advisory and technology consulting marketplace continues to be extremely competitive. The marketplace will remain competitive as companies continue to look for ways to improve their organizational effectiveness. Our competitors include leading research advisories, international accounting firms; international, national and regional strategic consulting and systems implementation firms; and the IT services divisions of application software firms. Mergers and acquisitions throughout our industry have resulted in higher levels of competition. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industries in which we compete include: skills and capabilities of people, innovative services and product offerings, perceived ability to add value, reputation and client references, price, scope of services, service delivery approaches, technical and industry expertise, quality of services and solutions, ability to deliver results on a timely basis, availability of appropriate resources, and global reach and scale. We acknowledge that many of our competitors are larger, however we believe very few, if any, of our competitors have proprietary intellectual capital similar to the benchmarking-based performance metrics QL delivers and the insight within the Hackett DTP that supports our Transformational Benchmark, Best Practices Advisory and Business Transformation and Technology offerings.
 Despite our size relative to our competitor group, we believe our competitive position is distinct. With Hackett’s best practice intellectual capital and our QL and DTP platforms, we believe we can empirically and digitally assist our clients. Our ability to apply best practices and benchmarking metrics to client operations via proven techniques is at the core of our competitive standing.
 Similarly, we believe that Hackett is the definitive source for best practice performance metrics and strategies. Hackett has conducted over 25,000 benchmark and performance studies over 29 years at over 8,800 clients, generating proprietary data sets spanning multiple performance metrics and correlating best practices with superior performance. The combination of Hackett benchmark data, along with deep expertise and knowledge in evaluating, designing and implementing business transformation strategies leveraging our proprietary Best Practices Repository and other accelerators within DTP, delivers a powerful and distinct value proposition to our clients.
 
 Our culture of client collaboration leverages the power of our cross-functional and service line teams to increase revenue and strengthen relationships. We believe that this culture, along with terrific talent and with our intellectual capital-centric approach, gives us a distinct competitive advantage.
 
STRATEGY
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the way we sell and deliver our services, as we quickly and successfully transitioned to a virtual and remote delivery model. Our efforts in the last few years to fully digitize our IP and go to market through our QL and DTP platforms proved to be critical to our success.
 
 Correspondingly, we remain focused on executing the following strategies:
 •Expanding our IP, brand market permission to our offerings. We believe that our long-term growth prospects depend on our ability to extend our unique objective and actionable value realization market permission to help our clients and strategic partners leverage our IP and proprietary platforms to define and enable our clients to achieve digital world class performance. Our new platforms allow us to deliver objective and actionable insight and expertise in an efficient and continuous way. 
 •Continue to position and grow Hackett as an IP-centric strategic advisory organization. We believe that the Hackett brand is widely recognized for its benchmarking metrics and best practice strategies. By building a series of highly 


complementary market intelligence and implementation offerings that allow our clients access to our IP, which is based on our performance metrics, best practice process and technology value realization insight, we are able to build trusted strategic relationships with our clients. Depending upon where our clients are in their assessment or implementation of performance improvement initiatives, we provide them a combination of actionable offerings that support their efforts.

 We believe that clients that leverage our IP are more likely to allow us to serve them more broadly. IP-based services enhance our opportunities to serve clients remotely, continuously and more profitably. Our goal is to expand and accelerate the growth of our IPaaS, executive advisory and market intelligence offerings to establish strategic relationships with our clients directly or through strategic alliances and syndicated channels and to further use that entry point to introduce our business transformation and technology consulting capabilities.
 
 The launch of QL, DTP and Hackett Connect should expand and attract new clients and alliance partners that can leverage our unique benchmarking and best practices, software configuration and process flow IP to help them differentiate and sell their software or services solutions.

 If our clients need access to our IP and advisors to help them either assess or execute transformation initiatives on their own, they can avail themselves of our Executive Advisory and Market Intelligence Programs or our new IPaaS offerings. The key is for our clients to know that we can support them strategically by leveraging our unique IP and insights so that we are able to build a strategic relationship which is appropriate for them. We also believe that our clients that value our IP will turn to us for other services when the need arises, allowing us over time to ascribe a larger amount of our total revenue to our existing client base, which will also improve the predictability of our results. We continue to explore ways to leverage our IP through new external strategic partners and channels.
•Introduce New IP-as-a-Service Offerings. We are now seeing new opportunities through new strategic alliances and channels to use our IP, research and brand to help others sell and deliver their offerings. We have signed several multi-year relationships and continue to pursue and launch pilots with major software and services providers. 
 •Continue to expand our QL/DTP Content and Technology. DTP incorporates Hackett's intellectual capital into our implementation tools and techniques. For our clients, the end results are tangible cost, performance gains and improved returns on their organizational and technology investments. Many clients attribute their decision to employ us to our IP and accelerators. Our objective is to help our clients make smarter business process and software configuration decisions as a result of our methods and knowledge. We are continuously updating our content and tools through benchmarking, enterprise transformation and research activities. Additional updates are also driven by new software releases that drive innovation in business process automation. We continue to invest in the digitization and integration of our various metrics, best practices and best practice acceleration tools into our QL and DTP platforms. 
 •Recruit and develop talent. As we continue to grow and realize the potential of our business model, it is important to attract, retain, develop and motivate associates. We continue to invest in associate development programs that are specifically targeted to improve our go-to-market and delivery execution.
 •Leverage our offshore capabilities. Leveraging an offshore resource capability to support the delivery of our offerings has been a key strategy for our organization. Our facilities in Hyderabad, India and Montevideo, Uruguay allow us to increase operational efficiencies and build targeted key capabilities that can appropriately support the delivery of our offerings and internal functional teams. We continue to see our offshore capabilities increase as a percentage of our total delivery resources. This increase has resulted in improved margins and competitiveness.
 •Seek out strategic acquisitions. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that strengthen our ability to compete and expand our IP. We believe that our unique Hackett access and our QL/DTP approach, coupled with our strong balance sheet and infrastructure, can be utilized to support a larger organization. We plan to pursue acquisitions that are accretive or have strong growth prospects, and most importantly, have strong synergies with our best practice intellectual capital leverage and focus.

 •Benchmarking Services
 
 Our benchmarking group has measured and evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of enterprise functions for over 8,800 organizations globally. This includes 97% of the Dow Jones Industrials, 93% of the Fortune 100, 73% of the DAX 30 and 52% of the FTSE 100. Ongoing studies are conducted in a wide range of areas, including selling, general and administrative, finance, human resources, information technology, procurement, enterprise performance management and shared services. Hackett has identified approximately 2,000 best practices for over 140 processes in these key functional areas and uses proprietary performance measurement tools and data collection processes that enable companies to complete the performance measurement cycle and identify and quantify improvement opportunities in as little as four weeks. Benchmarks are used by our clients to objectively establish priorities, generate organizational consensus, align compensation to establish performance goals and develop the required business case for business and technology investments.
 •Business Transformation Group 
 
 Our Business Transformation group help our clients develop a coordinated digital transformation strategy that allows our clients to achieve meaningful performance improvements across the enterprise. Our experienced teams utilize the Hackett performance measurement data to link performance gains to industry best practices. Our strategic capabilities include operational assessments, process and organization design, change management and the effective application of technology. We combine best practices knowledge with business expertise and broad technology capabilities, which we believe enables our programs to optimize return on client investments in people, process, technology and information. We also maintain our award winning procurement (Coupa and Ariba) functionally led groups and our OneStream CPM teams within this group.
 ORACLE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT
 
 Our Oracle Solutions Segment helps clients choose and deploy Oracle applications that best meet their needs and objectives. In 2017, we acquired Oracle ERP and Cloud implementation capabilities. This allowed us to greatly increase the size of our Oracle addressable market and strongly positioned us to be a strategic provider of Oracle’s rapidly growing cloud software and services market. The software market is rapidly moving to cloud-based software, which led us to aggressively transition our Oracle Solutions segment from being primarily focused on the implementation of Oracle EPM on-premise software to the entire Oracle Cloud Enterprise Suite. We believe the actions we took to expand our Oracle Cloud capabilities from EPM on-premise to the entire Oracle Cloud ERP Suite have strongly positioned us to take advantage of this secular cloud migration growth opportunity. Another significant investment we made was to digitize all of our IP and to build our proprietary Hackett DTP. By specifically building one of our first versions around the Oracle Cloud application functionality, we believe we can quickly demonstrate how to optimize the configuration of Oracle Cloud applications to drive to its fully intended transformative outcome. We believe these moves align our Oracle Solutions segment with the Oracle go-to-market strategy and will also allow us to use our unique best-practice implementation IP to demonstrate the value of Oracle Cloud apps for the Oracle sales channel. These improvements cover many aspects of service delivery, including process improvement, technology deployment, organizational alignment, information and data definition and skills and competency alignment. Solutions typically reside in three primary areas: Core Financial Close and Consolidation, Integrated Business Planning, and Reporting / Advanced Analytics. Solution innovations have taken the group into areas such as big data, cloud technology data management and governance, and industry-specific analytic templates.
SAP SOLUTIONS SEGMENT
 
 Our SAP Solutions segment helps clients choose and deploy S4 HANA Cloud applications that best meet their needs and objectives. Our expertise is focused on SAP ERP, with primary focus on Life Sciences and Consumer Goods. The group offers comprehensive services from planning, architecture, and vendor evaluation and selection through implementation, customization, testing and integration. Comprehensive fit-gap analyses of all major packages against Hackett Best Practices are utilized by our SAP Solutions teams. Our tools and templates help integrate best practices into business and analytical applications. The group also offers post-implementation support, change management, exception management, process transparency, system documentation and end-user training, all of which are designed to enhance return on investment. We also provide off-shore application development and Application Maintenance and Support (“AMS”) services. These services include post-implementation support for select business application and infrastructure platforms. Our SAP Solutions group also includes a division responsible for the sale of the SAP suite of applications.
CLIENTS
 
 We focus on developing long-term client relationships with Global 2000 firms and other sophisticated buyers of business and IT consulting services. During 2022, our ten most significant clients accounted for 24% of total revenue and during 2021 and 2020, our ten most significant clients accounted for 22% of total revenue in each year. In addition, during 2022, 2021 and 2020, our largest client generated 7%, 4% and 5% of total revenue, respectively. We have achieved a high level of satisfaction across our client base. We receive surveys from a significant number of our engagements which are utilized in a rigorous process to improve our delivery execution, sales processes, methodologies and training.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING
 
 Our extensive client base and relationships with Global 2000 firms remain our most significant sources of new business. Our revenue generation strategy is formulated to ensure that we are addressing multiple facets of business development. Our primary goal is to continue to increase awareness of our brand which we have created around our Hackett empirical knowledge capital in the extended enterprise that we now serve. We have a regional sales and market development effort in both North America and Europe, so we can better coordinate the sales and marketing messages from our various offerings. Our compensation programs for our associates reflect an emphasis on optimizing our total revenue relationship with our clients. In our technology groups, we have continued to utilize our Hackett intellectual capital as a way to differentiate the relationships we have with the software providers and with our clients. The categories below define our business development resources.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
 
 Although virtually all of our advisors and consultants are expected to contribute to new revenue opportunities, our primary internal business development resources are comprised of the following:
 •The Leadership Team, Principals and Senior Directors are comprised of our senior leaders who have a combination of executive, regional and anchor account responsibilities. In addition to their management responsibilities, this group of associates is responsible for growing the business by fostering executive-level relationships within accounts and leveraging their existing contacts in the marketplace.
 •The Sales Organization is comprised of associates who are 100% dedicated to generating sales. They are deployed geographically in key markets, primarily focused on developing new relationships and they are aligned to our core group areas within their target accounts. They also handle opportunities in their geographic territories as they arise. We are currently making incremental investments in dedicated sales resources for our Benchmarking, IPaaS, Executive Advisory and Market Intelligence offerings. 
 •The Business Development Associates are comprised of trained groups of telemarketing specialists who are conversant with their respective solution areas. Lead generation is coordinated with our marketing and sales groups to ensure that our inbound and outbound efforts are synchronized with targeted marketing and sales programs.
 •The Delivery Organization is comprised of our billable associates. We encourage associates to pursue additional business development opportunities through their normal course of delivering existing projects thereby helping us expand our business within existing accounts.
 
In addition to our business development resources, we have a corporate marketing and communications organization responsible for overseeing our marketing programs, public relations and employee communications activities.
 We have organized our market focus into the following categories:
 •Strategic Accounts are comprised of large prospects and existing relationships which we believe will have a significant revenue opportunity within the next 18 months. Strategic account criteria include the size of the company, industry affiliation, propensity to buy external consulting services and contacts within the account. The sales representative working closely with regional leadership is primarily responsible for identifying business opportunities in the account, acting as the single point of coordination for the client, and performing the general duties of account manager.
 •Regional Accounts are accounts within a specified geographic location. These accounts mostly include large prospects, past clients, existing medium-sized clients and mid-tier market accounts and are handled primarily on an opportunistic basis, except for active clients where delivery teams are focused on driving additional revenue.
 •Strategic Alliance Accounts are accounts that allow us to partner with organizations of greater scale or different skill sets or with software developers enabling all parties to jointly market their products and services to prospective clients.
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 
 We fully believe that our culture fosters intellectual creativity, collaboration and innovation. We believe in building relationships with both our associates and clients. We believe the best solutions come from teams of diverse individuals addressing problems collectively and from multiple dimensions, including the business, technological and human dimensions. We believe that the most effective working environment is one where everyone is encouraged to contribute and is rewarded for that contribution. Our core values are the strongest expression of our working style and represent what we stand for. These core values are:
 •Continuous development of our associates, our unique content business model and our knowledge base;
 •Diversity of backgrounds, skills and experiences;
 •Knowledge capture, contribution and utilization; and
 •Collaboration with one another, our partners and our clients.



 Our human resources staff includes seasoned professionals in North America, Europe, India and South America who support our groups by, among other things, administering our benefit programs, facilitating the hiring process and coordinating training activities. Our human resources staff also includes dedicated individuals who recruit consultants with both business and technology expertise. Our recruiting team supports our hiring process by focusing on the highest demand solution areas of our business to ensure an adequate pipeline of new associates. We also have an employee referral program, which rewards existing employees who source new hires.
 
 As of December 30, 2022, we had 1,175 associates, excluding subcontractors, 81% of whom were billable professionals. We do not have any associates that are subject to collective bargaining arrangements, however, in France, our associates enjoy the benefit of certain government regulations based on industry classification. We have entered into nondisclosure and non-solicitation agreements with virtually all of our personnel. We also engage consultants as independent contractors pursuant to written agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-solicitation provisions.
 COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
 
 One important way we put our values into action is through our commitment to the communities where we work. We do so by encouraging and supporting our associate’s communities and personal volunteer and service programs and social gatherings.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
 We have obtained trademark registrations for The Hackett Group, Hackett Best Practices, World Class Defined and Enabled, Quantum Leap, Digital Excelleration, Intellectual Property-As-A-Service and Book of Numbers, and own registrations for certain of our other trademarks in the United States and abroad that we use in our business and believe are important to protect. We believe that the protection of these marks is an important part of our strategy of increasing the brand recognition we have built around our empirical knowledge capital and the growing number of services we provide.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 Our business is subject to risks. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other publicly filed documents.
Business, Market and Strategy Risks
 Our results of operations could be negatively affected by global and regional economic conditions.
 Global and regional economic conditions may affect our clients’ businesses and the markets they serve. A substantial or prolonged economic downturn, weak or uncertain economic conditions or similar factors could adversely affect our clients’ financial condition which may reduce our clients’ demand for our services, force price reductions, cause project cancellations, or delay consulting services for which they have engaged us. For example, COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty in the global economy and could result in a reduction in spending on our services and the geopolitical disruption resulting from the Russian and Ukraine conflict. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate the changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.


Our results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially impacted by macroeconomic conditions on our business.
 
 The level of revenue we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. Any prolonged economic downturn as a result of weak or uncertain economic conditions or similar factors could adversely affect our clients' financial condition which may further reduce the clients' demand for our services. These include:
 •general economic and business conditions;
 •interest rate and inflation rate trends and fluctuations;
 •overall demand for services; and
 •currency exchange rate fluctuations.
 Our results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Our clients, and therefore our business and revenues, are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions and business confidence arising from pandemics.

 We continue to work with our clients and employees to responsibly address the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the COVD-19 pandemic or another pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions; the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; and any closures of our clients’ offices and facilities. Clients may also slow down decision making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.
Our quarterly operating results may vary.
 Our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in any given year and should not be used to predict future performance. In future quarters, our operating results may not meet analysts’ and investors’ expectations. If that happens, the price of our common stock may fall. Many factors can cause fluctuations in our financial results, including:
 •number, size, timing and scope of client engagements;
 •customer concentration;
 •long and unpredictable sales cycles;
 •contract terms of client engagements;
 •degrees of completion of client engagements;
 •client engagement delays or cancellations;
 •competition for and utilization of employees;
 •how well we estimate the resources and effort we need to complete client engagements;
 •the integration of acquired businesses;
 •pricing changes in the industry;
 •foreign currency changes;
 •foreign laws and regulatory requirements;
 •natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events;
 •economic conditions specific to business and information technology consulting; and
 •global economic conditions.


A high percentage of our operating expenses, particularly personnel and rent, are fixed in advance of any particular quarter. As a result, if we experience unanticipated changes in client engagements or in consultant utilization rates, we could experience large variations in quarterly operating results and losses in any particular quarter. Due to these factors, we believe our quarter-to-quarter operating results should not be used to predict future performance.
 If we are unable to maintain our reputation and expand our brand name recognition, we may have difficulty attracting new business and retaining current clients and employees.
 We believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining clients and employees in our industry. We also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will continue to increase due to the number of providers of business consulting and IT services. If our reputation is damaged or if potential clients are not familiar with us or with the solutions we provide, we may be unable to attract new, or retain existing, clients and employees. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective solutions. If clients do not perceive our solutions to be effective or of high quality, our brand name and reputation will suffer. In addition, if solutions we provide have defects, critical business functions of our clients may fail, and we could suffer adverse publicity as well as economic liability.
 We depend heavily on a limited number of clients.
 We have derived, and believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients for which we perform large projects. In 2022, our ten largest clients accounted for 24% of our aggregate revenue. In addition, revenue from a large client may constitute a significant portion of our total revenue in any particular quarter. Our customer contracts generally can be cancelled for convenience by the customer upon 30 days’ notice. The loss of any of our large clients for any reason, including as a result of the acquisition of that client by another entity, our failure to meet that client’s expectations, the client’s decision to reduce spending on projects, or failure to collect amounts owed to us from our client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our markets are highly competitive.
 We may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. The business consulting and IT services markets are highly competitive. We expect competition to further intensify as these markets continue to evolve. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, longer relationships with their clients, greater brand or name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements and to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their services. Competitors could lower their prices, potentially forcing us to lower our prices and suffer reduced operating margins. We face competition from international accounting firms; international, national and regional strategic consulting and systems implementation firms; and the IT services divisions of application software firms.
 In addition, there are relatively low barriers for entry into the business consulting and IT services market. We do not own any patented technology that would stop competitors from entering this market and providing services similar to ours. As a result, the emergence of new competitors may pose a threat to our business. Existing or future competitors may develop and offer services that are superior to, or have greater market acceptance, than ours, which could significantly decrease our revenue and the value of your investment.
 
We could lose money on our contracts.
 As part of our strategy, from time to time, we enter into capped or fixed-price contracts, in addition to contracts based on payment for time and materials. Because of the complexity of many of our client engagements, accurately estimating the cost, scope and duration of a particular engagement can be a difficult task. We maintain an Office of Risk Management (“ORM”) that evaluates and attempts to mitigate delivery risk associated with complex projects. In connection with their review, ORM analyzes the critical estimates associated with these projects. If we fail to make these estimates accurately, we could be forced to devote additional resources to these engagements for which we will not receive additional compensation. To the extent that an expenditure of additional resources is required on an engagement, this could reduce the profitability of, or result in a loss on, the engagement. We may be unsuccessful in negotiating with clients regarding changes to the cost, scope or duration of specific engagements. To the extent we do not sufficiently communicate to our clients, or our clients fail to adequately appreciate the nature and extent of any of these types of changes to an engagement, our reputation may be harmed, and we may suffer losses on an engagement.


Lack of detailed written contracts could impair our ability to recognize revenue for services performed, collect fees, protect our IP and protect ourselves from liability to others.
 We protect ourselves by entering into detailed written contracts with our clients covering the terms and contingencies of the client engagement. In some cases, however, consistent with what we believe to be industry practice, work is performed for clients on the basis of a limited statement of work or verbal agreement before a detailed written contract can be finalized. To the extent that we fail to have detailed written contracts in place, our ability to collect fees, protect our IP and protect ourselves from liability to others may be impaired.
 We may lose large clients or may not be able to secure targeted follow-on work or achieve expected client retention rates.
 Our client engagements are generally short-term arrangements, and most clients can reduce or cancel their contracts for our services with a 30 days’ notice and without penalty. As a result, if we lose a major client or large client engagement, our revenue will be adversely affected. We perform varying amounts of work for specific clients from year to year. A major client in one year may not use our services in another year. In addition, we may derive revenue from a major client that constitutes a large portion of total revenue for particular quarters. If we lose any major clients or any of our clients cancel programs or significantly reduce the scope of a large engagement, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Also, if we fail to collect a large accounts receivable balance, we could be subjected to significant financial exposure. Consequently, you should not predict or anticipate our future revenue based upon the number of clients we currently have or the number and size of our existing client engagements.
 We also derive a portion of our revenue from annual memberships for our Executive Advisory Programs. Our growth prospects therefore depend on our ability to achieve and sustain renewal rates on programs and to successfully launch new programs. Failure to achieve expected renewal rate levels or to successfully launch new programs and services could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely.
 The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to:
 •future announcements concerning us or our competitors;
 •quarterly fluctuations in operating results;
 •announcements of acquisitions or technological innovations;
 •changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts; or
 •current market volatility.
 In addition, the stock prices of many business and technology services companies fluctuate widely for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results. Fluctuation in the market price of our common stock may impact our ability to finance our operations and retain personnel.
 Operational Risks
 We have risks associated with potential acquisitions or investments.
 Since our inception, we have expanded through acquisitions. In the future, we plan to pursue additional acquisitions as opportunities arise. We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses which we may acquire in the future without substantial expense, delays or other operational or financial problems. We may not be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses. Also, acquisitions may involve a number of risks, including:
 •diversion of management’s attention;
 •failure to retain key personnel;
 •failure to retain existing clients;
 •unanticipated events or circumstances;
 •unknown claims or liabilities;
 •amortization of certain acquired intangible assets; and
 •operating in new or unfamiliar geographies.


Client dissatisfaction or performance problems at a single acquired business could have a material adverse impact on our reputation as a whole. Further, we cannot assure you that our future acquired businesses will generate anticipated revenue or earnings.
 Difficulties in integrating businesses we acquire in the future may demand time and attention from our senior management.
 Integrating businesses that we acquire in the future may involve unanticipated delays, costs and/or other operational and financial problems. In integrating acquired businesses, we may not achieve expected economies of scale or profitability or realize sufficient revenue to justify our investment. If we encounter unexpected problems as we try to integrate an acquired firm into our business, our management may be required to expend time and attention to address the problems, which would divert their time and attention from other aspects of our business.
 We may not be able to hire, train, motivate, retain and manage professional staff.
 To succeed, we must hire, train, motivate, retain and manage highly skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees who can perform the services we offer is intense. We might not be able to hire enough skilled employees or train, motivate, retain and manage the employees we hire. This could hinder our ability to complete existing client engagements and bid for new ones. Hiring, training, motivating, retaining and managing employees with the skills we need is time-consuming and expensive.
 We rely on information technology and security systems and any damage, interruption or compromise of our information technology and security systems or data could disrupt and harm our business.

We use information technology and security systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in connection with the operation of our business. We also use such systems to protect proprietary and confidential information, including that of our customers, suppliers and employees. We face risks associated with cybersecurity incidents and other significant disruptions of such systems, including denial of service or other similar attacks, to our facilities or systems; unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal information, confidential information or other data we process or maintain; or viruses, loggers, or other malfeasant code, including ransomware, in our data or software. These cybersecurity incidents or other significant disruptions could be caused by persons inside our organization, persons outside our organization with authorized access to systems inside our organization, or by individuals outside our organization. The risk of a cybersecurity incident or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date, as well as those reported to us by our third-party partners, have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, such incidents could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.
 
We also rely on a number of third-party service providers to host, store or otherwise process information for us, or to provide other facilities or infrastructure that we make use of, including “cloud-based” providers of corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, communication services, and some financial functions, and we are therefore dependent on the security systems of these providers. These third-party entities are subject to similar risks as it relates to cybersecurity, business interruption, and systems. Employee failures and a cybersecurity incident or other significant disruption affecting such third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage security systems change frequently and are often not recognized until after an attack, we and our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate the techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, thereby exposing us to material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In order to address risks to our information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies and training. Data protection laws and regulations around the world often require “reasonable,” “appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws and regulations are often uncertain and evolving; there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to protect the information we maintain. A cybersecurity incident or other significant disruption impacting us or our third-party service providers could require a substantial level of financial resources to rectify and otherwise respond to, may be difficult to identify or address in a timely manner, and may divert management’s attention and require the expenditure of significant time and resources. Such cybersecurity incidents or other significant disruptions could result in claims, increased regulatory scrutiny, or investigations, and may cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other liability and related legal and other costs. Any actual or perceived cybersecurity incident or significant disruption may also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements and harm our reputation and market position, especially given that we handle sensitive customer information. Any of the foregoing matters could harm our operating results and financial condition.
 

 While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyber-attacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in amounts and on terms we view as adequate for our operations.
 
A breach of our information technology and security systems could materially adversely affect our business.
 
 We use information technology and security systems to protect proprietary and confidential information, including that of our customers, suppliers and employees. Denial of service or other attacks on, or accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems, unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal information, confidential information or other data we process or maintain, or viruses, loggers, or other malfeasant code, including ransomware, in our data or software, could compromise this information and otherwise disrupt our operations. The consequences of such loss, possible misuse of our proprietary and confidential information, or operational disruptions could include, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty marketing our products, customer allegations of breach-of-contract, claims and litigation by affected parties, investigations by and other proceedings involving governmental authorities and possible financial liabilities for damages, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, reputation and relationships with customers and partners. We also rely on a number of third-party service providers to host, store or otherwise process information for us, or to provide other facilities or infrastructure that we make use of, including "cloud-based" providers of corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and some financial functions, and we are therefore dependent on the security systems of these providers. Any security breaches or incidents or other unauthorized access to, or disruptions of, our service-providers' systems or viruses, loggers, ransomware or other malfeasant code in their data or software, or unauthorized access to or acquisition of any data they process or otherwise maintain for us could expose us to information loss, corruption and unavailability, operational disruptions, and misappropriation of confidential information, and could have similar consequences to us as any incidents affecting our own systems or the data we process or maintain. We and our third parties face these threats from a variety of sources, including attacks from hackers, phishing and other forms of social engineering, and human error or employee or contractor malfeasance. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage security systems change frequently and are often not recognized until after an attack, we and our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate the techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, thereby exposing us to material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. A security breach or other security incident impacting us or our third-party service providers could require a substantial level of financial resources to rectify and otherwise respond to, may be difficult to identify or address in a timely manner, and could result in claims, investigations, and inquires by private parties or governmental entities that may divert management’s attention and require the expenditure of significant time and resources, and which may cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other liability and related legal and other costs. Any actual or perceived security breach or other security incident may also harm our reputation and market position. Any of the foregoing matters could harm our operating results and financial condition.
  Global Operational Risks
 We earn revenue, incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies, and currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results.
 We have international operations, where we earn revenue and incur costs in various foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, and the Euro. Doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas, including revenue, purchases, payroll and investments. Certain foreign currency exposures are naturally offset within an international business unit, because revenue and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency, and certain cash balances are held in U.S. Dollar denominated accounts. However, due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our results.
 Our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls. However, those balances are generally available in the local jurisdiction without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. Any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact the availability and amount of these funds available for transfer.
 Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks
 Our corporate governance provisions may deter a financially attractive takeover attempt.
 Provisions of our charter and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition which shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders would receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include the following:


•shareholders must comply with advance notice requirements before raising a matter at a meeting of shareholders or nominating a director for election;
 •our Board of Directors is staggered into three classes and the members may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote;
 •we would not be required to hold a special meeting to consider a takeover proposal unless holders of more than a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter were to submit a written demand or demands for us to do so; and
 •our Board of Directors may, without obtaining shareholder approval, classify and issue up to 1,250,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, preferences, designations and rights that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.
 If we are unable to protect our IP rights or infringe on the IP rights of third parties, our business may be harmed.
 We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license IP. Although we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and limit distribution of proprietary information, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our IP, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our IP rights.
 Although we believe that our services do not infringe on the IP rights of others and that we have all rights necessary to utilize the IP employed in our business, we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third-party IP rights. Any claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation, pay damages, develop non-infringing IP or acquire licenses to the IP that is the subject of asserted infringement.
 Data privacy and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks.
We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. We operate in an environment in which data privacy regulatory and legal framework is evolving quickly and varies by jurisdiction. We cannot predict the cost of compliance with future data privacy laws, regulations and standards, or future interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, related to privacy and cybersecurity or the potential effects on our business.
As a company doing business in Europe, we are also subject to European data protection laws and regulations. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), imposes stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. In addition, we are also subject to and affected by new state privacy and data security laws such as the recently implemented California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CCPA became effective January 1, 2020 and imposes additional data privacy requirements on many businesses operating in the state, including, potentially, with respect to employee data. In addition, in 2020 several states introduced varying comprehensive privacy laws modeled to some degree on the CCPA and/or the GDPR. Compliance with multiple country and state laws containing varying requirements could be complicated and costly. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
