INTRODUCTION

Logicquest Technology, Inc. (the Company) was originally incorporated as Solis Communications, Inc. on July 23, 2001 and adopted a name change to Crescent Communications Inc. upon completion of a reverse acquisition of Berens Industries, Inc. In 2004, we changed our name to Bluegate Corporation (Bluegate). On March 19, 2015, we changed our name to Logicquest Technology, Inc.

Logicquest is a Nevada corporation that previously consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business, which provided internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During May 2014 the Board of Directors authorized an orderly wind down of the Company's internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014.

CORPORATE HISTORY

In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). Two of the many features of HIPAA were a mandate that the healthcare industry move toward using electronic communication technology to streamline and reduce the cost of healthcare, and a requirement that healthcare providers treat virtually all healthcare information as confidential, especially when electronically transmitted.

In 2001, Mr. Manfred Sternberg acquired effective control of the Company and during 2002 and 2003 under his leadership, the company commenced development and completion of the necessary systems to offer integrated HIPAA compliant Medical Grade Network® to the health care community to provide electronic systems required by increasing U.S. public policy mandates to accelerate the movement to secure electronic health records.

In 2003, a minority amount of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2004, a majority of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2005, all of our revenues were related to our health care service model.

In 2004, to accelerate our movement into the electronic health record business, we sold our Internet Service Provider ("ISP") customer base effective June 21, 2004 to concentrate on our health care IT solutions model and its Medical Grade Network®.

In 2004, we contracted with the largest healthcare system in Texas to provide physicians with Internet bandwidth and managed security services using our Medical Grade Network®.

In March 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of TEKMedia Communications, Inc., a company that provided traditional IT consulting services.

In September 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of Trilliant Corporation, a company that provides assessment, design, vendor selection, procurement and project management for large technology initiatives, particularly in the healthcare arena.

Effective May 31, 2009, Mr. Koehler resigned as President from the company.
