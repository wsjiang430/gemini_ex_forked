ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Overview
Energy Recovery, Inc. (the “Company”, “Energy Recovery”, “we”, “our” and “us”) (NASDAQ: ERII) is an engineering-driven technology company that engineers, designs, manufactures and supplies solutions for industrial fluid flow processes. The Company offers technologies which can drive meaningful, immediate cost savings and operational efficiencies for our customers. Currently, we operate in two markets - water and oil & gas, and our products are utilized in these markets to either recycle and convert wasted pressure energy into a usable asset or preserve pumps that are subject to hostile processing environments. 
Energy Recovery was incorporated in Virginia in 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our headquarters and principal research, development, and manufacturing facility is located in California. We are also constructing a new facility in Texas, which we hope to complete in 2019. We maintain direct sales offices and technical support centers in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. 
Water 
For more than 20 years, Energy Recovery has been developing innovative and efficient technologies and solutions for the reverse osmosis water desalination industry. Climate change, increasing water scarcity, as well as population and economic growth across the globe are driving water demand for human, agricultural, and industrial use. Apart from seasonal variations, the supply of fresh water generally remains fixed, and in some geographic areas is falling, and cannot keep pace with this growing demand. Desalination of seawater, brackish water and wastewater offers one solution to water scarcity needs around the world. In many parts of the world, desalination contributes significantly to the freshwater supply.
Solutions
We are the market leader in the engineering, design, manufacturing and supply of energy recovery devices (“ERDs”) to the global reverse osmosis desalination market. Our ERDs are categorized into two technology groups: positive displacement isobaric ERDs, namely our proprietary Pressure Exchanger (“PX Pressure Exchanger”), and centrifugal-type ERDs such as our hydraulic turbochargers (“Turbochargers”). We also manufacture high-performance and high-efficiency pumps that are utilized in the reverse osmosis desalination process.
Energy Recovery Devices
Prior to the introduction of ERDs, the expense of reverse osmosis desalination was often cost prohibitive due to the high energy needs required in the process. Generally speaking, energy intensive pumps are used to pressurize the feed water, weather seawater or brackish water, which is then forced through a membrane that removes the salts and minerals. The process results in potable water, suitable for human, agricultural and industrial use. In the case of seawater reverse osmosis (“SWRO”) desalination, for example, this process results in a highly concentrated and pressurized concentrate stream. Prior to the adoption of ERDs, this concentrate stream was often discharged back into the world’s oceans after dissipating the pressure through throttle valves, thereby wasting the pressure energy. The repeated pressurization of the feed water and subsequent dissipation of the pressure energy in the discharge water was inefficient and resulted in tremendous amounts of wasted energy that made SWRO desalination substantially more expensive that alternative water production options. 
When introduced, ERDs fundamentally altered this paradigm by capturing and reusing this wasted pressure energy. Rather than dissipating the pressure energy from the discharge brine, ERDs such as our PX Pressure Exchanger can transfer the pressure energy from the discharge water directly to the unprocessed feed water, thereby reducing the amount of ongoing pressure energy required by the processes’ pumps. This results in a much more efficient process as the size of the high-pressure pumps and the corresponding energy usage are reduced. As a result, ERDs have made SWRO desalination a viable economic option in the production of potable water.

The brackish water reverse osmosis (“BWRO”) desalination process is identical to that of the SWRO desalination process. Brackish water typically has lower salt content than seawater, therefore fewer solids need to be removed and less energy is expended on pressurizing the feed water. The amount of salts in the feedwater will ultimately determine the system design and operating conditions which, in turn, will drive decisions related to the specification or type of energy recovery device to be employed, if any. Due to the lower cost involved, our Turbocharger devices generally have characteristics more applicable to BWRO, although this is not always the case. 
The PX Pressure Exchanger, high efficiency positive-displacement isobaric energy recovery device. Our patented PX Pressure Exchanger technology consists of a ceramic rotor supported by a highly efficient hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearing system. Our PX Pressure Exchangers compete largely in the SWRO industry, or in higher salination BWRO desalination applications, and enable desalination plant operators to recover otherwise wasted hydraulic pressure energy from a high-pressure fluid flow and transfer the energy to a low-pressure fluid flow. 
Turbochargers, high efficiency centrifugal energy recovery device. Our Turbochargers are designed for low-pressure brackish and high-pressure seawater reverse osmosis systems, as well as various other water treatment applications. Our Turbochargers provide high efficiency with state-of-the-art engineering and configuration. Designed for maximum durability, reliability and optimum efficiency, our Turbochargers offer substantial savings, and the custom-designed hydraulics allow for optimum performance over a wide range of operating conditions. Our Turbochargers complete primarily in BWRO desalination applications, where the systems have characteristics more applicable to our Turbocharger technology. However, our Turbocharger technology is also implemented in SWRO desalination applications where initial cost, simplicity and / or low energy costs are key factors in the decision-making process. 
Pumps
High efficiency pumps, high-pressure feed and high-pressure circulation pumps.  In addition to ERDs, water reverse osmosis desalination requires specialized high-pressure feed and circulation pumps. These devices, in combination with ERDs, must efficiently pressurize and circulate feedwater to the membranes to purify water. Plant operators require specialized pumps with performance matched to the requirements of the membranes and energy recovery devices. To minimize plant costs these pumps must provide high energy efficiency and reliability with low maintenance requirements. Specifically designed for the reverse osmosis industry, our pumps utilize our material science and hydraulic design expertise. Designed for maximum durability, reliability, and optimum efficiency, our pumping systems offer users savings, while the investment cast components and optimized fluid pathways ensure maximum performance. 
We manufacture and / or supply specialized high-pressure feed and circulation pumps for only a portion of the markets served by our ERD solutions, generally in small- to medium-sized desalination plants. Our high-pressure feed pumps are designed to pressurize the membrane feed flow and overcome the osmotic pressure requirements of the feed water resulting in the production of permeate water. Our high-pressure circulation pumps are designed to “circulate” and control the high-pressure flow rates through the PX Pressure Exchanger and to compensate for small pressure losses across the membrane, PX Pressure Exchanger and associated process piping. 
Markets
Seawater, brackish, and wastewater reverse osmosis desalination have been our markets for revenue generation to date. The water market ranges from small desalination plants such as those used in cruise ships and resorts, to mega-project desalination plants deployments globally that process 50,000 cubic meters of water per day and above. Because of the geographical location of many significant water desalination projects, geopolitical and economic events can influence the timing of expected projects. We anticipate that markets traditionally not associated with desalination, including the United States (“U.S.”) will inevitably develop and provide further revenue growth opportunities.

Greenfield
The greenfield market represents newly constructed reverse osmosis desalination projects. These facilities vary in size, scope and geography. Largescale greenfield projects are typically public in nature and involve a formal tendering process. Smaller greenfield projects may be private in nature, but typically still involve a formal tendering process. We work directly with the project bidders, generally large engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) firms, end-users and industry consultants to scope in our products prior to the project being awarded, where possible. Once the project is awarded to an EPC, our normal sales process ensues. The greenfield market has been the key market for our water business. This market is highly competitive, and the tendering process pays close attention to the cost to desalinate water (i.e., dollars per cubic meter of water produced). Our PX Pressure Exchanger’s industry-leading efficiency for ERDs in the desalination industry has allowed us to remain competitive.
Retrofit
The retrofit market represents existing water facilities that are currently in operation utilizing legacy technologies. These facilities and their owners not only encounter issues with low-efficiency legacy technologies, but also encounter capital expenditure and “know-how” issues that may prevent them from retrofitting plants. Typical retrofits include improvements to existing operations, equipment upgrades and potential expansions of existing capacity. We leverage our best-in-class solutions and “know how” to unseat existing technology by implementing water production efficiency measures to reduce overall power consumed, repair and maintenance costs and avoid costly capital upgrades, as well as increase throughput and/or plant availability. These retrofit opportunities may or may not have a formal tendering process. We typically approach the plant operators, owners and/or end-users of these facilities to present our value-proposition.
Service & Aftermarket

The service & aftermarket market is comprised of existing water facilities that have our solutions installed or in operation. We provide spare and repaired components, field services and various commissioning activities to our customer base. We leverage our water expertise in supporting our existing installed base to ensure that our solutions are being operated effectively and efficiently. Readily available aftermarket products and services are required by our industry partners and customers in order maximize plant availability and profits.
Customers
We sell our energy recovery devices and pumps to (1) major international EPC firms that can design, build, own and operate large-scale desalination plants (mega projects); (2) original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) which are companies that supply equipment and packaged solutions for small- to medium-sized desalination plants, and national, state and local municipalities worldwide; and (3) plant owners and/or operators who can utilize our technology to upgrade or keep their plant running, or retrofit their existing plant equipment with various efficiency measures to optimize operations by reducing overall power consumed and reduce other operating costs in the desalination process.
Large Engineering, Procurement and Construction Firms
A significant portion of our revenue has historically come from sales to large EPC firms worldwide which have the required desalination expertise to engineer, undertake procurement for, construct, and sometimes own and operate, large desalination plants or mega-projects. Due to the enormous volume of water processed by these mega-projects, ongoing operating costs rather than initial capital expenditures is the key factor in their selection of an ERD solution. As such, EPCs most often select our PX Pressure Exchangers, which offers the highest efficiency and total life-cycle-cost savings to the end client. We work with these EPC firms to specify our PX Pressure Exchanger solutions for their plant designs. The time between project tender and shipment can range from 16 to 36 months, or more. Each mega-project typically represents revenue opportunities ranging from $1 million to $10 million.
We estimate that the total capital investments in these mega-projects may fall between $50 million to $1 billion or more. Due to the large capital investments needed to fund these projects, which are typically provided by national or local governments, these projects are more susceptible to macroeconomic and regional risks, such as economic downturns, currency shocks, or political risks.

Original Equipment Manufacturers
We sell a broad set of our products to OEMs including our PX Pressure Exchangers, Turbochargers, high-pressure pumps, and circulation “booster” pumps. Our sale of solutions and services to OEM suppliers are for integration and use in small- to medium-sized desalination plants processing up to 50,000 cubic meters of water per day located in local municipalities, hotels and resorts, power plants, cruise ships, farm operations, among others. In addition, these OEMs purchase our solutions for “quick water” or emergency water solutions. 
Unlike mega-projects, OEM projects are smaller in scope and, as such, the initial capital expenditure, rather than future ongoing operating costs, is often the key factor in selection of an ERD solution. Accordingly, we sell not only our PX Pressure Exchanger, but also our Turbochargers, which offer a lower cost alternative to the PX Pressure Exchanger. The typical time from project tender and shipment can range from one to 12 months. OEM projects typically represent revenue opportunities of up to $1 million or more.
Capital investments in OEM projects can be as high as $100 million, but typically range between $10 - $50 million. Due to the lower capital investment of these projects, such projects are more likely to be privately financed, or financed by local municipalities. Due to a more diverse customer base and source of financing, OEM projects tend to be less susceptible to economic and regional shocks, and to provide a more stable source of revenue to the company.
End-users and Service Providers
Our existing and expanding installed base of energy recovery and pump products in water plants has created a growing customer base comprised of plant operators and service providers. These customers purchase spare parts, replacement parts, and service contracts, as well as utilize our field service expertise to perform maintenance and repairs. Owners and operators of older plants without effective energy recovery devices, and newer plants with devices manufactured by our competitors, purchase our equipment to retrofit plants to realize operational expense reductions or expansions in plant capacity.
Competition
The market for ERDs and pumps in the water treatment market is competitive. As the demand for fresh water increases and the market expands, we expect competition to persist and intensify.
We have three main competitors for our ERDs: Flowserve Corporation (“Flowserve”), Fluid Equipment Development Company (“FEDCO”), and Danfoss Group (“Danfoss”). We believe our solutions offer a competitive advantage compared to our competitor’s solutions because our ERDs provide the lowest life-cycle cost and are therefore the most cost-effective ERD solutions for the reverse osmosis desalination industry over time.
In the market for large mega-projects, our PX Pressure Exchanger competes primarily with Flowserve’s DWEER product. We believe our PX Pressure Exchangers have a competitive advantage as compared to the DWEER product because our devices are made with highly durable and corrosion-resistant ceramic parts that are designed for a life of more than 25 years, are warranted for high efficiencies, cause minimal unplanned downtime, and offer lower lifecycle costs. Additionally, the PX Pressure Exchanger offers optimum scalability with a quick startup as well as no scheduled maintenance. 
In the market for small-to-medium-sized desalination plants, our ERD solutions compete with FEDCO’s turbochargers and Danfoss’s iSave energy recovery device. We believe that our PX Pressure Exchangers have a distinct competitive advantage over these solutions because our devices provide up to 98% energy efficiency, have lower lifecycle maintenance costs, and are made of highly durable and corrosion-resistant ceramic parts. We also believe that our Turbochargers compete favorably with FEDCO’s turbochargers based on efficiency, price and because our turbochargers have design advantages that enhance efficiency, operational flexibility, and serviceability.
In the applicable market and flow ranges that we serve for high-pressure pumps and circulation pumps, our solutions compete with pumps manufactured by Clyde Union Ltd.; FEDCO; Flowserve; KSB Aktiengesellschaft; Torishima Pump Mfg. Co., Ltd.; Sulzer Pumps, Ltd.; and other companies. We believe that our pump solutions are competitive with these solutions because our pumps are developed specifically for reverse osmosis desalination, are highly efficient, feature product-lubricated bearings, and are often purchased with our ERDs in small- to medium-sized plants.

Operations
Our water products are manufactured at our facility located in San Leandro, California, where our PX Pressure Exchangers, Turbochargers and pumps are produced, assembled, and tested. Our 100,000 sq. ft manufacturing area includes an advanced ceramics manufacturing facility and testing laboratory, five hydraulic performance testing loops, CNC machines, assembly stations and warehouse. Ceramic components for the PX device are manufactured in-house from high-grade, raw alumina to the final product. Components for our other products also undergo final precision finishing in San Leandro to protect the proprietary nature of our manufacturing methods and product designs and to maintain premium quality standards. The availability of multiple test loops allows us to test every water product we manufacture to its full rated operating conditions.
We obtain raw, processed and certain pre-machined materials from various suppliers to support our manufacturing operations. A limited number of these suppliers are near sole-source to maintain material consistency and support new product development. A qualified redundant material source exists in all cases.
Our production facility operates under the principles of Lean Manufacturing and continuously seeks ways to improve product and process performance. Our manufacturing operations is certified to ISO9001:2015 standards.
Water field activities are conducted by our after-market and field service organization on-site at customer locations.
Seasonality
We often experience substantial fluctuations in product revenue from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year because a single order for our ERDs by a large EPC firm for a particular plant may represent a significant portion of our revenue. Prior to 2018, our EPC customers tended to order a significant amount of equipment for delivery in the fourth quarter, and as a consequence, a significant portion of our annual sales typically occurred during the fourth quarter. This trend did not repeat itself in 2018, however, and seasonality as experienced in prior years may not be the same in future years.
Oil & Gas
Across oil & gas markets, highly pressurized fluid flows are required to extract and process hydrocarbons. These pressurized fluid flows are a necessity but come at a high cost to the oil & gas industry. In the upstream sector, high rates of flow, high pressure differentials and hostile (e.g., corrosive, erosive or abrasive) fluids lead to rapid degradation of expensive pressure pumping equipment. In the mid-stream and down-stream sectors, pressure energy becomes a waste product at various stages of oil and gas processing thereby driving excessive energy usage and cost. Oil & gas operators seek ways to reduce these costs and improve overall productivity.

Markets
Upstream Sector
Hydraulic fracturing is a well-stimulation technique in which pressurized liquid containing a highly abrasive, proppant-laden fluid is injected into a wellbore. Oilfield service (“OFS”) providers utilize high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps (commonly referred to as “frac-pumps”) to pressurize fracturing fluid (commonly referred to as “frac-fluid”) at treating pressures up to 15,000 pounds per square inch (“psi”). This frac-fluid is sent from the frac-pumps through traditional missile manifolds into the wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations thereby permitting oil and gas extraction. These frac-pumps are routinely destroyed by the abrasive frac-fluids used during the hydraulic fracturing process causing significant OFS operator costs associated with excessive downtime, repairs, maintenance, and capital equipment redundancy.
During mud pumping in the drilling process, a drilling fluid (commonly referred to as “drilling mud”) is circulated from a mud pit through the wellbore utilizing high-pressure mud pumps, which pressurize the drilling mud at treating pressures up to 7,500 psi, to control formation pressures, lubricate the drill bit, and to remove cuttings. Although the existing mud pumping process removes most of the solids from the drilling mud, debris and sand often remain. The pumps circulating the drilling mud is therefore subjected to extreme wear, resulting in burdensome repair and maintenance costs. Components of these mud pumps are routinely destroyed by the hostile drilling mud used during the mud pumping process causing OFS operators significant costs associated with excessive downtime, repairs, maintenance, capital equipment redundancy, safety, and rig mobilization.
OFS operators have long sought ways to ruggedize or extend the life of pumps thereby reducing costs in both the hydraulic fracturing and drilling processes. We believe the most efficient method of extending the life of these pumps is to isolate the high-pressure pumps from the abrasive fluids completely, thereby enabling OFS operators to realize immediate and long-term savings in the form of reduced downtime, repairs and maintenance costs and capital equipment redundancy.
Midstream and Downstream Sectors
Today, natural gas is typically processed by removing acid gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide before it is ready for distribution and use. A common acid gas removal process uses an amine solvent to absorb acid gases in a high-pressure contactor column. Having absorbed the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, the pressurized (rich) amine is then depressurized and processed into regenerated (lean) amine for reuse. An ERD, such as a Turbocharger, can recover the energy wasted during this reduction in pressure of the amine. This recovered energy can then be converted to electricity, or hydraulic energy, which eliminates the need for a high-pressure pump. Fewer high-pressure pumps reduce capital expenditures, and energy and maintenance costs, positively impacting plant availability.
Within pipeline applications, crude oil or final hydrocarbon products must be pressurized to travel from upstream gathering facilities or refineries, to terminals and tank farms. Fluid pressure builds within the pipeline during transport, and this pressure must be reduced before storing the liquid. This required pressure-drop, typically managed through a control valve that simply dissipates the energy into the atmosphere, represents an opportunity to generate electricity from otherwise wasted pressure energy.
Solutions
Our technology solutions seek to preserve or eliminate pumping technology in hostile processing environments or convert wasted pressure energy into a reusable asset. Our core oil & gas solutions based upon PX Pressure Exchanger technology, the VorTeq and MTeq, isolate high cost pumping equipment from hostile processing fluids. Our centrifugal line of solutions based upon our Turbocharger technology, the IsoBoost and IsoGen, recycle otherwise lost pressure energy.
Upstream Sector
VorTeq, a PX solution for hydraulic fracturing applications: The VorTeq technology isolates and preserves costly frac-pumps by re-routing hostile frac-fluid away from the frac-pumps, and ultimately enables a more efficient pumping model. Using VorTeq, the frac-pumps will process only clean fluid, which leads to reduced repairs and maintenance costs, reduced capital costs by extending frac-pump life expectancy, and the elimination of redundant capital equipment. Our VorTeq techlology is currently in the research and development (“R&D”) stage. We completed a substantial re-design of the VorTeq during 2017 and have progressed the technology significantly in 2018. Our focus remains on commercializing this technology.
– 11 –

MTeq, a PX solution for mud pumping applications: Our MTeq technology isolates and preserves costly mud pumps by re-routing hostile drilling mud from these critical pumps, and ultimately enables a more efficient pumping model. These mud pumps will process only clean fluid, which leads to reduced repairs and maintenance costs and reduced capital costs by extending pump life expectancy and eliminating redundant capital equipment. Our MTeq technology is currently in the R&D stage and we are actively working towards progressing this technology. We designed the MTeq during late 2016 and early 2017 and completed building the first prototype in December 2017.
Midstream and Downstream Sectors
IsoBoost & IsoGen, turbocharger solutions, for gas processing & pipeline applications: Within the gas processing and pipeline pressure down cycle, the IsoBoost and IsoGen technology enables the recovery of pressure energy in the fluid flows either through the exchange of pressure within the application or by converting it to electricity. Our technology enables gas processing plant and pipeline owners and operators to achieve immediate and long-term energy savings with little or no operational disruption. Our IsoBoost is comprised of hydraulic turbochargers and related controls and automation systems. The IsoBoost solution enables oil & gas operators to capture and use wasted hydraulic pressure energy within the acid gas removal process, acting like a pump that is powered by hydraulic pressure that would otherwise be discarded through a control valve. Our IsoGen is comprised of hydraulic turbines, generators, and related controls and automation systems. The IsoGen enables oil & gas operators to generate electricity from the hydraulic energy in high-pressure fluid flows, either within the acid gas removal process in gas processing or at pipeline choke stations.
Customers
We license, lease or sell our oil and gas products to oil field service companies, international oil companies (“IOC”), national oil companies (“NOC”), exploration and production companies (“E&P”), OEMs and EPC firms.
Oilfield Service Companies
OFS companies provide the infrastructure, equipment, intellectual property, and services needed by the oil & gas industry to explore for, extract, and transport crude oil and natural gas. OFS hydraulic fracturing and mud pumping operators face significant pressure to reduce costs as oil & gas companies curtail capital expenditures and seek operational efficiencies in response to lower commodity prices.
In 2014, we entered into a strategic partnership with Liberty Oil Field Services (“Liberty”) to pilot and conduct field trials with the VorTeq. Through this agreement, Liberty has the rights to lease up to twenty VorTeq missiles for a period of up to five years following commercialization. In 2015, we entered into a 15-year license agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation (the “VorTeq Licensee”) for the exclusive, worldwide right to use the VorTeq for hydraulic fracturing onshore operations. The license agreement provides a carve out for Liberty’s contractual rights to utilize the VorTeq. We are currently working with the VorTeq Licensee and Liberty to commercialize the VorTeq technology.
As the MTeq technology matures, the Company intends to evaluate the best potential distribution method for the technology, which may include long term licensing partnerships with OFS companies that specialize in drilling wells or OEMs that supply or lease equipment to market participants. 
Gas Processing & Pipeline Operators
We have contracted and delivered oil & gas solutions to customers in North America, Asia, and the Middle East for use in gas processing applications. Our target market consists of gas processing plants, pipeline substations and ammonia plants worldwide. Our IsoGen solution has been installed in a major gas processing plant in the Middle East.
In 2016, we received our first major purchase order for multiple units of our IsoBoost solution for integration into a major gas processing plant under construction in the Middle East. We completed and shipped the initial units to the Middle East in fourth quarter of 2018. In April 2017, we entered into a 10-year licensing agreement with Alderley FZE for our IsoBoost & IsoGen technologies in gas processing and pipeline applications within the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”), as well as Iraq and Iran to the extent international sanctions and laws permit.

Competition
The landscape for our technology within the oil & gas market is competitive as the industry is continuously seeking ways to reduce costs and extend the life of assets used in the production or transportation of hydrocarbons. As demand for our products increases, we expect competition to intensify.
We believe our VorTeq technology represents a competitive advantage over existing missile manifold technology because our solution re-routes abrasive proppant away from high-pressure pumps and will provide OFS operators the option to transition to more robust, longer lived, centrifugal pumps thereby further decreasing operating and capital costs. While our VorTeq replaces a traditional manifold, the competitors to our VorTeq are the high-pressure frac pump manufacturers. There are a multitude of these pump manufacturers, including Gardner Denver, Inc., FMC Technologies, the Weir Group, Stewart & Stevenson and Forum Energy Technologies.
Similar to the VorTeq, the MTeq enhances the useful life of mud pumps and consumable pump components used in land drilling by re-routing the hostile drilling mud away from the high-pressure pumps and OFS operators have the option to transition to more robust, longer life, centrifugal pumps thereby further decreasing operating and capital costs. The competition to the MTeq is a more robust mud pump or more durable mud pump components. The primary manufacturers of mud pumps are National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Gardner Denver, Inc. and Cameron International Corporation.
Several companies manufacture competitive technology to the IsoGen, which primarily consists of reverse running pumps (also called hydraulic power recovery turbines or HPRTs) and perform a basic form of energy recovery. Manufacturers of reverse running pumps include, but are not limited to, Flowserve, Sulzer Pumps, Ltd., and Shin Nippon Machinery. Several companies manufacture hydraulic turbochargers, which could eventually develop into competitive technology to the IsoBoost. However, none of these companies that manufacture turbochargers have significant experience within gas processing. In order to utilize a turbocharger in gas processing, expertise is required to validate the system level design and integration within a gas processing application.
Sales and Marketing
In the oil & gas market, we target OFSs, IOCs, NOCs, E&Ps, OEMs or EPCs on behalf of oil producers and chemical producers who have applications for our solutions and services. We endeavor to limit capital sales into the oil & gas market, thereby minimizing installation and distribution costs, as well as associated sales and marketing expenses. As a result, our primary go-to-market strategy in the oil & gas market is through technology licensing as outlined in the Customer section of this overview.
A significant portion of our revenue is from outside of the U.S. Additional segment and geographical information regarding our product revenue is included in Note 14, “Geographical Information and Concentrations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Operations
Our oil & gas product manufacturing, assembly, and testing has been historically managed through our operations in Ireland. In October 2018, these functions were transitioned to the U.S. branch of our Ireland operating company, which is resident in Malta. To produce our oil & gas products, we utilize multiple supply chain partners, in addition to our San Leandro manufacturing facility. We complete critical machining, assembly, and testing operations in-house to protect the proprietary nature of our manufacturing methods and product designs and to maintain premium quality standards. Our Ireland operations has also historically been responsible for overseeing the commercialization of the VorTeq. Likewise, in October 2018, this responsibility was transitioned to the U.S. branch of our Ireland operating company, which is tax resident in Malta.
Oil & gas field activities are conducted by our field operations organization, which also provides support to R&D activities leading to VorTeq and MTeq commercialization.
In January 2019, we signed a long-term lease for a new facility near Houston, Texas. This facility will consolidate our Texas Oil & Gas operations and allow us to test our VorTeq and MTeq technologies at scale and in real world conditions on a regular, uninterrupted basis. The facility will also house equipment to manufacture, machine, inspect and test tungsten carbide components in support of R&D and eventual commercialization.

Seasonality
In our Oil & Gas segment, we do not currently have enough history to determine seasonal revenue patterns.
Research and Development
Energy Recovery’s focus on R&D is a key driver of the company’s future evolution. When developing products, we seek four distinct process criteria: (1) high rates of fluid flow; (2) large pressure differentials; (3) hostile fluids; and (4) high degrees of capital intensity, specifically in the form of pumping and/or compression assets. Using these criteria, our product development strategy is to identify fluid flow applications where equipment is being destroyed or adversely affected and/or where pressure energy is being wasted. We maintain a product development road map, which guides R&D resource allocation across all business units. Our R&D team guides products through defined development stages with structured toll-gate reviews throughout the process.
The Company has invested significantly in R&D to support our product development strategy and has grown its R&D headcount by 45 percent since 2013. We maintain advanced testing capabilities at our headquarters in San Leandro, California and are building new testing facilities for oil & gas applications in Texas.
Our engineers specialize in a range of technical fields spanning the Company’s core engineering competencies of fluid mechanics and aerodynamics, solid mechanics with expertise in computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis, bearings design (roller-element, hydrostatic, and hydrodynamic), multi-phase flow, dynamics and controls, acoustics and vibrations, tribology, material science and coatings, pumps and turbines, aircraft engines, turbomachines, and rotating machinery.
 We have invested in advanced numerical modeling and analytical tools that allow for 3D, multi-phase, multi-physics, and multi-scale computational fluid dynamics and fluid structure interactions. Leading-edge modeling and analytical techniques coupled with extensive experimental capabilities allow us to further refine our existing water and oil and gas technologies, as well as develop new derivatives of the PX pressure exchanger for complex systems and applications.
We have advanced testing capabilities in our San Leandro facility to test our PX Pressure Exchanger, Turbocharger, and pump technologies. We are building new testing facilities in Texas that will allow us to test our oil & gas products at full scale. In 2018, we made a sizable investment in high pressure frac equipment such as frac pumps, blenders, and other equipment to bolster our testing capabilities in Texas to advance our VorTeq and MTeq solutions.
Today our R&D investments are focused on (1) commercialization of our VorTeq and MTeq solutions; (2) advances to our existing PX pressure exchanger, turbocharger, and pump technologies to better service our water end markets; (3) development of new pump technologies in support of our water business; and (4) fundamental research into new applications of our PX pressure exchanger technology in existing and new verticals.
Intellectual Property
We seek patent protection for new technologies, inventions, and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our solutions. We rely on patents, trade secret laws, and contractual safeguards to protect the proprietary tooling, processing techniques, and other know-how used in the production of our solutions. We have a robust intellectual property portfolio consisting of U.S. and international issued patents as well as pending patent applications.
We have registered the following trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark office: “ERI,” “PX,” “PX Pressure Exchanger,” “Pressure Exchanger,” the Energy Recovery logo, “Making Desalination Affordable,” “IsoBoost,” and “IsoGen.” Applications are pending for “VorTeq” and “MTeq.” We have also applied for and received registrations in international trademark offices.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, and the Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Stockholders are made available, free of charge, in the Investor Relations section of our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information contained on our website or any other website is not part of this report nor is it considered to be incorporated by reference herein or with any other filing we make with the SEC. Our headquarters and primary manufacturing center is located at 1717 Doolittle Drive, San Leandro, California 94577, and our main telephone number is (510) 483-7370. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC and the address of that site (http://www.sec.gov).
