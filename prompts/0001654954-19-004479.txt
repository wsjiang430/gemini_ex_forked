 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
  Overview
  We manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of industrial protective clothing and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market. Our products are sold globally by our in-house sales teams, our customer service group, and authorized independent sales representatives to a network of over 1,600  global safety and industrial supply distributors. Our authorized distributors supply end users, such as integrated oil, chemical/petrochemical, automobile, steel, glass, construction, smelting, cleanroom, janitorial, pharmaceutical, and high technology electronics manufacturers, as well as scientific, medical laboratories and the utilities industry. In addition, we supply federal, state and local governmental agencies and departments, such as fire and law enforcement, airport crash rescue units, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control. Internationally, we sell to a mixture of end users directly, and to industrial distributors depending on the particular country and market. Sales are made to more than 50 countries, the majority of which were into China, the European Economic Community (“EEC”), Canada, Chile, Argentina, Russia, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, India and Southeast Asia. For purposes of this Form 10-K, FY refers to a fiscal year ended January 31; for example, FY19 refers to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. In FY19 we had net sales of $99.0 million and $96.0 million in FY18.
  
 For the first half of the year (FY 19), economic growth and investment globally was relatively strong as the global economy continued its recovery from the second half of FY 2018.  In the second half of FY19 we encountered headwinds due to threatened changes to U.S. trade policies relative to several key markets in which we manufacture and sell, specifically China and Mexico.  In Europe, uncertainty around Brexit saw customers less confident in economic growth. This was reflected in the purchases and business investment of many of our EEC end users. This in turn limited growth opportunities in these markets while leading to more aggressive pricing from the competition which had to be met. Unfortunately during the second half of the fiscal year, global talks between the US administration and China and the U.K and European Union became more contentious and less certain. In addition, in the second half of FY19, Lakeland initiated a significant global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) project in order to strengthen its foundation for future growth globally. The result of this investment was an increase in operating expenses and some loss of sales due to operational issues relating to the ERP implementation, adversely effecting operating results.

 The Company recognizes the need to grow faster than what organic growth will contribute, so it has accelerated product development, is pressing ahead aggressively with the rollout of our new ERP system, investing in increasing our global manufacturing capacity by opening new manufacturing facilities, and investing in new manufacturing equipment and processes to reduce manufacturing costs and increase efficiencies.
  
 Additionally, a major strategic companywide objective to accelerate growth throughout the Company is to push additional products and sales tools that are successful in the key US and China markets to the other international operations, which have traditionally carried smaller lines. To facilitate this, the Company is evaluating and redeploying sales and marketing assets into regions that offer the greatest potential for sales and margin growth. 
  
 As always, the cornerstone of the Company’s strategy is the belief that owning and operating its own factories is a strategic advantage for Lakeland. It provides the Company with advantages over its competition in terms of rapidly scaling up manufacturing to meet emergency demand, shift product between manufacturing locations to take advantage of ever changing trade agreements, and to maintain the highest level of product quality. In contrast, most of the Company’s competitors utilize contractors. Contractor agreements significantly reduce their market responsiveness as the contractors typically require forecast leadtimes in excess of 30 days and service multiple customers; all of whom are vying for their capacity in times of emergency or unusually high demand. The end result is longer lead times and higher costs as contractors bid up prices.
 
  Industry Overview
  The industrial work clothing market includes our limited use/disposable protective or safety clothing, high-end chemical protective suits, high visibility clothing/vests, firefighting and heat protective apparel, gloves and reusable woven Flame Resistant (FR) and arc flash protective garments. The industrial protective safety clothing market in the United States has evolved over the past 49 years as a result of governmental regulations and requirements and commercial product development. In 1970, Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, which requires employers to supply protective clothing in certain work environments.  Certain states have also enacted worker safety laws that further supplement OSHA standards and requirements.
  
 The advent of OSHA coincided with the development of light disposable fabrics, such as SMS (a three layered nonwoven) and Polypropylene which, for the first time, allowed for the economical production of lightweight, disposable protective clothing. The attraction of disposable garments grew in the late 1970s as a result of increases in labor and material costs of producing cloth garments and the promulgation of federal, state and local safety regulations. Also, in order to comply with World Trade Organization (“WTO”) entry requirements, foreign countries are beginning to adopt and imitate OSHA regulations, American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) and Committee European de Normalization (“CE”) standards. Thus, these developing international markets are growing much more rapidly than the US markets.
 
  International and Domestic Standards
  Standards development, within both the US and global markets, continues to challenge manufacturers as the pace of change and adoption of new standards increase.  Complex and changing international standards play to Lakeland’s strengths when compared to most multinationals or smaller manufacturers.  Lakeland currently sits on boards and/or works closely with groups involved in writing many international standards such as the American Society for Testing and Materials International (“ASTM”), the National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”), International Safety Equipment Association (“ISEA”), the European Committee for Standardization (“CEN”), the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), the China National Standards Board (“GB”) in China, and the Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand (“ASNZ”).
  
 Globally, not only are the standards continuing to change, but the focus of standards activity is shifting.  In response to increasing use of certification processes as a technical barrier to trade, standards writing bodies in the US and Europe have both concluded efforts to update and define conformity assessment (ANSI/ISEA 125 and the PPE Regulation respectively) within their own spheres of influence, unfortunately, these are not “international standards” and can be easily ignored by other countries who wish to impose their own conformity assessment systems on importers. The result is an increasingly dynamic standards environment where not only are the standards changing, but the minimum requirements for conformity with the certification process itself are changing. 
  
 A number of developing nations are now becoming active in their own standards development based on existing international standards.  However, we believe that the primary goal of their standards writing activity is not focused on worker protection (that is provided for by the use of international standards), rather they are attempting to establish their own certification criteria that will protect their domestic markets, or favor specific regional suppliers. This presents a new challenge in that not only are we faced with multiple test methods and standards, but we have the potential for multiple certification processes. While this adds to product development and sales expenses, the additional cost is only incremental. The real challenge is in navigating the certification process itself. Lakeland, by virtue of its international manufacturing and sales operations, is in a unique position to capitalize on this complex dynamic.

  Business Strategy 
  Key elements of our strategy include:  
 
   ●
 Increase International Sales Opportunities: In the past, we have aggressively sought to increase our penetration into international markets. We opened sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Weifang, China; Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina; and in Russia, India and Kazakhstan. We continue to believe in this strategy of aggressively penetrating international markets. Aiding our focus is the fact that many countries have adopted legislation similar to the 1970 US OSHA in order to facilitate their entry into the WTO which has, as a requisite for entry, worker safety laws (like OSHA), social security, environmental and tax laws similar to that of the USA and Europe. These new worker safety laws have driven the demand for our products in these growing economies. 

   ●
 Improve Marketing in Existing Markets: We believe significant growth opportunities are available to us through better branding, and enhanced cross-selling of our reusable woven protective clothing, glove and arm guards, reflective clothing, high-end chemical suit product lines and our limited use/disposable lines as a bundled offering.  This allows our customers one-stop shopping using combined freight shipments. As a manfacturer, Lakeland is uniquely positioned to offer one-stop shopping to multinational corporations via global contracts.


   ●
 Continued Emphasis on Customer Service. We continue to offer a high level of customer service to distinguish our products and to create customer loyalty. We offer well-trained and experienced sales and support personnel, on-time delivery and accommodation of custom and rush orders. We also seek to advertise our Lakeland branded tradenames and trademarks.


   ●
 Introduce New Products: We continued our history of product development and innovation by introducing new proprietary products across all our product lines. Last year we introduced our CleanMax line of clean and sterile manufactured garments for use in critical and aseptic work environments. We also continued the development and introduction of our utility/energy product line targeting electrical and gas distribution. These product rollouts will continue into FY 20 as we continue to ramp up manufacturing and add products to these lines.

 
 We own 20 patents on fabrics and production machinery, with one application in process, and continue to work on developing fabrics that could potentially lead us into new markets and channels. In North America, our growth strategy is to focus on key target sectors where we have advantages, and to increase our involvement at the end user level by adding sales personnel and enhancing our marketing and product training tools to make it easier for the sales teams of our distributors to be successful promoting our products.
  
 Our investment in a stronger sales team in Mexico is beginning to pay off with sales growth in manufacturing, particularly noticeable in the number of new automobile factories located in that country. We believe that as this growth continues, and Mexico will become a very important region for the Company, building on our competitive advantage of local manufacturing, provided that immigration issues do no cause disruptions. We have integrated the US, Canadian, and Mexican sales teams into one coordinated unit, a strategic recognition that the three countries are increasingly part of a great North American market with inter-related industries and companies throughout, and our sales teams are sharing opportunities with each other. We have experienced situations in which we could not break through with a company in one country, but the team in another country was able to make a conversion to our products. Then, after successful use of our products in one country, the doors open to us in the other.
  
 We continue to pursue conversion of end users to our products, based on our overall performance and prices. Our marketing is being significantly upgraded in terms of resources , better sales collateral materials, and increasingly effective use of social media. An example of this is the recent completion of a our new web site that meets our global marketing requirements. The Company plans to continue its efforts to align its global markets in terms of sales collateral, sales software, and e-commerce in the coming year and into the future.  
  
   ●
 Decrease Manufacturing Expenses by Opening New Manufacturing Facilites: We have successfully opened a new manufacturing facility in Vietnam and a pilot manufacturing facility in India in an effort to hedge against ever increasing manufacturing costs in China. Our China operation will continue for the foreseeable future to service products that are more complex and higher margin and for the manufacture of products for sale into China. Beginning in 1995, we successfully moved the labor-intensive sewing operations for our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines to facilities in Mexico and China. Manufacturing expansion is not only necessary to control rising costs, it is also necessary for Lakeland to achieve its growth objectives.


   ●
 We continue to press our raw material and component suppliers for price reductions and better payment terms.

   ●
 We are sourcing more raw materials and components from our China based operations as opposed to sourcing from Europe and North America.

   ●
 We are re-engineering many products to reduce the amount of raw materials used and reduce the direct labor required.

  Our Competitive Strengths
  Our competitive strengths include:
 
   ●
 Industry Reputation. We devote significant resources to creating customer loyalty and brand integrity by accommodating custom and rush orders and focusing on on-time delivery. Additionally, our ISO 9001 and 9002 certified facilities manufacture high-quality products. As a result of these factors, we believe that we have an excellent reputation in the industry.


   ●
 Technical Expertise: The breadth of the Company’s product lines, the raw materials used, the markets serviced and standards compliance globally, all contribute to a level of expertise and cross-functional knowledge that is unique in the industrial protective clothing market. Manufacturing our own products around the world for various global markets results in a body of knowledge that is not easiliy replicated. Lakeland’s knowledge of product design, technical fabrics and films, combined with market specific knowledge of standards, and the ability to navigate manufacturing in a number of different countries around the world provides synergies that few competitors can match.


   ●
 International Manufacturing Capabilities. We have operated our own manufacturing facilities in Mexico since 1995 and in China since 1996. In 2018, we commenced manufacturing operations in Vietnam and India. Our facilities in China in FY19 totaled 177,316 sq. ft. of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space, in Mexico totaled 74,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space, in Vietnam totaled 141,588 sq. ft of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space and in India totaled 32,905 sq ft of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space. Our facilities and capabilities in China, India, Mexico and Vietnam allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the US and permits us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than are available domestically.


   ●
 International Sales Offices. We have sales offices around the world to service various major markets, including offices in Toronto, Canada; Hull, UK; Beijing, Weifang, Chongqing and Shanghai, China; Melbourne, Australia; Southeast Asia: Noida, India; Santiago, Chile; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Jerez, Mexico; Moscow, Russia; and Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan.


   ●
 Comprehensive Inventory. We have a large product offering with numerous variants, such as size, hood design, elastic wrists and ankles, and pockets, and maintain a large inventory of each in order to satisfy customer orders in a timely manner. Many of our customers traditionally make purchases of industrial protective gear with expectation of immediate delivery. We believe our ability to provide timely service for these customers enhances our reputation in the industry and positions us strongly for repeat business, particularly in our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines.


   ●
 Manufacturing Flexibility. By locating labor-intensive manufacturing processes, such as sewing, in Mexico, China, Vietnam, and India, and by utilizing sewing subcontractors, we have the ability to increase production without substantial additional capital expenditures. Our manufacturing systems allow us flexibility for unexpected production surges and alternative capacity in the event any of our independent contractors become unavailable.

 Limited Use/Disposable Protective Clothing
  We manufacture a complete line of limited use/disposable protective garments, including coveralls, laboratory coats, shirts, pants, hoods, aprons, sleeves, arm guards, caps and smocks. Limited use garments can also be coated or laminated to increase splash protection against harmful inorganic acids, bases and other hazardous liquid and dry chemicals. Limited use garments are made from several different nonwoven fabrics. We use spunbonded polypropylene (SBPP), spundonded meltblow spunbond (SMS), hydroentangled woodpulp polyester, and needlepunched fabrics. We use these fabrics in combination with various film of varying composition, and/or topical chemical application to make our own trademarked fabrics, like Pyrolon® Plus 2, XT, CRFR, Micromax®, Micromax NS, Safegard®, Zonegard®, and ChemMax® 1, 2, and 3 as well as our patented Interceptor fabric. We incorporate many seaming, heat sealing and taping techniques depending on the level of protection needed in the end use application.
  
 Typical users of these garments include integrated oil/petrochemical refineries, chemical plants and related installations, automotive manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, construction companies, coal, gas and oil power generation utilities and telephone utility companies, laboratories, mortuaries and governmental entities. Numerous smaller industries use these garments for specific safety applications unique to their businesses. Additional applications include protection from viruses and bacteria, such as Ebola, AIDS, streptococcus, SARS and hepatitis at medical facilities, laboratories, and emergency rescue sites. Clean manufactured and sterilized versions of our MicroMAX NS product, trademarked CleanMax, is used in aseptic laboratories to protect both the wearer and the product from cross contamination.
  
 Our limited use/disposable protective clothing products range in unit price from $0.19 for shoe covers to approximately $6.00-$14.40 for a light duty ChemMax® 1 serged or sealed seam hooded and booted coverall. Our largest selling item, a standard white Micromax NS ANSI standard or CE standard coverall, sells for approximately $2.00 to $3.85 per garment. By comparison, similar reusable cloth coveralls range in price from $35.00 to $93.00, exclusive of laundering, maintenance and shrinkage expenses.
  
 We warehouse and distribute our limited use/disposable garments primarily from our Alabama, China, Vietnam and India facilities and secondarily from warehouses in the United Kingdom, Poland, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Kazakhstan, India, Australia, Texas and Nevada.  Fabrics are cut, sewn, assembled into finish garments and packaged at either our China, Mexico, Vietnam, or India facilities, then shipped to any of our regional warehouses or, in some cases, directly to our customers.

  High-End Chemical Protective Suits
  We manufacture and sell heavy duty chemical protective suits and protective apparel from our proprietary CRFR, ChemMax® 3, 4, Interceptor and other fabrics. These suits are worn by individuals on hazardous material teams and within general industry to provide protection from powerful, highly concentrated, toxic and/or potentially lethal chemicals and biological toxins. These suits are useful against toxic wastes at Superfund sites, toxic chemical spills or biological discharges, chemical or biological warfare weapons (such as sarin, anthrax or ricin and mustard gas) and chemicals and petro-chemicals present during the cleaning of refineries and nuclear facilities and protection from infectious diseases such as Avian Flu and Ebola. Our line of chemical protective clothing ranges in price from about $22 to $1,340 per garment. The chemical suits can be used in conjunction with a fire protective shell that we manufacture to protect the user from both chemical and flash fire hazards. We have also introduced two patented garments approved by the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) for varying levels of protection:
  
   ●
 Interceptor® is a patented fabric consisting of two multilayer films laminated on either side of durable nonwoven substrate. This garment provides a broad spectrum chemical barrier to gases, vapors and liquids. This garment is of an encapsulating design and is available in CE Type 1 certified configurations.

 
   ●
 ChemMax® 4 is a multilayer barrier film laminated to a durable nonwoven substrate. This garment is a broad spectrum chemical barrier, but its greatest advantage is that the material is strong enough to hold an airtight zipper and light enough to provide better range of motion than heavier fabrics. As a result, it provides a low cost option for encapsulating garments and is durable enough for multiple uses provided the garment is not exposed to chemical hazards. It is available in CE type 4 and 3 certified garments.

 
 The addition of Interceptor and ChemMax® 4 to our product line provides Lakeland with, what we believe to be, the most complete and cost-effective line of chemical protective garments available on the market today. Garments are certified to both NFPA and CE standards allowing us to offer products composed of these fabrics all over the world.
  
 We manufacture higher end chemical protective clothing with taped seams at our facilities in Mexico, China and in Alabama. Using fabrics, such as ChemMax® 1, ChemMax® 2, ChemMax® 3, ChemMax® 4 and Interceptor, we design, cut, sew and seal these materials to meet customer specifications.
 
  Firefighting and Heat Protective Apparel
  We manufacture an extensive line of UL/NFPA-certified structural firefighter protective apparel (turnout gear) for domestic and foreign fire departments. Our turnout gear is available both in standard stock patterns and custom configurations.
  
 We offer basic firefighter turnout gear in the Attack (A10) and Battalion (B1) styles. Introduced in 2013, are the Battalion (“B2”) style with advanced ergonomic features and the Stealth style, with innovative features new to the fire industry.
  
 We also manufacture each of the above styles in our UL/NFPA-certified Proximity line for Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (“ARFF”) with aluminized shells.
  
 We manufacture full lines of Fire service extrication suits in FR cotton, UL/NFPA-certified Wildland firefighting apparel in multiple fabrics and Aluminized Kiln entry/Approach suits to protect industrial workers from extreme heat.
  
 We manufacture fire suits at our facilities in China, Mexico and Alabama. Our fire suits range in price from about $800 for standard fire department turnout gear to $2,000 for custom gear. Our Lakeland Fire® brand of firefighting apparel continues to benefit from ongoing research and development investment, as we seek to address the ergonomic needs of stressful occupations.
 
  Reusable Woven Garments
  We manufacture and market a line of reusable, launderable woven garments that complement our firefighting and heat protective offerings and provide alternatives to our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines. These products provide us access to the much larger woven industrial and health care-related markets. Woven reusable garments are favored by customers for certain applications because of familiarity with and acceptance of these fabrics. These products allow us to supply and satisfy a wider range of safety and customer needs.

 Our product lines include the following:
 
   ●
 Electrostatic dissipative apparel used by electric and gas utilities.

   ●
 Flame resistant (FR) meta aramid and FR Cotton coveralls/pants/jackets used in petrochemical and refining operations.

   ●
 Cotton and Polycotton coveralls, lab coats, pants and shirts.

   ●
 FR fabrics containing blends of cotton, Modacrylic, meta aramid, para aramid, and viscose

 
 Our reusable woven garments range in price from $30 to $200 per garment. We manufacture woven garments at our facilities in China, Mexico, Argentina and Alabama. We are continuing to relocate highly repetitive sewing processes for our high volume, standard product lines, such as woven protective coveralls and flame retardant coveralls, to our facilities in China, Mexico, Vietnam and India where lower fabric and labor costs allow increased profit margins.
 
  High Visibility Clothing
  Lakeland’s High-Visibility Division manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of reflective apparel meeting the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements. The line includes vests, T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, coats, raingear, jumpsuits, hats and gloves.
  
 Fabrics available include solid and mesh fluorescent, polyester, both standard and FR treated and Modacrylic materials, which meet ASTM F1560 for standard NFPA 70E Electric Arc Protection, are part of our offering. The breathable Modacrylic fabric, has a strong appeal in regions where very hot weather affects utility workers during spring and summer (heat prostration).
  
 Our High Vis Polyurethane FR/ARC rated rainwear is light in weight, soft, flexible and provides a breathable, cooler garment. This product is intended for the Gas and Electrical Utility markets. The Lakeland ARC-X FR/PU garment exceeds all of the required ASTM arc flash and flash fire ratings for the Electric and Gas Utility market.
 
 Our vest production occurs in our facilities in Alabama, Mexico and China. Much of this manufacturing is for custom products. Many corporations and agencies, such as State Departments of Transportation, develop custom specifications which they feel are more efficient in meeting their specific needs versus an off-the-shelf product. We also can import a significant amount of product from China and Mexico to meet the demand for items in high volume commodity markets.
  
 In addition to ANSI Reflective items, Lakeland Hi-Visibility manufactures Nomex and FR cotton garments which have reflective trim attached as a part of their design criteria. These garments typically are used in rescue or extrication operations, such as those encountered as a result of vehicular accidents. Garments in this group are not as price sensitive as those in other reflective categories. Consequently, they are made in our facilities in Mexico, China and Alabama where we can customize the product to meet customer needs and offer quicker turnaround. Garments in this group can range in price from $200 to $360.
 
  Gloves and Sleeves
  We manufacture and sell specially designed glove and sleeve products made from Kevlar®, a cut and heat resistant fiber produced by DuPont, Spectra®, a cut resistant fiber made by Honeywell and our patented engineered yarns. We are one of only nine companies licensed in North America to sell 100% Kevlar® gloves, which are high strength, lightweight, flexible and durable. Kevlar® gloves offer a better overall level of protection and lower worker injury rate, and are more cost effective than traditional leather, canvas or coated work gloves. Kevlar® gloves, which can withstand temperatures of up to 400°F and are cut resistant enough to allow workers to safely handle sharp or jagged unfinished sheet metal, are used primarily in the automotive, glass and metal fabrication industries. Our higher end string knit gloves range in price from about $40 to $175 for a dozen pair. We manufacture these string knit gloves primarily at our Mexican facility, affording Lakeland lower production and labor costs.
 
 We have patents for our Despro® and Despro® Plus products that provide greater cut and abrasion hand protection to the areas of a glove where injury is most likely to occur. For example, the areas of the thumb crotch and index fingers are made heavier than the balance of the glove, providing increased wear protection and longer glove life, reducing overall glove costs. This proprietary manufacturing process allows us, to produce our gloves more economically and provide a greater value to our end user.

  Quality
  All of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9001 or 9002 certified. ISO standards are internationally recognized quality manufacturing standards established by the International Organization for Standardization based in Geneva, Switzerland. To obtain our ISO registration, our factories were independently audited to test our compliance with the applicable standards and norms. In order to maintain registration, our factories receive regular announced inspections by an independent certification organization. While ISO certification is advantageous in retaining CE certification of products, we believe that the ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 certifications make us more competitive in the marketplace, as customers increasingly recognize the standard as an indication of product quality.
  
 As we source more and more of our fabrics internationally, we have installed a quality control laboratory at our China facility. This laboratory is critical for ensuring that our incoming raw materials meet our quality requirements. We continue to add new capabilities to this facility to further guarantee product quality, to aid in new product development, and to meet the requirements for new products and markets.
  
 We have also added a test lab in Decatur, Alabama. This lab was completed in FY16 and mirrors our laboratory in China. It will be our primary facility to pre-test all NFPA certified garments.  This lab will ensure that garments submitted to Underwriter’s Laboratories (“UL”) for certification are assured to pass certification, thus reducing overall certification costs. 
 
  Marketing and Sales
  Domestically, we employ a field sales force in order to better support customers and enhance marketing. We further leverage our in-house sales team with 50 independent sales representatives. These employees and representatives call on over 1,600 industrial safety and fire service distributors nationwide to promote and sell our products. Distributors buy our products for resale and typically maintain inventory at the local level in order to assure quick response times and the ability to serve their customers properly. Our sales employees and independent representatives are in constant communication with decision makers at the end user and distribution levels, thereby allowing us valuable feedback on market perception of our products, as well as information about new developments in our industry.
  
 Internationally, Lakeland has sales representatives in 17 countries outside of the US and product sales in 50 or more countries.  Our sustainable market advantages continue to be our knowledge of global standards, the diversity of our product offering and the fact that we manufacture our own products. This provides our customers with high level product selection, quality, delivery and customer service. There are no customers who accounted for 10% of sales or more in FY19 and FY18.
  
 
 As a key competitive and marketing advantage, we manufacture nearly all the garments we sell in our own factories for better control of costs, quality and delivery. Our competitors rely largely on contractors, which is a major selling point in our favor, as customers are more comfortable dealing with the actual manufacturer. 
  
 We seek to maximize the efficiency of our established distribution network through direct promotion of our products at the end user level. We advertise primarily through trade publications, and our promotional activities include sales brochures, emails and our website. We exhibit at both regional and national trade shows, such as the National Safety Congress, the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE), the CIOSH, the COS+H and the A+A show in Dusseldorf, Germany.
  
  Product line expansion to higher value products is progressing in all markets and is contributing to increased brand recognition, sales growth and profitability. We believe that future international growth is still sustainable in the coming year, based on our current estimates of market penetration, the introduction of higher value products and the opportunity to open new markets in which we do not yet have a presence. 
 
  Suppliers and Materials
  Our largest supplier was Precision Fabrics Group from whom we purchased 7.63% and 10.5% of our total purchases in FY19 and FY18. Materials, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, spunlaced polyester, melt blown polypropylene and their derivatives and laminates, are available from 30 or more major mills. FR fabrics are also available from a number of both domestic and international mills. The accessories used in the production of our disposable garments, such as thread, boxes, snaps and elastics, are obtained from unaffiliated suppliers. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining our requirements for these commodity component items.

 We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining materials, including cotton, polyester and nylon, used in the production of reusable nonwovens and commodity gloves. We obtain Honeywell Spectra® yarn, used in our super cut-resistant Dextra Guard gloves, and Kevlar®, used in the production of our specialty safety gloves, from independent mills that purchase the fibers from Honeywell and DuPont, respectively.
 
 Materials used in our fire and heat protective suits include woven glass fabric, aluminized glass, Nomex®, aluminized Nomex®, Kevlar®, aluminized Kevlar® and polybenzimidazole, as well as combinations utilizing neoprene coatings. Traditional chemical protective suits are made of Viton®, butyl rubber and polyvinyl chloride, all of which are available from multiple sources. Advanced chemical protective suits are made from our proprietary ChemMax® 1, 2, 3, 4 and Interceptor®. We have not experienced difficulty obtaining any of these materials.

  Our business is highly competitive due to large competitors who have monopolistic positions in the fabrics that are standards in the industry for disposable and high-end chemical suits. We believe that the barriers to entry in the reusable garments and gloves industries are relatively low. We face competition in some of our other product markets from large established companies that have greater financial, research and development, sales and technical resources. Where larger competitors, such as DuPont, Kimberly Clark, Ansell and Honeywell, offer products that are directly competitive with our products, particularly as part of an established line of products, there can be no assurance that we can successfully compete for sales and customers. Larger competitors outside of our Disposable and Chemical Suit Lines also may be able to benefit from economies of scale and technological innovation and may introduce new products that compete with our products.
 Seasonality
  Our operations have historically been moderately seasonal, with higher sales generally occurring in March, April and May when scheduled maintenance on nuclear, coal, oil and gas fired utilities, chemical, petrochemical and smelting facilities, and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants occurs, primarily due to moderate spring temperatures and low Energy demands. Sales decline during the warmer summer vacation months and gradually increase from Labor Day through February with slight declines during holidays, such as Christmas. As a result of this seasonality in our sales, we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital, specifically inventories, with peak inventories occurring between December and May, coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules. We believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory, we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices, delivery times and quality standards differ.
 
 In recent years, due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear, our growing sales into the southern hemisphere, and our development of non-seasonal products like CleanMAX, our historical seasonal pattern has shifted. Governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns. Due to the size and timing of these governmental orders, our net sales, results of operations, working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods. As a result, we expect to experience increased variability in net sales, net income, working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis.
 
  Patents and Trademarks
  We own 20 patents and have one patent in the application and approval process with the US Patent and Trademark Office. We own 56 trademarks and have six trademarks in the application and approval process. Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets, trademarks and, to a lesser extent, copyrights. We maintain an active program to protect our technology by ensuring respect for our intellectual property rights.
 Employees
  As of January 31, 2019, we had 1,632 full-time employees, 1,530, or 94%, of who were employed in our international facilities, and 102, or 6%, of who were employed in our domestic facilities. An aggregate of approximately 1,232 of international employees are members of unions in their respective countries. We are not currently a party to any collective bargaining agreements or any other contracts with these unions. We believe our employee relations to be excellent.

  Environmental Matters
  We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection, chemical control, and health and safety laws and regulations, and we incur costs to comply with those laws. We own and lease real property, and certain environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property responsible for contamination on or originating from property, even if they did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. The presence of hazardous substances on any of our properties or the failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements could affect our ability to use or to sell the property or to use the property as collateral for borrowing, and could result in substantial remediation or compliance costs.
    
 Although we have not in the past had any material costs or damages associated with environmental claims or compliance, and we do not currently anticipate any such costs or damages, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur material costs or damages in the future as a result of the discovery of new facts or conditions, acquisition of new properties, the release of hazardous substances, a change in interpretation of existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws.
