ITEM 1. Business
Corporate Information
 
We originally incorporated as Micromed Laboratories, Inc. in 1999 under the laws of the State of California. We changed our name to Oculus Innovative Sciences, Inc. in 2001. In December 2006 we reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and in December 2016, we changed our name to Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1129 N. McDowell Blvd., Petaluma, California, 94954. We have two active wholly-owned subsidiaries: Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V., and Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Netherlands, B.V. Our fiscal year end is March 31. Our corporate telephone number is (707) 283-0550. Our website is www.sonomapharma.com. The website and any information contained therein or connected thereto is not intended to be incorporated into this report.
 
Overview
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to identifying, developing and commercializing unique, differentiated therapies to millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. We offer early-intervention relief with virtually no side-effects or contraindications. We believe our products, which are sold throughout the United States and internationally, have improved patient outcomes for more than six million patients by treating and reducing certain skin diseases including acne, atopic dermatitis, scarring, infections, itch, pain and harmful inflammatory responses. Our vision is to be a catalyst for improved care and increased access for all patients.
 
Business update
 
In December 2018, our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer resigned and we hired Bubba Sandford as Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. During his first three months in office, Mr. Sandford identified and implemented significant cost-cutting measures, including right-sizing the administrative headcount. While we incurred severance costs in this process, we believe the Company is set up for future success. We also are looking at streamlining and improving our production processes while creating efficiencies across the Company. Some of these measures showed early success in the first quarter of 2019 and we believe we will continue to show additional progress in our results of operations in fiscal year 2020. As part of the reorganization of Sonoma, in May 2019 we sold certain of our animal health product rights and assets for the Asian and European markets for $2.7 million. This is part of our strategic decision to focus on our core business of U.S. dermatology.

During fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and through June 20, 2019, we achieved several milestones;
 

· | Total revenues increased by 14% from $16.7 million in fiscal year 2018 to $19.0 million in fiscal year 2019; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Launched EpicynTM, a prescription topical cleanser which helps achieve clear skin and provide relief from irritation when used as part of a daily skin care regimen for patients with acute and chronic dermal lesions;
· | Right sized work force to fit current company needs; and 
· | Sold certain animal health product rights and assets for the Asian and European markets to Petagon, Limited for $2.7 million. 

Business Channels
 
Our core market differentiation is based on being the leading developer and producer of stabilized hypochlorous acid, or HOCl, solutions. HOCl is known to be among the safest and most-effective ways to relieve itch, inflammation and burns while stimulating natural healing through increased oxygenation and eliminating persistent microorganisms and biofilms.
 
Our core market includes patients who suffer from various skin diseases, including dermatoses, acne, scarring, skin-barrier and scaly skin conditions. Our secondary market includes eye-hygiene and acute care markets. These conditions impact patients worldwide who have had to live with less than optimal solutions or ones that come with significant side-effects. Skin conditions can have significant, multi-dimensional effects on quality of life, including on patient’s physical, functional and emotional well-being.
 
We have also built on our HOCl technology foundation by adding two complementary technology platforms: Lipogrid® Skin Barrier solutions and Exuvimax™ Skin de-scaling solutions. Lipogrid is a lipid structural matrix of solid lipid particles and vesicles containing phospholipids, ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol-type stabilizers that deliver building blocks to the dermis and protect the skin. Exuvimax contains a combination of dicaprylyl carbonate (Cetiol® Oil) and dimethicones that provide a patented formulation designed for a very effective but safe keratolytic effect which is the shedding of the top layer of skin. Our product Loyon® is based on the Exuvimax technology and its key benefit is to remove scale and therefore allow the topical treatments to work more effectively and faster on the underlying condition.
 
Dermatology
 
In the United States, we sell into dermatology markets with an in-house sales team that visits or calls dermatologists. Our dermatology products are primarily purchased by distributors, wholesalers, and pharmacies.
 
Although specific customer requirements can vary depending on applications, customers generally demand quality, innovation, affordability and clinically-supported efficacy. We have responded to these customer demands by introducing new products that treat persistent and common dermatological afflictions, as well as promote healing and improve results for patients opting for cosmetic dermatology procedures. We are strategically focused on introducing innovative new products that are supported by human clinical data with applications that address specific dermatological procedures currently in demand. In addition, we look for markets where we can provide effective product line extensions and pricing to new product families.
 
We seek to extend and expand our strong ongoing relationships with customers through new products, sales of existing products, ongoing training and support, and distribution of skincare products. We primarily target practitioners through office visits, workshops, trade shows, webinars and trade journals. We also market to potential patients through brochures, workshops and websites. In addition, we offer clinical forums with recognized expert panelists to promote advanced treatment.

Eye Care and Advanced Tissue Care
 
Our eye care and advanced tissue care products provide patients similar benefits to those in dermatology. We support the eye care and advanced tissue care markets with a dedicated in-house sales force and through an inside call center. We have also entered into strategic partnerships with respected and influential physicians and surgeons to promote our products. Our eye care products include prescription and dispensing solutions prescribed mainly by ophthalmologists and optometrists supported by pharmacies and, in some cases, sold through wholesale networks. Our tissue care products are primarily purchased by hospitals, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare practitioners.
Animal Health Care
 
Our animal healthcare products provide similar benefits to those in human dermatology. For our animal health products sold in the U.S. and Canada, we partnered with Manna Pro Products, LLC to bring relief to pets and peace of mind to their owners. Manna Pro distributes non-prescription products to national pet-store retail chains, farm animal specialty stores, farm animal veterinarians, grocery stores and mass retailers in the United States and Canada.
 
On May 20, 2019, we sold certain animal health product rights and assets for the Asian and European markets to Petagon, Limited, an international importer and distributor of quality pet food and products. The purchase price for the assets is $2,700,000. We agreed that we will continue to supply products to Petagon for five years at certain agreed upon transfer prices. The sale involves certain Asian patents and trademarks and the exclusive right to distribute animal health care products in Asia and Europe.
 
International
 
We sell products internationally through a worldwide distributor network in 48 countries. In these international markets, we have a network of partners, ranging from country specific distributors to large pharmaceutical companies and to full-service sales and marketing companies.
Europe
 
We rely on agreements with country-specific distributors for the sale of products in Europe, including Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Spain, Norway, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, Finland, Denmark, Montenegro and Serbia.
Mexico
 
On October 27, 2016, we sold certain parts of our Latin American business to Invekra S.A.P.I de C.V., an affiliate of Laboratorios Sanfer, with the ability of Invekra to set up its own manufacturing using some of our know-how and technology. During a transitional time period, we will provide technical assistance and supply products to Invekra at a reduced price from current list prices. We expect that revenues will decrease and cease if Laboratorios Sanfer begins to manufacture its own product. We are also entitled to receive a royalty of $2,500,000 to be paid in Mexican currency in quarterly installments over a period of ten years from closing as consideration for the provision of certain services and providing technical assistance, calculated as three per cent on net sales of certain products in Latin America, excluding Mexico. Since the $2,500,000 is to be paid in foreign currency, we may receive more or less than $2,500,000 due to currency fluctuations. During the year ended March 31, 2019, we received royalties of $250,000.

Rest of the World
 
Throughout the rest of the world, we use strategic partners and distributors for the sale of products into Brazil, South Korea, Japan, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, South Africa, Jordan and Lebanon.
 
On June 4, 2018, we entered into a 5-year exclusive license and distribution agreement with EMS S.A., headquartered in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Pursuant to the license and distribution agreement with EMS, we granted EMS the exclusive right to purchase, import, distribute, sell and promote certain of our dermatology products within Brazil for a period of five years, with the possibility of renewal. We also agreed to assign our trademarks filed or registered in Brazil to EMS on a royalty-free basis for the purpose of marketing, distributing, and selling our products in Brazil. EMS agreed to minimum annual purchase amounts of $100,000 in year one; $250,000 in year two; $500,000 in year three; $750,000 in year four; and $1,000,000 in year five, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2019, EMS purchased $586,000 of our products, exceeding the year one minimum annual purchase amount.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we employed a total of 62 full-time employees and one part-time employee in the United States and the Netherlands. Additionally, we had 191 employees in Mexico, all of which were contracted through an employment agency. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with employees are very good.

Research and Development
 
Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel expenses, clinical and regulatory services and supplies. For the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, research and development expense amounted to $1,518,000 and $1,575,000, respectively. None of these expenses were borne by our customers.
Manufacturing and Packaging
 
We manufacture products at facilities in Petaluma, California and Zapopan, Mexico. We have developed a manufacturing process and conduct quality assurance testing on each production batch in accordance with current U.S., Mexican and international Current Good Manufacturing Practices. Both facilities are required to meet and maintain regulatory standards applicable to the manufacture of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Our United States facilities are certified and comply with U.S. Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Systems Regulations for medical devices, and International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, guidelines. Our Mexican facility has been approved by the Ministry of Health and is also ISO 13485 certified.
 
Our machines are tested regularly, which is part of a validation protocol mandated by U.S., Mexican and international Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Quality Systems Regulation, and ISO requirements. This validation is designed to ensure that the final product is consistently manufactured in accordance with product specifications at all manufacturing sites. Certain materials and components used in manufacturing are proprietary to Sonoma.
 
We believe we own a sufficient number of machines to produce an adequate amount of product to meet anticipated future requirements for at least the next two years. With expansion into new geographic markets, we may establish additional manufacturing facilities to better serve those new markets.
 
U.S. Regulatory Approvals and Clearances
 
To date, we have obtained 21 U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearances permitting the sale of products as medical devices for Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States.
 
International Regulatory Approvals and Clearances
 
Outside the United States, we sell products for dermatological and advanced tissue care with a European Conformity marking, Conformité Européenne, or CE. These CEs cover 25 products in 47 countries with various approvals in Brazil, China, Southeast Asia, South Korea, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East.

Significant Customers
 
We rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of revenues. In the US, our key customers are pharmaceutical wholesalers, independent pharmacies, including AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal, that purchase our products and resell to retail pharmacies like CVS, Walgreens and Walmart. At March 31, 2019, no customer represented more than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance. For the year ended March 31, 2019, one customer represented 18%, and one customer represented 10% of net revenues. At March 31, 2018, one customer represented 36%, and one customer represented 18% of the net accounts receivable balance. For the year ended March 31, 2018, one customer represented 22%, one customer represented 19%, one customer represented 13%, and one customer represented 12% of net revenues.
Contract Testing
 
We also operate a microbiology contract testing laboratory division that provides consulting and laboratory services to medical companies that design and manufacture biomedical devices and drugs, as well as testing our current and potential products. This testing laboratory complies with U.S. Current Good Manufacturing Practices and Quality Systems Regulations.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on an ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for product technology and know-how, to operate without infringing proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We seek to protect a proprietary position by, among other methods, filing, when possible, U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a proprietary position.
 
As of June 13, 2019, we own a total of 76 issued patents, consisting of 15 issued U.S. patents and 61 issued foreign patents. We also have 17 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. All patent applications as well as issued patents are directed at our HOCl technology. The issued U.S. and foreign patents expire in 2022-2029.
 
In addition to our patents and applications, there is licensed technology developed in Japan relating to an electrolyzed water solution, methods of manufacture and electrolytic cell designs. This license includes three issued Japanese patents.
 
Although we work diligently to protect proprietary technology, there are no assurances that any patent will be issued from currently pending patent applications or from future patent applications. The scope of any patent protection may not exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages, and any patent may not be held valid if subsequently challenged, and others may claim rights in or ownership of patents and proprietary rights. Furthermore, others may develop products similar to ours and may duplicate any of the products or design around patents.
 
We have also filed for trademark protection for marks used with products in each of the following regions: United States, Europe, Canada, certain countries in Central and South America, including Mexico and Brazil, certain countries in the Middle East and certain countries in Asia, including Japan, China, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, India and Australia. In addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of technologies. Employees, consultants and advisors are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships. Employees, consultants and advisors with whom we expect to work with are also required to disclose and assign to us all inventions made in the course of a working relationship with them, while using intellectual property or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the products or to wrongfully obtain or use information that regarded as proprietary.

Competition
 
We compete globally across four main channels: dermatology, eye care, advanced tissue care and animal health with three main technology platforms: Stabilized Hypochlorous Acid, also referred to as HOCl Fast-Relief Technology, Lipogrid® Skin-Barrier Technology and Exuvimax™ Scale-Removal Technology.
Dermatology
 
Our dermatology products are at the forefront of HOCl-based solutions, a safe and highly effective active ingredient designed to relieve itching, burning and inflammation and acts as a highly effective antimicrobial agent. We believe no other solutions on the market provide the same patient benefits at the levels of safety and cost. Our HOCl-based solutions face significant competition in the United States from prescription products including corticosteroids, topical steroids and topical antibiotics. Our opportunity as an adjunct to these steroids is based on the insight that many doctors and patients limit steroid and antibiotic use due to potential side effects. These side effects include bacterial resistance, stinging, burning and inflammation for topical antibiotics and stretch marks, easy bruising, tearing of the skin and, to a lesser extent, enlarged of blood vessels for topical steroids. Our HOCl-based products are safe, non-toxic and have shown few side effects in clinical studies.
Advanced Tissue Care Markets
 
Similar to our dermatology products, our HOCl-based advanced tissue care solutions provide improved efficacy at low costs than traditional acute care products. Our HOCl-based solutions compete with topical anti-infectives and antibiotics, as well as some advanced wound technologies, such as skin substitutes, growth factors and delayed release silver-based dressings. Our opportunity in this space relative to antibiotics is based on the insight that competing antibiotic solutions may have resistance-building properties.
Factors Affecting Competitive Position
 
While some other companies are able to produce small molecule, HOCl-based formulations, based on our research, their products may become unstable after a relatively short period of time or have large ranges of effectiveness. We believe our HOCl-based solutions are among the most stable therapeutics available.
 
Some of the competitors in the dermatology, advanced tissue care markets and animal health care enjoy several competitive advantages. These include:
 

· | greater name recognition; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | established relationships with healthcare professionals, patients and third-party payors; 
· | established distribution networks; 
· | additional product lines and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives; 
· | experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing; and
· | financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patient support. 

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, biologics and medical devices. All of our products in development will require regulatory approval or clearance by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. Various federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations also govern testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, distribution and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and clearances, and the subsequent process of maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals.

Medical Device Regulation
 
To date, we have received 21 510(k) clearances for use of products as medical devices in tissue care management, such as cleaning, debridement, lubricating, moistening and dressing, including for acute and chronic wounds, and in dermatology applications. Any future product candidates or new applications classified as medical devices will require clearance by the FDA.
 
Medical devices are subject to FDA clearance and extensive regulation under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. The classification of a device into one of these three classes generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices may also be designated unclassified. Unclassified devices are legally marketed pre-amendment devices for which a classification regulation has yet to be finalized and for which a pre-market approval is not required.
 
Class I devices are devices for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to a set of general controls. These general controls include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements; facility registration, device listing and product reporting of adverse medical events; truthful and non-misleading labeling; and promotion of the device only for its cleared or approved intended uses. Class II devices are also subject to these general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is typically accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. When 510(k) clearance is sought, a sponsor must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, then 510(k) clearance to market will be granted. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a pre-market approval.
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a pre-market approval application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. These trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption. An investigational device exemption must be supported by pre-clinical data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, which show that the device is safe to test in humans and that the study protocols are scientifically sound. The FDA must approve an investigational device exemption, in advance, for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements.
 
Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which sets forth the Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use.
 
FDA regulations prohibit the advertising and promotion of a medical device for any use outside the scope of a 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval or for unsupported safety or effectiveness claims. Although the FDA does not regulate physicians’ practice of medicine, the FDA does regulate manufacturer communications with respect to off-label use.

--

 

If the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with FDA laws and regulations or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions such as:
 

· | imposing fines, injunctions and civil penalties 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | requiring a recall or seizure of products 
· | implementing operating restrictions, which can include a partial suspension or total shutdown of production
· | refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products 
· | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval approvals already granted 
· | criminal prosecution 

 
The FDA also has the authority to require a company to repair, replace, or refund the cost of any medical device.
 
The FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA clearance are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, each foreign country subjects such medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the European Union, there is a single regulatory approval process and approval is represented by the presence of a CE marking.
 
Other Regulation in the United States
 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act signed into law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of medical devices, drugs, biologicals, and medical supplies to track and report certain payments made to and transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as to report certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. These manufacturers must report annually to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services any direct or indirect payments and transfers of value of $10 or more, or annual aggregate of $100 or more, made to physicians or to a third party at the request of or on behalf of a physician, including dentists. Payment includes: consulting fees, compensation for services other than consulting, honoraria, gifts, entertainment, food, travel (including the specified destinations), education, research, charitable contribution, royalty or license, current or prospective ownership or investment interest, direct compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for a medical education program, grants, any other nature of the payment, or other transfer of value. Manufacturers face monetary penalties for non-compliance. Certain payments related to research must be reported separately. Product samples intended for patient use need not be reported.
Health Care Coverage and Reimbursement by Third-Party Payors
 
Commercial success in marketing and selling products depends, in part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party health care payors, such as government and private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States. These changes are causing the marketplace to be more cost-conscious and focused on the delivery of more cost-effective medical products. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies, and managed-care plans control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or treatments. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products. Some third-party payors also require that a favorable coverage determination be made for new or innovative medical devices or therapies before they will provide reimbursement of those medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical product may have been cleared or approved for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the product until adequate coverage and reimbursement have been obtained from governmental and other third-party payors.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, which, among other things, prohibit the offer or acceptance of remuneration intended to induce or in exchange for the purchase of products or services reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and the submission of false or fraudulent claims with the government. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and comparable state laws. These laws regulate the activities of entities involved in the healthcare industry, such as Sonoma, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements such entities may have with healthcare providers who use or recommend the use of medical products, including, for example, sales and marketing programs, advisory boards and research and educational grants. In addition, in order to ensure that healthcare entities comply with healthcare laws, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that healthcare entities institute effective compliance programs. To assist in the development of effective compliance programs, the Office of Inspector General has issued model Compliance Program Guidance, materials for a variety of healthcare entities which, among other things, identify practices to avoid that may implicate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and other relevant laws and describes elements of an effective compliance program. While compliance with the Compliance Program Guidance materials is voluntary, a California law requires pharmaceutical and devices manufacturers to initiate compliance programs that incorporate the Compliance Program Guidance and the July 2002 Pharmaceuticals Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals.
 
Due to the scope and breadth of the provisions of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our practices might be challenged by the government under one or more of these laws in the future. Violations of these laws, which are discussed more fully below, can lead to civil and criminal penalties, damages, imprisonment, fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Anti-Kickback Laws
 
Our operations are subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual for a good or service reimbursed under a federal healthcare program, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waiver of co-payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Because the Anti-Kickback Statute makes illegal a wide variety of common, even beneficial, business arrangements, the Office of Inspector General was tasked with issuing regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors,” that describe arrangements where the risk of illegal remuneration is minimal. As long as all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor are strictly met, the entity engaging in that activity will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the Office of Inspector General. Our agreements to pay compensation to our advisory board members and physicians who provide other services for we may be subject to challenge to the extent they do not fall within relevant safe harbors under state and federal anti-kickback laws. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by Medicaid, and some have adopted such laws with respect to private insurance. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to significant fines and penalties and may lead to a company being excluded from participating in federal health care programs.

False Claims Laws
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly filing a false claim, knowingly causing the filing of a false claim, or knowingly using false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Certain violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute per se violations of the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, such suits are known as “qui tam” actions. Individuals may file suit on behalf of the government and share in any amounts received by the government pursuant to a settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, where the federal government created financial incentives for states to enact false claims laws consistent with the federal False Claims Act. As more states enact such laws, we expect the number of qui tam lawsuits to increase. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend false claims actions, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state government healthcare programs as a result of investigations arising out of such actions.
HIPAA
 
Two federal crimes were created under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
Health Information Privacy and Security
 
Individually, identifiable health information is subject to an array of federal and state regulation. Federal rules promulgated pursuant to HIPAA regulate the use and disclosure of health information by “covered entities.” Covered entities include individual and institutional health care providers from which we may receive individually identifiable health information. These regulations govern, among other things, the use and disclosure of health information for research purposes, and require the covered entity to obtain the written authorization of the individual before using or disclosing health information for research. Failure of the covered entity to obtain such authorization could subject the covered entity to civil and criminal penalties. We may experience delays and complex negotiations in dealing with each entity’s differing interpretation of the regulations and what is required for compliance. Also, where our customers or contractors are covered entities, including hospitals, universities, physicians or clinics, we may be required by the HIPAA regulations to enter into “business associate” agreements that subject the company to certain privacy and security requirements. In addition, many states have laws that apply to the use and disclosure of health information, and these laws could also affect the manner in which we conduct research and other aspects of business. Such state laws are not preempted by the federal privacy law when such laws afford greater privacy protection to the individual than the federal law. While activities to assure compliance with health information privacy laws are a routine business practice, we are unable to predict the extent to which resources may be diverted in the event of an investigation or enforcement action with respect to such laws.
Foreign Regulation
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, approval of a product by the applicable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries can begin. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country. Although governed by the applicable country, clinical trials conducted outside of the United States typically are administered under a three-phase sequential process similar to that discussed above for medical devices.

European Union Regulation
 
Medical Device Regulation
 
Our products are classified as medical devices in the European Union. In order to sell medical device products within the European Union, we are required to comply with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, and its national implementations, including affixing CE markings on products. The CE marking indicates a product’s compliance with EU legislation and so enables the sale of products throughout the European Economic Area, or the EEA, comprising the 28 Member States of the EU and European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, countries Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. In order to comply with the Medical Devices Directive, we must meet certain requirements relating to the safety and performance of products and, prior to marketing products, we must successfully undergo verification of products’ regulatory compliance, or conformity assessment.
 
On May 26, 2017, the new Medical Devices Directive became effective in the EEA, becoming fully applicable after a transition period of three years, on May 26, 2020. Under the new Medical Devices Directive, certain devices will be classified in higher classes, new devices will become classified, and certain new obligations are imposed on manufacturers and distributors. Manufacturers will be required to engage a medical device expert and carry insurance for possible liability claims. In addition, the pre-market approval and post-market surveillance requirements were enhanced. The European Database for Medical Devices, or Eudamed, will hold and publish information on medical devices collected from the European Commission and the national authorities.
 
Medical devices are divided into three regulatory classes: Class I, Class IIB and Class III. The nature of the conformity assessment procedures depends on the regulatory class of the product. In order to comply with the examination, we completed, among other things, a risk analysis and presented clinical data, which demonstrated that our products met the performance specifications claimed by us, provided sufficient evidence of adequate assessment of unwanted side effects and demonstrated that the benefits to the patient outweigh the risks associated with the device. We are subject to continued supervision and are required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We are also required to comply with additional national requirements that are beyond the scope of the Medical Devices Directive.
 
We received a CE certificate for 25 of its Class IIB medical devices, which allows us to affix CE markings on these products and sell them in Europe. We may not be able to maintain the requirements established for CE markings for any or all of our products or be able to produce these products in a timely and profitable manner while complying with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and other regulatory requirements.
 
European Good Manufacturing Process
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and clinical trial supplies is subject to good manufacturing practice as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines. Compliance with good manufacturing practice is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. They may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
Mexican Regulation
 
The Ministry of Health is the authority in charge of sanitary controls in Mexico. Sanitary controls are a group of practices related to the orientation, education, testing, verification and application of security measures and sanctions exercised by the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the issuance of Official Mexican Standards and specifications for drugs subject to the provisions of the General Health Law, which govern the process and specifications of drugs, including the obtaining, preparing, manufacturing, maintaining, mixing, conditioning, packaging, handling, transporting, distributing, storing and supplying of products to the public at large. In addition, a medical device is defined as a device that may contain antiseptics or germicides used in surgical practice or in the treatment of continuity solutions, skin injuries or its attachments.

Under the General Health Law, a business that manufactures drugs is either required to obtain a “Sanitary Authorization” or to file an “Operating Notice.” Our Mexican subsidiary, Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V., is considered a business that manufactures medical devices and therefore is not subject to a Sanitary Authorization, but rather only required to file an Operating Notice.
 
In addition to its Operating Notice, our Mexico subsidiary has obtained a “Good Processing Practices Certificate” issued by Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks, which demonstrates that the manufacturing at our facility located in Zapopan, Mexico, operates in accordance with the applicable official standards.
 
In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States, which could result in lengthy negotiations delaying our ability to commercialize products. We face the risk that the prices which result from the regulatory approval process would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return.
