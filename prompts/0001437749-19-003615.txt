General
 
We are a television broadcast company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, that is one of the largest owners of television (“TV”) stations and digital assets in the United States. Currently, we own and operate television stations in 91 television markets broadcasting almost 400 separate program streams including nearly 150 affiliates of the ABC Network (“ABC”), the NBC Network (“NBC”), the CBS Network (“CBS”) and the FOX Network (“FOX”). We refer to these major broadcast networks collectively as the “Big Four” networks. Our television stations ranked first or second among all local television stations in 86 of our 91 markets between December 2017 and November 2018. Our station portfolio reaches approximately 24% of total United States television households. We also own video program production, marketing, and digital businesses including Raycom Sports, Tupelo-Raycom, and RTM Studios, the producer of PowerNation programs and content.
 
Our operating revenues are derived primarily from broadcast and internet advertising and from retransmission consent fees. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 our revenues were $1,084.1 million, $882.7 million and $812.5 million, respectively.
 
Acquisition of Raycom Media, Inc. and Related Transactions
 
On January 2, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Raycom Media, Inc. (“Raycom”). In addition, we acquired television stations KYOU-TV in the Ottumwa, Iowa / Kirksville, Missouri market and WUPV-TV in the Richmond/Petersburg, Virginia market that Raycom had previously agreed to acquire. In connection with these transactions, we also completed the divestitures of nine television stations in overlap markets to satisfy the conditions placed on these transactions by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”). Together we refer to these transactions as the “Raycom Merger.” In addition, immediately prior to the closing of the Raycom Merger, Raycom completed the spin-offs to its shareholders of two of its wholly owned subsidiaries, CNHI, LLC and PureCars Automotive, LLC.
 
The Raycom Merger completed our transformation from a small, regional broadcaster to a leading media company with nationwide scale based on high-quality stations with exceptional talent in attractive markets. By combining these two great companies, we now own and operate television stations and leading digital properties in television markets from Alaska and Hawaii to Maine and Florida.

Markets and Stations
 
In the year ended December 31, 2018, we operated exclusively in television markets below the top 50 largest designated market areas (“DMAs”). Beginning on January 2, 2019, with the completion of the Raycom Merger, we operate television stations in 34 additional markets, including eight stations in DMAs larger than the top 50 television markets. We believe a key driver for our strong market position both in the past and in the future is our focus on strong local news and information programming. We believe that our market position and our strong local teams have enabled us to maintain more stable revenues compared to many of our peers.
 
We are diversified across our markets and network affiliations. In 2018 and 2017, our largest market by revenue was Springfield, Missouri, which contributed approximately 5% of our revenue each year. Our top 10 markets by Company revenue contributed approximately 32% and 30% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our NBC-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 33% of our revenue in each year; our CBS-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 36% of our revenue in each year; our ABC-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 18% of our revenue in each year; and our FOX-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 4% of our revenue.
 
In each of our markets, we own and operate at least one television station broadcasting a primary channel affiliated with one of the Big Four networks. We also own additional stations in some markets, some of which also broadcast primary channels affiliated with one of the Big Four networks. Nearly all of our stations also broadcast secondary digital channels that are affiliated with various networks, or are independent of any network. The terms of our affiliations with broadcast networks are governed by network affiliation agreements. Each network affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network. Our network affiliation agreements with the Big Four broadcast networks currently expire at various dates through December 2023.
 
Television Industry Background
 
The FCC grants broadcast licenses to television stations. There are only a limited number of broadcast licenses available in any one geographic area. Each commercial television station in the United States is assigned to one of 210 DMAs. These markets are ranked in size according to their number of television households, with the market having the largest number of television households ranked number one (New York City). Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties (and in some cases, portions of counties) in which the home-market commercial television stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours.
 
Television station revenue is derived primarily from local, regional and national advertising revenue and retransmission consent fees. Television station revenue is also derived to a much lesser extent from studio and tower space rental fees and production activities. “Advertising” refers primarily to advertisements broadcast by television stations, but it also includes advertisements placed on a television station’s website and sponsorships of television programming and off-line content (such as email messages, mobile applications, and other electronic content distributed by stations). Advertising rates are generally based upon: (i) the size of a station’s market, (ii) a station’s overall ratings, (iii) a program’s popularity among targeted viewers, (iv) the number of advertisers competing for available time, (v) the demographic makeup of the station’s market, (vi) the availability of alternative advertising media in the market, (vii) the presence of effective sales forces and (viii) the development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming and/or digital content on a station’s website or mobile applications.

Advertising rates can also be determined in part by a station’s overall ratings and in-market share, as well as the station’s ratings and market share among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting. Because broadcast stations rely on advertising revenues, they are sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy. The sizes of advertisers’ budgets, which can be affected by broad economic trends, can affect the broadcast industry in general and the revenues of individual broadcast television stations.
 
Strategy
 
Our success is based on the following strategies:
 
Grow by Leveraging our Diverse National Footprint. We serve a diverse and national footprint of television stations. We currently operate in DMAs ranked between 11 and 209. We seek to operate in markets that we believe have the potential for significant political advertising revenue in periods leading up to elections. We are also diversified across our broadcast programming.
Maintain and Grow our Market Leadership Position. Based on the consolidated results of the December 2017 through November 2018 ratings periods, our owned and operated television stations achieved the #1 ranking in overall audience in 66 of our 91 markets. In addition, our stations achieved the #1 or #2 ranking in overall audience in 86 of our 91 markets.
 
We believe there are significant advantages in operating the #1 or #2 television broadcasting stations in a local market. Strong audience and market share allows us to enhance our advertising revenue through price discipline and leadership. We believe a top-rated news platform is critical to capturing incremental sponsorship and political advertising revenue. Our high-quality station group allows us to generate higher operating margins, which allows us additional opportunities to reinvest in our business to further strengthen our network and news ratings. Furthermore, we believe operating the top ranked stations in our various markets allows us to attract and retain top talent.
 
We also believe that our local market leadership positions help us in negotiating more beneficial terms in our major network affiliation agreements, which expire at various dates through December 2023, and in our syndicated programming agreements. These leadership positions also give us additional leverage to negotiate retransmission contracts with cable system operators, telephone video distributors, direct broadcast satellite (or “DBS”) operators, and other multichannel video programming distributors (or “MVPDs”).
 
We intend to maintain our market leadership position through continued prudent investment in our news and syndicated programs, as well as continued technological advances and workflow improvements. We expect to continue to invest in technological upgrades in the future. We believe the foregoing will help us maintain and grow our market leadership; thereby enhancing our ability to grow and further diversify our revenues and cash flows.
 
Continue to Pursue Strategic Growth and Accretive Acquisition Opportunities. Over the last several years, the television broadcasting industry has been characterized by a high level of acquisition activity. We believe that there are a number of television stations, and a few station groups, that have attractive operating profiles and characteristics, and that share our commitment to local news coverage in the communities in which they operate and to creating high-quality and locally-driven content. On a highly selective basis, we may pursue opportunities for the acquisition of additional television stations or station groups that fit our strategic and operational objectives, and where we believe that we can improve revenue, efficiencies and cash flow through active management and cost controls. As we consider potential acquisitions, we primarily evaluate potential station audience and revenue shares and the extent to which the acquisition target would positively impact our existing station operations. Consistent with this strategy, from October 31, 2013 through December 31, 2018, we completed 23 acquisition transactions and four divestiture transactions. These transactions added a net total of 50 television stations in 31 television markets, including 28 new television markets, to our operations. For more information on these transactions see Note 3 “Acquisitions and Dispositions” of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. This note also describes the stations we acquired in each of 2017 and 2016, which we may also refer to collectively as our “acquisitions,” our “recent acquisitions” or “the acquisitions.”

On January 2, 2019, we completed the Raycom Merger. Giving effect to the Raycom Merger, including divestitures of stations due to market overlaps, we now own and/or operate television stations and leading locally focused digital platforms in 34 additional markets. In addition to high quality television stations, as part of the Raycom Merger, we acquired businesses that provide sports marketing and production services, that we believe have made us a more diversified media company.
 
Continue to Monetize Digital Spectrum. In addition to each of our station’s primary channel, we also broadcast a number of secondary channels. Certain of our secondary channels are affiliated with more than one network simultaneously. Our strategy includes expanding upon our digital offerings and sales. We also evaluate opportunities to use spectrum for future delivery of data to mobile devices using a new transmission standard.
Continue to Maintain Prudent Cost Management. Historically, we have closely managed our costs to maintain and improve our margins. We believe that our market leadership position provides us additional negotiating leverage to enable us to lower our syndicated programming costs. We have increased the efficiency of our stations by automating video production and back office processes. We believe that we will be able to further benefit from our cost and operational efficiencies as we continue to grow.
Further Strengthen our Balance Sheet. During the last several years, we have leveraged our strong cash flow and efficient operating model to grow our diverse national footprint. In recent years, we acted to improve the terms of our debt by amending or replacing our long-term debt in order to lock in more attractive terms while interest rates are at historically low levels. During 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 17.25 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $14.50 per share. The net proceeds of the offering were $238.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses. We completed the Raycom Merger using a financing plan composed of combination of our cash on hand, common stock, preferred stock, attractively priced fixed rate debt and an amended term loan facility. We continually evaluate opportunities to improve our balance sheet.

Cyclicality, Seasonality and Revenue Concentrations
 
Broadcast stations like ours rely on advertising revenue and are therefore sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy. Our political advertising revenue is generally not as significantly affected by economic slowdowns or recessions as our non-political advertising revenue.
 
 10



Broadcast advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year. This seasonality results partly from increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the Christmas holiday season. Broadcast advertising revenue is also typically higher in even-numbered years due to spending by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups during the “on year” of the two-year election cycle. This political advertising spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter. In addition, the broadcast of Olympic Games by our NBC-affiliated stations during even-numbered years generally leads to increased viewership and revenue during those years.
 
Our broadcast advertising revenue is earned from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016, we derived a material portion of our non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 25%, 25% and 22%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our customers in the automotive industry. Revenue from this industry may represent a higher percentage of total revenue in odd-numbered years due to, among other things, the increased availability of advertising time, as a result of such years being the “off year” of the two year election cycle.
 
Station Network Affiliations. In addition to affiliations with ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX, our secondary channels are affiliated with numerous smaller networks and program services including, among others, the CW Network or the CW Plus Network (collectively, “CW”), MY Network (“MY” or “My Network”), the MeTV Network, This TV Network, Antenna TV, Telemundo (“Tel.”), Cozi, Heroes and Icons and MOVIES! Network. Certain of our secondary digital channels are affiliated with more than one network simultaneously. We also broadcast independent and local news/weather channels in some markets.
 
The Big Four major broadcast networks dominate broadcast television in terms of the amount of viewership that their original programming attracts. The “Big Three” major broadcast networks of CBS, NBC, and ABC provide their respective network affiliates with a majority of the programming broadcast each day. FOX and CW provide their affiliates with a smaller portion of each day’s programming compared to the Big Three networks. The CW Plus Network generally provides programming for the entire broadcast day for CW affiliates in markets smaller than the top 100 DMAs.
 
We believe most successful commercial television stations obtain their brand identity from locally produced news programs. Notwithstanding this, however, the affiliation of a station’s channels with one of the Big Four major networks can have a significant impact on the station’s programming, revenues, expenses and operations. A typical network provides an affiliate with network programming in exchange for a substantial majority of the advertising time available for sale during the airing of the network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate sells the remaining advertising time available within the network programming and non-network programming, and the affiliate retains most or all of such revenue from these sales. In seeking to acquire programming to supplement network-supplied programming, which we believe is critical to maximizing affiliate revenue, affiliates compete primarily with other affiliates and independent stations in their markets as well as, in certain cases, various national non-broadcast networks (“cable networks”) that present competitive programming. The Big Four networks and CW charge fees to their affiliates for receiving network programming.
 
A television station may also acquire programming through barter arrangements. Under a programming barter arrangement, a national program distributor retains a fixed amount of advertising time within the program in exchange for the programming it supplies. The television station may pay a fixed fee for such programming.
 
 11



We record revenue and expense for trade transactions involving the exchange of tangible goods or services with our customers. The revenue is recorded at the time the advertisement is broadcast and the expense is recorded at the time the goods or services are used. The revenue and expense associated with these transactions are based on the fair value of the assets or services received.
 
We do not account for barter revenue and related barter expense generated from syndicated programming as such amounts are not material. Furthermore, any such barter revenue recognized would then require the recognition of an equal amount of barter expense. The recognition of these amounts would not have a material effect upon net income.
 
Affiliates of FOX and CW must purchase or produce a greater amount of programming for their non-network time periods, generally resulting in higher programming costs. However, affiliates of FOX, and CW retain a larger portion of their advertising time inventory and the related revenues compared to Big Three affiliates.
 
Competition 
 
Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Cable network programming is a significant competitor of broadcast television programming. No single cable network regularly attains audience levels of those of any major broadcast network. Cable networks’ advertising share has increased due to the growth in the number of homes that subscribe to a pay-TV service from MVPDs. Despite increasing competition from cable channels, digital platforms, social media, and internet-delivered video channels, television broadcasting remains the dominant distribution system for mass-market television advertising. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position.
Audience. Stations compete for audience based on broadcast program popularity, which has a direct effect on advertising rates. Networks supply a substantial portion of our affiliated stations’ daily programming. Affiliated stations depend on the performance of the network programs to attract viewers. There can be no assurance that any such current or future programming created by our affiliated networks will achieve or maintain satisfactory viewership levels. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of locally produced news, public affairs and entertainment programming, including national news or syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and barter, or barter only.
 
MVPD systems have significantly altered the competitive landscape for audience in the television industry. Specifically, MVPD systems can increase a broadcasting station’s competition for viewers by bringing into the market both cable networks and distant television station signals not otherwise available to the station’s audience.
 
Other sources of competition for audiences, programming and advertisers include internet websites, mobile applications and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems.
 
Recent developments by many companies, including internet service providers and internet website operators have expanded, and are continuing to expand, the variety and quality of broadcast and non-broadcast video programming available to consumers via the internet. Internet companies have developed business relationships with companies that have traditionally provided syndicated programming, network television and other content. As a result, additional programming has, and is expected to further become, available through non-traditional methods, which can directly impact the number of TV viewers, and thus indirectly impact station rankings, popularity and revenue possibilities of our stations.
 
 12



Programming. Competition for non-network programming involves negotiating with national program distributors, or syndicators, that sell “first run” and “off network” or rerun programming packages. Each station competes against the other broadcast stations in its market for exclusive access to first run programming (such as Wheel of Fortune) and off network reruns (such as Seinfeld). Broadcast stations also compete for exclusive news stories and features. While cable networks or internet service providers generally do not compete with local stations for programming, some national cable networks or internet service providers from time to time have acquired programs that would have been offered to, or otherwise might have been broadcast by, local television stations.
 
Advertising. Advertising revenues comprise the primary source of revenues for our stations. Our stations compete with other television stations for advertising revenues in their respective markets. Our stations also compete for advertising revenue with other media, such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories, direct mail, internet websites, and local cable and other MVPD systems. In the broadcast industry, advertising revenue competition occurs primarily within individual markets.
Federal Regulation of the Television Broadcast Industry 
 
General. Under the Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”), television broadcast operations such as ours are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC. Among other things, the Communications Act empowers the FCC to: (i) issue, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; (ii) regulate stations’ operations and equipment; and (iii) impose penalties for violations of the Communications Act or FCC regulations. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of a licensee without prior FCC approval.
License Grant and Renewal. The FCC grants broadcast licenses to television stations for terms of up to eight years. Broadcast licenses are of paramount importance to the operations of television stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a licensee’s broadcast license if the FCC finds that: (i) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations; and (iii) there have been no other violations which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. Historically the FCC has renewed broadcast licenses in substantially all cases. While we are not currently aware of any facts or circumstances that might prevent the renewal of our stations’ licenses at the end of their respective license terms, we cannot provide any assurances that any license will be renewed. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended pending the FCC’s processing of a renewal application. For further information regarding the expiration dates of our stations’ current licenses and renewal application status, see the table under the heading “Markets and Stations.”
Media Ownership Restrictions and FCC Proceedings. The FCC’s broadcast ownership rules affect the number, type and location of broadcast properties that we may hold or acquire. The FCC adopted significant changes to its ownership rules, which took effect in February 2018. The new rules will continue to limit the common ownership, operation or control of, and “attributable” interests or voting power in, television stations serving the same area. The current rules limit the aggregate national audience reach of television stations that may be under common ownership, operation and control, or in which a single person or entity may hold an official position or have more than a specified interest or percentage of voting power. The FCC’s rules also define the types of positions and interests that are considered attributable for purposes of the ownership limits, and thus also apply to our principals and certain investors.
 
 13



The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules every four years to determine if such rules remain necessary in the public interest. In November 2017, the FCC released an Order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules. Specifically, the Order (i) eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, (ii) eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule, (iii) loosened the existing rules governing ownership of local television stations as described above and (iv) reversed the FCC’s earlier decision to treat television joint sales agreements as attributable ownership interests. In December 2018, the FCC began the new quadrennial review of its ownership rules. In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”), the FCC is seeking comments on competition in the local television marketplace, including: (i) whether its current two-stations to a market limit should be relaxed or tightened, (ii) whether it should modify its general prohibition on owning two stations ranked among the Top-Four in a market, (iii) if the FCC’s television market analysis should consider the factors the DOJ applies to local television issues, (iv) how the FCC should evaluate competition among television stations.
 
Local TV Ownership Rules. The FCC’s current television ownership rules allow one entity to own two commercial television stations in a DMA as long as the specified service contours of the stations do not overlap or, if they do, at least one of the stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA (the “Top Four Prohibition”). Under its rules adopted in November 2017, the Commission will consider requests for waiver of the Top Four Prohibition on a case-by-case basis.
National Television Station Ownership Rule. The maximum percentage of U.S. households that a single owner can reach through commonly owned television stations is 39 percent. This limit was specified by Congress in 2004. The FCC applies a 50 percent “discount” for ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) stations. In December 2017, the Commission issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF discount.
Conclusion. The FCC’s media ownership proceedings are on-going and, in many cases, are or will be subject to further judicial and potentially Congressional review. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these current or potential proceedings.
Attribution Rules. Under the FCC’s ownership rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of certain types of our securities could violate FCC regulations if that purchaser owned or acquired an “attributable” interest in other television properties in the same areas as one or more of our stations. Pursuant to FCC rules, the following relationships and interests are generally considered attributable for purposes of television broadcast ownership restrictions: (i) all officers and directors of a corporate licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s); (ii) voting stock interests of at least five percent; (iii) voting stock interests of at least 20 percent, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (such as an investment company, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, bank, or insurance company); (iv) any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (v) equity and/or debt interests that in the aggregate exceed 33 percent of a licensee’s total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15 percent of the station’s total weekly programming or is a same-market television broadcast company; and (vi) time brokerage of a television broadcast station by a same-market television broadcast company providing more than 15 percent of the station’s weekly programming.
 
Management services agreements and other types of shared services arrangements between same-market stations that do not include attributable time brokerage components generally are not deemed attributable under the FCC’s current rules and policies. However, the FCC previously requested comment on whether local news service agreements and/or shared services agreements should be considered attributable for purposes of applying the media ownership rules. The Department of Justice has taken steps under the antitrust laws to block certain transactions involving joint sales or other services agreements.
 
 14



To our knowledge, no officer, director or five percent or greater shareholder currently holds an attributable interest in another television station that is inconsistent with the FCC’s ownership rules and policies or with our ownership of our stations.
 
Alien Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act restricts the ability of foreign entities or individuals to own or hold interests in broadcast licenses. The Communications Act bars the following from holding broadcast licenses: foreign governments, representatives of foreign governments, non-citizens, representatives of non-citizens, and corporations or partnerships organized under the laws of a foreign nation. Foreign individuals or entities, collectively, may directly or indirectly own or vote no more than 20 percent of the capital stock of a licensee or 25 percent of the capital stock of a corporation that directly or indirectly controls a licensee. The 20 percent limit on foreign ownership of a licensee may not be waived. In September 2016, the Commission adopted an Order that allows broadcast licensees to use streamlined procedures when filing a petition for declaratory ruling seeking FCC approval to exceed the 25 percent foreign ownership benchmark for a parent company. The Commission also clarified the methodology for publicly traded broadcasters to assess compliance with the foreign ownership limits.
 
We serve as a holding company for our subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that hold station licenses. Therefore, absent a grant of a declaratory ruling, we may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-citizens, foreign governments, representatives of non-citizens or foreign governments, or foreign corporations.
 
Programming and Operations. Rules and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies regulate certain programming practices and other areas affecting the business or operations of broadcast stations.
 
The Children’s Television Act of 1990 limits commercial matter in children’s television programs and requires stations to present educational and informational children’s programming. Broadcasters are effectively required through license renewal processing guidelines to provide at least three hours of children’s educational programming per week on their primary channels and on each secondary channel. In July 2018, the FCC issued an NPRM that proposed sweeping changes to the current children’s programming rules that would give broadcasters increased flexibility in how they choose to serve the educational and informational needs of children. The NPRM remains pending, and we cannot predict what recommendations or further action, if any, will result from it.
 
Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $325,000 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding, and the courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
EEO Rules. The FCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) rules impose job information dissemination, recruitment, documentation and reporting requirements on broadcast station licensees. Broadcasters are subject to random audits to ensure compliance with the EEO rules and may be sanctioned for noncompliance.
 
MVPD Retransmission of Local Television Signals. Under the Communications Act and FCC regulations, each television station generally has a so-called “must-carry” right to carriage of its primary channels on all MVPD systems serving their market. Each commercial television station may elect between invoking its “must carry” right or invoking a right to prevent an MVPD system from retransmitting the station’s signal without its consent (“retransmission consent”). Stations must make this election by October 1 every three years, and stations most recently made such elections by October 1, 2017. Such elections are binding throughout the three-year cycle that commences on the subsequent January 1. The current carriage cycle commenced on January 1, 2018, and ends on December 31, 2020. Our stations have elected retransmission consent and have entered into retransmission consent contracts with virtually all MVPD systems serving their markets.
 
 15



On March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. As part of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 (“STELAR”), Congress further tightened the restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how this restriction might impact future opportunities.
 
The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming.
 
In June 2014, the Supreme Court issued a ruling finding that the streaming of broadcast programming over the internet without the consent of the copyright owner of the programming was a public performance that infringed upon the copyright owners’ rights. Broadcasters and other copyright owners had aggressively pursued injunctions against the companies offering these services in multiple jurisdictions. On December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on its proposal to modernize the term “MVPD” to be technology neutral. If the NPRM proposal is adopted, an entity that uses the internet to distribute multiple streams of linear programming would be considered an MVPD and would have the same retransmission consent rights and obligations as other MVPDs, including the right to negotiate with television stations to carry their broadcast signals. The FCC also asked about the possible copyright implications of this proposal. We cannot predict the outcome of the FCC’s interpretive proceedings.
 
STELAR was signed into law on December 4, 2014. STELAR extends the right of satellite TV operators to retransmit the signal of television broadcast stations for an additional five years and grants an extension of their compulsory copyright license for the carriage of distant TV signals. In accordance with STELAR, the FCC has promulgated rules that (i) grant DBS providers the right to seek market modifications based on factors similar to those used in the cable industry and cable operators the right to delete or reposition channels during “sweeps,” (ii) broadened the FCC’s prohibition against joint retransmission negotiations by directing the FCC to prohibit joint retransmission negotiations by any stations in the same DMA not under common control, (iii) prohibit a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed, and (iv) eliminated the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods.
 
In September 2015, the FCC, in accordance with STELAR, issued an NPRM to review the “totality of the circumstances test” used to evaluate whether broadcast stations and MVPDs are negotiating for retransmission consent in good faith. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC revises the totality of the circumstances test, it could affect our ability to negotiate retransmission consent agreements, including the rates that we obtain from MVPDs.

Broadcast Spectrum. In February 2012, Congress passed legislation that granted the FCC authority to conduct an auction of certain spectrum currently used by television broadcasters. On May 15, 2014, the FCC adopted a Report and Order (the “2014 Report”) establishing the framework for an incentive auction of broadcast television spectrum. The 2014 Report created a two part incentive auction framework (the “Incentive Auction”): (1) a reverse auction pursuant to which a television broadcaster could volunteer, in return for payment, to relinquish all or a part of its station’s spectrum by (i) surrendering its license, (ii) relinquishing a portion of its spectrum and thereafter sharing spectrum with another station, or (iii) modifying a UHF channel license to a VHF channel license; and (2) a forward auction pursuant to which wireless carriers bid for the relinquished spectrum to offer wireless services. In April 2017, the Commission issued a Public Notice announcing the conclusion of the Incentive Auction, which resulted in 84 MHz of broadcast spectrum being repurposed for wireless use.
 
Now that the Incentive Auction has concluded, the FCC has begun the process of reallocating the 84 MHz of spectrum to new users. Specifically, the FCC is requiring certain television stations that did not sell their spectrum in the reverse auction to change channels and modify their transmission facilities. The FCC is required to use “reasonable efforts” to preserve a station’s coverage area and population served, and cannot require that a station involuntarily move from the UHF band to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band. These changes may constrain our ability to provide high definition programming and additional program streams, including mobile video services. The underlying legislation authorizes the FCC to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs. Some television stations are required to change channels and modify their facilities or may choose to channel share. In March 2018, Congress adopted the Reimbursement Expansion Act (REA) to expand the list of entities eligible to be reimbursed for auction-related expenses to include LPTV and TV translator stations. The REA also increased the funds available to reimbursement full power and Class A stations.
 
The FCC interpreted the implementing legislation to allow only full power and Class A television stations to participate in the auction and receive contour protection during any post-auction repacking of the broadcast spectrum. In certain markets, our low power television stations may be displaced by this process. Moreover, on June 16, 2015, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to reserve one vacant channel in each market for use by unlicensed “white spaces” devices and wireless microphones (the “Vacant Channel NPRM”). The FCC further modified the Vacant Channel NPRM on August 11, 2015 by proposing to reserve up to two channels in certain markets after the Incentive Auction is complete. Under the Vacant Channel NPRM, the FCC would refuse to grant an application to modify the facilities of a low power television station if the applicant could not demonstrate that a sufficient number of vacant channels would remain in the service area of the low power station after the applicant implements the modification – thus, reducing the likelihood that a low power television station would be able to locate a new channel. These stations could incur substantial costs to locate and build a replacement facility on a new channel. If a low power television station is unable to locate a new channel on which to operate, it could lose its license.
 
We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or outcome of any court, Congressional or FCC regulatory action with respect to the repacking of broadcast television spectrum, nor the impact of any such changes upon our business.
 
The foregoing does not purport to be a complete summary of the Communications Act, other applicable statutes, or the FCC’s rules, regulations or policies. Proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before, are being considered by, and may in the future be considered by, Congress and federal regulatory agencies from time to time. We cannot predict the effect of any existing or proposed federal legislation, regulations or policies on our business. Also, several of the foregoing matters are now, or may become, the subject of litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or the effect on our business.
