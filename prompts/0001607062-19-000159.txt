Annual Wellness Visit (AWV)

Our proprietary algorithm determines a patients’ qualification for preventive screenings, health and lifestyle risks and if they have 2 or more qualifying chronic conditions that make them eligible for CCM. The program creates a 5-10 year preventive plan for the patient and meets all of CMS audit requirements to bill for the services. The AWV provides a proactive approach to patient care and increases practice revenue by identifying and executing CMS recommended screenings for the patient to catch early disease states before they become chronic conditions

 Our BioDatix differentiator from other wearables on the market is the passive collection of vitals and syncing to our RPM solution, where baseline alerts can be enabled to notify the user, designated care coordinator and the physician. The HealthDatix RPM solution creates trend reports for the physician to view and analyze. The capturing of meaningful data over the course of time paints a better picture of the overall health of the patient. Our system is not to diagnose, it is to provide the care provider with the necessary information to determine if it is medically necessary to intervene based on the data collected resulting in closer physician and patient engagement.
 
Future Products and Services
 
HeathDatix’s product strategy is to provide additional products that will support the patients that have been identified through the program to require additional chronic care management with a medical wearable that will allow ease of use for the patient and effective tracking and management by the physician through our developed chronic care management solution.
 
Our next generation BioDatix device will collect ECG and temperature and will have the ability to set collection times on a per patient basis.
