Item 1.  Business
 
Twin Disc, Incorporated (“Twin Disc”, or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1918. Twin Disc designs, manufactures and sells marine and heavy duty off-highway power transmission equipment. Products offered include: marine transmissions, azimuth drives, surface drives, propellers and boat management systems as well as power-shift transmissions, hydraulic torque converters, power take-offs, industrial clutches and controls systems. The Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets. The Company's worldwide sales to both domestic and foreign customers are transacted through a direct sales force and a distributor network. The products described above have accounted for more than 90% of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years.
 
On July 2, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Veth Propulsion. Veth Propulsion is a global manufacturer of highly-engineered primary and auxiliary propulsions and propulsion machinery for maritime vessels, including rudder propellers, bow thrusters, generator sets and engine service and repair, based in the Netherlands. These products are complementary to and expand the Company’s current product offerings in the marine and propulsion markets.
 
Most of the Company's products are machined from cast iron, forgings, cast aluminum and bar steel which generally are available from multiple sources and which are believed to be in adequate supply.
 
The Company has applied for patents in both the United States and certain foreign countries on inventions made in the course of its development work for which commercial applications are considered probable. The Company regards its patents collectively as important but does not consider its business dependent upon any one of such patents.
 
The business is not considered to be seasonal except to the extent that employee vacations and plant shutdowns, particularly in Europe, occur mainly in the months of July and August, curtailing production during that period.
 
The Company's products receive direct widespread competition, including from divisions of other larger independent manufacturers. The Company also competes for business with parts manufacturing divisions of some of its major customers. The primary competitive factors for the Company’s products are design, technology, performance, price, service and availability. The Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 49% and 57% of the Company's consolidated net sales during the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. There were no customers that accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019.
 
Unfilled open orders for the next six months of $99.6 million at June 30, 2019 compares to $115.0 million at June 30, 2018. Since orders are subject to cancellation and rescheduling by the customer, the six-month order backlog is considered more representative of operating conditions than total backlog. However, as procurement and manufacturing "lead times" change, the backlog will increase or decrease, and thus it does not necessarily provide a valid indicator of the shipping rate. Cancellations are generally the result of rescheduling activity and do not represent a material change in backlog.
 
Management recognizes that there are attendant risks that foreign governments may place restrictions on dividend payments and other movements of money, but these risks are considered minimal due to the political relations the United States maintains with the countries in which the Company operates or the relatively low investment within individual countries. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government.
 
Engineering and development costs include research and development expenses for new product development and major improvements to existing products, and other costs for ongoing efforts to refine existing products. Research and development costs charged to operations totaled $2.4 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Total engineering and development costs were $12.6 million and $9.9 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
