Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage, cancer-selective gene therapy company focused on developing first-in-class, broadly-applicable product candidates designed to activate a patient’s immune system against their own cancer. Our cancer-selective gene therapy platform is built on Retroviral Replicating Vectors, or RRVs, which are designed to selectively deliver therapeutic genes into the DNA of cancer cells. Our gene therapy approach is designed to fight cancer through immunotherapeutic mechanisms of action without the autoimmune toxicities commonly experienced with other immunotherapies. Our founding vision is “No One Should Die Of Cancer” because we believe the immune system can be safely activated to fight the patient’s cancer.
 We are developing our lead product candidate, Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) & Toca FC (extended-release flucytosine), initially for the treatment of recurrent high grade glioma, or HGG, a brain cancer with limited treatment options, low survival rates and, therefore, a significant unmet medical need. We are conducting a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with recurrent HGG (Toca 5), which is designed to serve as a registrational trial. Enrollment was completed for this clinical trial in September 2018. In February 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Toca 511 & Toca FC Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with recurrent HGG and in June 2017 the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted Toca 511 Priority Medicines, or PRIME, Designation for the treatment of patients with HGG. Breakthrough Therapy Designation indicates that preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapy. PRIME Designation indicates that there is a potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. We also have Fast Track Designation (which may lead to priority review of new products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need) from the FDA for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of recurrent HGG. We also received Orphan-Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of malignant glioma in addition to glioblastoma mutiforme, or GBM. Orphan-Drug Designation is a designation for a product that is designed to treat a rare disease or condition and which, if the product receives the first FDA approval for that disease or condition, may result in a period of regulatory exclusivity, subject to some exceptions. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA has designated both flucytosine and vocimagene amiretrorepvec as orphan medicinal products indicated for the treatment of glioma. The EMA provides several benefits to drug developers for developing drugs for orphan diseases. 
 We have conducted three ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trials involving 127 recurrent HGG patients. In these trials, we investigated three modes of Toca 511 delivery: injection into the cavity wall after surgical resection of the recurred tumor (the “resection injection” trial, n=56), direct intratumoral injection without resection (n=54), and intravenous administration followed, approximately one to two weeks later, by resection with further local vector delivery at the time of resection (n=17). Administration of Toca 511 was followed with cycles of Toca FC. In these trials, we observed potential benefits, including durable objective responses, extended overall survival compared to historical controls and a favorable safety profile. We did not reach a dose-limiting toxicity in these trials. 
 As of the final analysis in December 2017, of the 56 patients enrolled in the ascending-dose resection injection Phase 1 trial, conducted in 7 medical centers, six of the 53 efficacy evaluable patients had durable complete response (durable response is defined as objective response lasting for at least 24 weeks) and remain in response. In a subset of 23 patients that mirrors the entry criteria, clinical setting and dosing for patients in our Phase 3 clinical trial, 5 (21.7%) of these patients had durable complete response. Based on these Phase 1 clinical trial results, we are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial which is designed to serve as a potential registrational trial in patients with first or second recurrence of HGG who are planning to undergo resection.
 Based on preclinical data, we believe Toca 511 & Toca FC may have therapeutic benefit in multiple other solid tumor cancers. We conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial involving intravenous treatment of advanced cancers. In this trial, Toca 511 was administered by intravenous injection followed by subsequent intratumoral injection. We reported a favorable safety and tolerability for the Toca 511 & Toca FC regimen, confirmed vector deposition following intravenous Toca 511 administration in both immunologically “hot” and “cold” areas of metastatic tumors and peripheral blood monitoring suggests immune modulation consistent with observations in our recurring HGG studies. We plan to continue to evaluate safety, vector deposition and immune modulation over time. Data from this trial is informing our future development plans for Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with solid tumors. 
 Based on our findings in preclinical studies and clinical trials to date, we believe Toca 511 & Toca FC is a promising candidate for use in newly diagnosed HGG patients in combination with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. We have partnered with NRG Oncology, a member of the National Cancer Institute’s, or NCI, National Clinical Trial Network to develop a clinical trial utilizing Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The proposed Phase 2/3study (NRG-BN006) is expected to begin by the end of 2019 and will be conducted by NRG Oncology under its NCI-funded grant, with us supplying investigational drug and supplemental financial support.

Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the United States and accounts for nearly one in four deaths. Early cancer treatments relied on relatively non-specific and highly toxic small molecule chemotherapies. Over the last 20 years, a new paradigm of cancer research and treatment has emerged that is focused on more targeted therapies. Most recently this has included the emergence of immunotherapies that can stimulate a patient’s immune system to slow the growth and the spread of, and ideally, eliminate, cancer cells. These therapies have shown the potential to provide dramatic efficacy and to extend survival for cancer patients even in cases in which conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have already been used. 
 Despite these advancements, many current immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and T cell receptor, or TCR, T cells, are limited by their autoimmune and other side effects. Combination treatments are common in cancer, but combinations of immune mediated treatments with systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy may be challenging as chemotherapy is often damaging to the immune system. Thus, immunotherapies effective enough to be able to displace systemic chemotherapy are needed. The utility of oncolytic viruses alone as immunotherapy has been challenged by lack of specificity to tumor cells, injury to healthy tissues, lack of targeting to specific brakes on the immune system, and short-term effect due to effective clearance of the virus. Consequently, there remains a significant need for immunotherapies that are effective as well as safe and tolerable.
 In contrast to current immunotherapies, we believe our non-lytic RRV platform and lead product candidate have the potential to selectively infect cancer cells to stimulate robust and durable anti-cancer immune responses with minimal toxicity. Our RRVs are designed to selectively integrate into the DNA of cancer cells which then serve as factories to produce more of these RRVs by budding. The progeny RRV infect neighboring cancer cells, providing long-term presence of the therapeutic gene or genes delivered. Our novel therapies are also designed to break immune tolerance selectively in the tumor microenvironment.
 Our RRV platform is versatile and we believe it has the potential to deliver a wide variety of genes selectively to cancer cells. Our first RRV-based immunotherapy product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, is designed to replicate and spread through tumors without cell lysis then, upon activation, directly kill tumor and immune suppressive myeloid cells activating the immune system selectively against cancer through a combination of mechanisms. In addition, we are developing other RRVs to selectively deliver genes to cancer cells against validated immunotherapy targets.
 Our Proprietary Technology Platform: Harnessing Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Together to Fight Cancer
 We believe our investigational gene therapy platform and therapeutic genes represent innovative and differentiated approaches in cancer-selective immunotherapy which have the potential to drive a safe, powerful and durable immune response against cancer, without triggering autoimmunity. We chose to utilize RRVs as the basis of our gene therapy platform for cancer-selective immunotherapy because they exhibit several characteristics that we believe allow us to optimize the safety, delivery and persistence of our therapeutic genes in cancer cells. These characteristics include that they:

• | replicate readily and persist in the immune-defective environment of cancer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are controlled in healthy tissue by normal immune mechanisms;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | only infect dividing cells such as cancer cells;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | bud from, rather than lyse, infected cancer cells, reducing anti-RRV immune activation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | infect most cancer types; and
--+------------------------------


• | can cross the blood tumor barrier.

Our Pipeline
 
Our Strategy
 Our focus is to develop and commercialize first-in-class cancer-selective immunotherapies using our proprietary gene therapy platform. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Advancing Toca 511 & Toca FC rapidly through clinical development and regulatory approval in recurrent HGG. We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with recurrent HGG. If we achieve our primary endpoint, overall survival, and/or secondary endpoints, such as durable response rate, we plan to discuss submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, based on this data with the FDA. We believe such data could serve as the basis for regulatory approval. In February 2017, the FDA granted Toca 511 & Toca FC Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of patients with recurrent HGG and in June 2017 the EMA granted Toca 511 PRIME Designation for the treatment of patients with HGG. In October 2017, following discussions with the FDA, we redesigned our Phase 2/3 clinical trial to be a single Phase 3 clinical trial, thereby including the 187 patients that were previously enrolled in the Phase 2/3 clinical trial in the total of 380 patients expected to enroll in the redesigned trial. The primary endpoint of the redesigned trial is OS. The primary endpoint assumes a median OS of 9.8 months for the control arm versus 14.3 months for the Toca 511 & Toca FC arm. A total of 257 events will provide the redesigned trial with 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.685. The redesigned trial includes planned interim analyses at 50% and 75% of total events. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee completed its review at 50% of total events and recommended the Phase 3 clinical trial should continue as planned without modification. We plan to conduct the second interim analysis in the second quarter of 2019 after 75% of total events have occurred and the final analysis in the fourth quarter of 2019 after 100% of total events have occurred.

• | Expanding the therapeutic use of Toca 511 & Toca FC into newly diagnosed HGG and other solid cancer indications. We have partnered with NRG Oncology to develop a clinical trial utilizing Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The proposed Phase 2/3 study (NRG-BN006) is expected to begin by the end of 2019 and will be conducted by NRG Oncology under its NCI-funded grant, with us supplying investigational drug and supplemental financial support. We believe Toca 511 & Toca FC has potential broad applicability in the treatment of solid cancers. In July 2016, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial involving intravenous treatment of advanced cancers. In this trial we reported a favorable safety and tolerability for the Toca 511 & Toca FC regimen, confirmed vector deposition following intravenous Toca 511 administration in both immunologically “hot” and “cold” areas of metastatic tumors and peripheral blood monitoring suggests immune modulation consistent with observations in our recurring HGG studies. These data are helping to inform our future development plans for Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with advanced cancers.

• | Commercializing Toca 511 & Toca FC in the United States. If approved, we plan to build the capabilities to commercialize Toca 511 & Toca FC through medical science liaisons and a specialty sales force in the United States. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing strategic partnerships to expand the commercial opportunity for, and accelerate the development of, our product candidates. In April 2018 we entered into a license agreement with Beijing Apollo Venus Biomedical Technology Limited, and ApolloBio Corp., collectively ApolloBio, pursuant to which we granted to ApolloBio an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Toca 511 & Toca FC within the greater China region, including mainland

China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. We may choose to further partner our lead product candidate or our future product candidates in key markets or therapeutic areas where a partner could bring additional resources and expertise.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging our RRV platform and core competencies to continue discovering and developing a broad pipeline of novel cancer-selective immunotherapies. We believe there is a significant opportunity to develop additional immunotherapy product candidates utilizing our RRV platform. Our scientists have broad expertise in the field of gene therapy, spanning discovery, development and manufacturing. We intend to leverage our platform and expertise to discover and develop a broad pipeline of cancer-selective immunotherapies to help patients fight their cancers without the severe side effect profile typical of cancer treatments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Approach to Immunotherapy
 Due to the novel mechanisms of action and favorable safety profile in clinical studies to date, we believe our RRVs represent an important advancement in the field of immunotherapy. Our approach is designed to enhance immune responses against cancer cells and, in the case of our lead product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, reduce immune-suppressive myeloid cell inhibition of the immune system. Also, we believe our RRV platform has the potential to be safely combined with conventional therapies and complement emerging checkpoint inhibitors and other approaches to cancer immunotherapy.
Resection Injection Trial
 As of the final analysis in December 2017, of the 56 patients enrolled in the ascending-dose resection injection Phase 1 trial, conducted in 7 medical centers, six of the 53 efficacy evaluable patients had durable complete response (durable response is defined as objective response lasting for at least 24 weeks) and remained in response. Responses were assessed by independent radiology review of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, brain scans. In a subset of 23 patients that mirrors the entry criteria, clinical setting and dosing for patients in our Phase 3 clinical trial, 5 (21.7%) of these patients had a durable complete response. In addition:

• | Median duration of response had not been reached after a median follow up of 37.4 months (range: 14.1 to 44.9 months).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stable disease (lasting at least eight weeks) was observed in five additional patients, bringing the clinical benefit rate to 43.5% (10/23 patients).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Landmark overall survival, or OS, rates at two and three years (OS24, OS36) was 34.8% and 26.1%, respectively.

 In the table below, as of the final analysis in December 2017, clinical data for each of the 23 patients is represented by a blue bar, with the x-axis measuring months of survival. Change in patient tumor status (i.e., PD, SD, PR, or CR) are represented along the bar, with the status at the end representing “best response” during the treatment. The green stars indicate the six patients who remain alive at the latest data cutoff. The responses, which occur approximately six to 19 months after Toca 511 administration, are consistent with immunologic response and all responders who remain alive have received no therapy other than Toca 511 & Toca FC since enrolling in the trial. Median duration of response had not been reached after a median follow up of 37.4 months (range 14.1 to 44.9 months).

Resection Study: Long-Term Survival in Higher Dose Cohort
 
 
Historical estimate for mOS for lomustine is based on weighted average (Batchelor 2013, Taal 2014, Wick 2010, EORTC 26101: n=352).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Furthermore, an independent radiology review of MRI brain scans from our Phase 1 clinical trials identified tumor shrinkage in some patients, including several CRs. All patients in the resection injection trial with objective responses remain with durable response as of December 2017, for a median of 37.4 months, which represents approximately four times longer duration of response relative to responses from a clinical trial of lomustine which showed an estimated median duration of response of approximately six months (range of response duration was 2.79 to 9.62 months).

2 | Higher doses (cohorts 4-7a) and 1st and 2nd recurrence, no prior Avastin in rHGG, tumor not > 5cm.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on these data as well as a favorable safety profile we initiated a registration-directed Toca 5 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC in this same setting, enrolling patients with recurrent HGG who were planning for further resection of their tumor. Also, we chose the resection setting for the Toca 5 clinical trial because we believe that resection of the bulk of the tumor and then injection into the residual tumor left behind in the cavity wall provides a longer opportunity for the treatment to activate the immune system against the growing tumor.
 We also tested for changes in CD4 and CD8 T cells in blood during the study, allowing us to evaluate both the safety and activity of our treatment on the immune system. Changes were observed in these preliminary tests that are consistent with an increased T cell activation during therapy in patients with stable disease or complete responses.

Biomarkers
 As part of our exploration of mutation profiles that may serve as a biomarker for patients with a higher likelihood of long-term benefit, we observed that objective responses occurred in patients with IDH1 mutant (mt) and IDH1 wild type (wt) tumors. Approximately 15% of the population with HGG is believed to have the IDH1 mutation. Across the Phase 1 clinical trial program, and as of December 2017, the three patients with known IDH1 mutations at first recurrence had CRs (two in the resection injection study and one patient in the intravenous study with a radiologic CR) and all these IDH1 mutation patients are alive (range of survival 12.2 to 35.3 months), suggesting a potential association of IDH1 mutation to survival.
Pooled Safety Data
 Toca 511 & Toca FC has been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. There has been little difference in adverse events among the three Phase 1 clinical trials in recurrent HGG. For this reason we chose to pool safety data across the three ascending Phase 1 clinical trials. As shown in the table below, in 127 patients who received Toca 511, treatment-related adverse events were reported in 57.5% of the patients; Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 8.7% of patients. Grade 3/4 treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 6.3% of patients treated with Toca 511; Grade 3/4 treatment-related serious adverse event of vasogenic cerebral edema was reported in 1.6% of patient; both events were Grade 3.  We monitored blood samples for viral RNA and DNA and found that quantitative levels were cleared within two weeks to four months of administration. Also, we analyzed tumor and blood samples for viral insertion sites and demonstrated an absence of clonality, supporting viral safety. We also monitor Toca FC blood levels for the first treatment cycle and whenever the dose is increased. This helps us to adjust dosing upwards in patients with Toca FC blood levels below the target range. The favorable toxicity profile of Toca 511 & Toca FC suggests that combination with other modalities such as chemotherapy or radiation should yield little incremental toxicity.Adverse Events Related to Toca 511 & Toca FC – Pooled Across Studies

Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 In November 2015, we initiated the Phase 2 portion of a randomized, controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial of Toca 511 & Toca FC against the current standard of care in recurrent HGG. In this clinical trial we are using doses of Toca 511 & Toca FC of 4 mL and 220 mg/kg/day, respectively, equivalent to the doses used in the Higher Dose Cohort of our Phase 1 resection injection trial. Enrollment criteria for patients in this clinical trial includes first or second recurrence of HGG, no prior treatment with bevacizumab for recurrent HGG, and a tumor size of less than or equal to five centimeters. 
 In October 2017, based on our communications with the FDA under Breakthrough Therapy Designation, we modified the original two-step trial design (Phase 2 followed by Phase 3) into a seamless, Phase 3 pivotal trial, also known as the Toca 5 trial. Enrollment of the planned 380 patients in the Toca 5 trial was completed in September 2018. The redesigned trial includes planned interim analyses at 50% and 75% of total events. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee completed its review at 50% of total events and recommended the Phase 3 clinical trial should continue as planned without modification. We plan to conduct the second interim analysis in the second quarter of 2019 after 75% of total events have occurred and the final analysis in the fourth quarter of 2019 after 100% of total events have occurred.

Phase 1b Solid Tumor Clinical Trial
 We conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial involving intravenous treatment of advanced cancers. In this trial, Toca 511 was administered by intravenous injection followed by intratumoral injection. We reported a favorable safety and tolerability for the Toca 511 & Toca FC regimen, confirmed vector deposition following intravenous Toca 511 administration in both immunologically “hot” and “cold” areas of metastatic tumors and peripheral blood monitoring suggests immune modulation consistent with observations in our recurring HGG studies. We plan to continue to evaluate safety, vector deposition and immune modulation over time. Data from this trial are informing our future development plans for Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with solid tumors. 
Planned Clinical Trials
 In 2019, we plan to advance our clinical development evaluating Toca 511 & Toca FC in patients with newly diagnosed HGG. The proposed Phase 2/3 trial (NRG-BN006) is expected to begin by the end of 2019 and will be conducted by NRG Oncology. The primary goals of this study will be to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Toca 511 delivered at the time of resection and Toca FC subsequently delivered in conjunction with radiation and temozolomide.
Preclinical Studies of Toca 511 & 5-FC
 We believe our preclinical studies support the clinical development of Toca 511 & Toca FC in brain cancers and other cancers both as a stand-alone regimen and in combination with current treatments. During preclinical testing of Toca 511 we observed that treatment with Toca 511 & 5-FC had two powerful mechanisms of action: direct killing of cancer cells and activation of the immune system against the cancer cells. 5-FC, which we use in our preclinical studies, is the active component of the Toca FC tablets we use in humans. 
Discovery
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to develop additional immunotherapy product candidates utilizing our RRV platform. We intend to leverage our technology platform and expertise to discover a broad pipeline of cancer-selective immunotherapies.
Manufacturing
 Our lead product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, consists of a biological component and a drug component, which are separately manufactured and are both covered by our proprietary intellectual property. The process for Toca 511 manufacturing and testing has been developed internally and we believe that the process itself and the expertise to design and implement this process as well as the testing are significant assets. The process and the vector composition are covered by patents, patent applications and trade secrets. The process for Toca FC (extended release 5-FC) was also designed internally. We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for both of these manufacturing processes to produce our final product for clinical use, as currently we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. In addition we utilize contract testing organizations, or CTOs, for the establishment and performance of validated product release assays for Toca 511 & Toca FC material. For Toca FC and Toca 511, we require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and all other applicable laws and regulations. We plan to release material with appropriately qualified assays by our CTOs, who we require to operate under cGMP. We will retain final responsibility for product release and maintain an appropriate quality assurance capability to meet this need. We will continue to rely on CMOs and CTOs to manufacture and perform release testing, respectively, of our products for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with manufacturers and testing laboratories that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates and testing methods.
 We use a producer cell line to create Toca 511 and currently rely on a limited number of CMOs to manufacture Toca 511. We believe that our current manufacturing capacity for Toca 511 will be sufficient to support our ongoing and planned clinical trials and commercial manufacturing needs. 
 Manufacturing for Toca FC generally encompasses both the chemical synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and its formulation and fill/finish of the final product. We currently utilize a limited number of CMOs for the production of the API and the final drug product tablets. We believe we have the manufacturing capacity to supply the drug product tablets for our ongoing and planned clinical trials and commercial supply. 
 We currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing capacity to manufacture Toca 511 or Toca FC.

In addition, we may terminate the ApolloBio License Agreement upon written notice to ApolloBio under specified circumstances if ApolloBio challenges the licensed patent rights. 
 Laboratory Services and License Agreement with Siemens
 In November 2011, we entered into a laboratory services and license agreement with Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., or Siemens, which we amended in June 2015, pursuant to which we agreed to engage Siemens (i) to develop and perform certain in vitro diagnostic assays in connection with the cancer therapy trials of Toca 511 & Toca FC, (ii) concurrently and/or thereafter, to further develop, obtain FDA approval for, and perform one or more of such in vitro diagnostic assays as drug monitoring diagnostics for Toca 511 & Toca FC as Toca 511 & Toca FC receives marketing approval from the FDA, and (iii) following FDA approval of such in vitro diagnostic assay as a monitoring diagnostic, to perform such in vitro diagnostic monitoring assays as necessary in connection with post-marketing clinical trials of Toca 511 & Toca FC and, if appropriate, as commercial diagnostic tests. We granted Siemens the licensed intellectual property covered by the agreement on an exclusive and non-exclusive basis, depending on Siemens’ use of such intellectual property.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Siemens paid us an initial upfront payment of $0.5 million. Additionally, beginning with the first commercial sale of a product that has received approval for clinical use under the agreement, Siemens will pay us a royalty in the 10-20 percent range of net assay revenue with respect to approved designated assay products and net sales revenue with respect to approved in vitro diagnostic products, until the fifth anniversary of such commercial sale, subject to certain reductions. Beginning with the first commercial sale of Toca 511 or Toca FC, we will pay a royalty to Siemens in the low single-digit percentage range on net product sales of Toca 511 & Toca FC for sales up to the mid-nine-digit dollar range per year, until the fifth anniversary of such commercial sale.
 The term of this agreement will continue until the expiration of all payment obligations. The agreement provides that it may be terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement if such breach remains uncured for 45 days, or in the event the other party files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, is adjudicated as bankrupt or insolvent after all appeals are exhausted, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or fails to discharge or have dismissed within 60 days an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it. If market approval is rejected by the FDA, Siemens must provide us with prompt written notice. Should the parties be unable to reach mutual agreement regarding regulatory strategy within 20 business days of such notice, then either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice to the other party. Siemens may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days prior written notice to us, provided that, notwithstanding such termination, Siemens must continue to provide the laboratory services for any of our trials the protocol for which has been submitted to FDA until the conclusion of such pre-approval trial. Siemens may also terminate the agreement if, after using commercially reasonable efforts, certain assay specifications are not achieved. If Siemens terminates the agreement for breach of contract by us, the licenses granted to Siemens will survive such termination and will become non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable, provided that Siemens will have the right to terminate any such license at any time upon written notice to us. If the agreement expires, or if the 
 9

agreement is terminated by us for breach of contract by Siemens or for failure to reach an agreement on regulatory strategy, the restriction in the license granted to activities outside of the territory will terminate, and we will have the right to pursue development and commercialization of companion diagnostics for products with one or more other partners in the territory, and to grant to such other partners sublicenses of our rights under the agreement. If the agreement is terminated by either party for failure to reach an agreement on regulatory strategy, or by Siemens by 90 days written notice, for a minimum of 45 days after the later of (i) the termination date or (ii) completion of any required post-termination laboratory services and delivery to us of all results thereof, Siemens must retain any stocks of qualified reagents for the assays that remain as of Siemens’ completion of such laboratory services, and, upon our request made at any time during such 45-day period, Siemens must deliver such remaining stocks to us, provided that we shall have executed documentation reasonably satisfactory to Siemens acknowledging that the use of such reagents is restricted to investigational use pursuant to our investigational new drug application, or IND, and any other use permitted by, and in compliance with, applicable laws, regulatory guidelines and regulatory approvals.
 License Agreement with USC
 In October 2007, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Southern California, or USC, pursuant to which we received a worldwide, exclusive license to, among other things, manufacture and market products utilizing inventions related to our RRV platform and other key technology.
 Under the terms of the agreement, we paid an initial license fee to USC in the low six-digit dollar range and issued to USC shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the low single-digit percent range of all the number of shares of common stock issued at the time shares were issued to our six founders prior to the date of the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, we owe USC a royalty in the low single-digit percent range of our and our sub-licensee’s net sales of products covered by the agreement. In addition, we owe USC an additional royalty in the low single-digit percent range of revenue from our sub-licensees. Once our and our sub-licensees net sales reach an amount in the mid-seven digit dollar range, the minimum annual royalty payment due to USC will be in the low six-digit dollar range. Our royalty obligations continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patent covering a licensed product in such country.
 The term of this agreement will continue until all of our royalty payment obligations have expired unless terminated earlier. The agreement provides that it may be terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement if such breach remains uncured for 45 days. We may terminate the agreement without cause upon 45 days’ advance written notice to USC. USC may also terminate the agreement upon notice to us upon (i) the declaration by a court of competent jurisdiction that we are bankrupt and our assets are to be liquidated pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; (ii) upon the filing or institution by us of bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership proceedings under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; (iii) upon an assignment of a substantial portion of our assets for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) in the event a receiver or custodian is appointed in bankruptcy for all or substantially all of our business; provided, however, that in the case of any involuntary proceeding, such right to terminate shall only become effective if the proceeding is not dismissed within 120 days after the filing thereof. Upon termination of the agreement, all rights granted to or provided by each party to the other shall automatically and irrevocably revert to the granting party.
 Grants
 In August 2017, we were awarded a $2.0 million grant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Office of Orphan Products Development to support our Phase 3 clinical trial, or OOPD Grant. Under the grant agreement, we will be reimbursed for qualifying expenses over a four-year period subject to the availability of funds and satisfactory progress of the trial. At December 31, 2018, we had received $1.0 million relating to the OOPD Grant.
We have also received grants from the following entities: National Institutes of Health, Voices Against Brain Cancer, Musella Foundation, Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, Inc., National Brain Tumor Society, American Brain Tumor Association, Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Research Foundation, and Internal Revenue Service — Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project Program.
 Sales and Marketing
 We plan to build at the appropriate time a commercial infrastructure targeting oncologists, neuro-oncologists and neurosurgeons and related clinicians and health care workers in leading and regional cancer centers in the United States.
 We anticipate that our commercial infrastructure will be built around a “high-touch” model to maximize patient access to our products. In addition to an internal team of dedicated medical sales, marketing, medical affairs, reimbursement, and commercial operations personnel we anticipate leveraging external capabilities such as contract pharmacy services. It is possible that a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy program, or REMS, will be required for our products.
 10

For our lead product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC for HGG, we have established a base of scientific familiarity with leading physicians in the United States, EU, Canada, South Korea, Israel and Japan. If we obtain regulatory approval, we expect that the base of familiarity we have built with leading international brain cancer centers during the conduct of our clinical trials, including the Toca 5 trial, will help drive market acceptance of our product. We believe that the majority of patients undergoing treatment for HGG in the United States are treated at approximately 60 brain cancer centers in the United States, many of which have participated in our clinical trials. Therefore, we believe a highly specialized, relatively small, medically-focused sales force, in addition to medical science liasons, will be sufficient to support the commercialization of our product.
 Outside the United States, we may build our own commercial infrastructure or consider opportunities to enter into out-licensing or co-promotion agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to develop and/or commercialize our product candidates outside the United States. In April 2018, we entered into the ApolloBio License Agreement with ApolloBio pursuant to which we granted ApolloBio an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Toca 511 & Toca FC within the greater China region, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
 We currently have limited sales and marketing or distribution capabilities or in-house personnel specializing in these functions.
 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties.
 We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through Orphan-Drug Designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 We have obtained Orphan-Drug Designation for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of malignant glioma in addition to GBM, which makes the product eligible for a period of orphan drug exclusivity, if approved in this indication, under certain conditions. We believe that approval under a biologics license application, or BLA, will be eligible for 12 years of market exclusivity in the United States, 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe and significant durations in other markets, which would be complementary to any relevant patent exclusivity.
 Through licensing and developing our own portfolio, and as of December 31, 2018, we have rights to 14 issued patents in the United States, eight of which are assigned to us and six of which are exclusively licensed to us, and 81 issued and granted patents in foreign countries, 62 of which are assigned to us and 19 of which are exclusively licensed to us, 12 patent applications in the United States, all of which are assigned to us and 64 patent applications in foreign countries, all of which are assigned to us. We believe that the issued patents will provide coverage on our technology platform and product candidates until approximately 2030. We file intellectual property we believe to be key to our business at a minimum in jurisdictions including the United States, Europe and Japan. Our original core technology was licensed from USC and The Regents of the University of California. Families within the portfolio are directed to our RRV technology platform, the modified CD gene that we use in Toca 511, various other therapeutic modalities and genes for use with RRV, manufacturing methods for RRV, the extended release Toca FC formulation, various combination therapies with Toca 511 & Toca FC and other agents, intravenous administration of RRV and diagnostic assays for detection of RRV.
 We possess significant knowledge relating to the construction, manufacture, development and protection of gene therapy products. We aim to protect certain intellectual property through a trade secret strategy.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immunotherapy subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. A wide variety of institutions, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies developing products in immunotherapy and in our lead indication.
 Companies developing other immunotherapy products generally fall within the following categories:
  
• | diversified pharmaceutical companies developing immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies aimed at stimulating immune responses;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | companies developing CAR and TCR T cells; and
--+----------------------------------------------


• | companies developing virus-based technology.
--+---------------------------------------------

 11

Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. The availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payers will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry. We believe the competitive factors that will determine the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety, pricing and reimbursement, and convenience of our product candidates.
 Government Regulation
 Our most advanced product candidate, Toca 511 & Toca FC, is subject to regulation as a combination product in the U.S., which means that it is comprised of both a drug product and a biologic product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different Centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our Toca 511 & Toca FC product candidate, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product, which means that the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, has primary jurisdiction over premarket development. We have had formal communication with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, acknowledging that CBER will be the lead review agency while CDER will be a consulting agency for the Toca FC product component. Accordingly, we are investigating Toca 511 & Toca FC pursuant to a single IND and we plan to seek approval of the combination product through a single BLA. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate marketing authorization for Toca FC, the small molecule drug component of the combination.
 Combination products comprised of biological products, such as gene therapy products, and small molecule drugs, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising, and other promotional practices involving combination products. In the United States, before clinical testing of such combination products, we must submit an IND to the FDA, which reviews the clinical protocol, and the IND must become effective before clinical studies may begin. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of combination products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Within the FDA, CBER regulates gene therapy products. The FDA has published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy products, including their preclinical assessment, clinical protocols, observing patients involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.
 Ethical, social, and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing, and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies, or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

U.S. Combination Products Development Process
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product, including our Toca 511 & Toca FC combination product candidate, may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the components of the combination product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of certain preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines, are mandatory, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations. Current NIH guidelines are in flux and NIH has released a proposal to streamline oversight for gene therapy research. However, the roles and responsibilities of institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs at the local level will continue as described in the NIH guidelines. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, patient selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor patient safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent, which must be signed by each clinical trial patient or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving biological product candidates also must be reviewed by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 13

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The investigational product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to be ethically administered to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients; gene therapy is usually administered to patients in Phase 1 trials. This is also true in situations where toxicity can only be judged in patients with disease. An evaluation for preliminary evidence of efficacy can be performed at this time. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases, and to generate hypotheses for the dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate further dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe patients for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events with agents such as those we are developing for a period of up to 15 years, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of clinical trial patients.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for expedited reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the sponsor, or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the investigational product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the components of a combination product as well as finalize processes for manufacturing the components in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the components of a combination product candidate do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of an investigational biologic product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory, and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an 
 14

indication for which orphan Designation has been granted. Currently we have Orphan-Drug Designation for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of malignant glioma in addition to GBM. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes annual program fees on prescription drugs or biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the application also includes a non-orphan indication.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to an initial filing review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in substantial compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites, to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GLP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money, and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently from how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to assess further a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of original standard BLAs within 10 months of the 60 day filing date and 90% of original priority BLAs within six months of the 60 day filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. A major amendment (a significant amount of new information, new analyses, new study or trial report) can extend the review period (PDUFA goal date) by three months. The FDA may either decide to extend the review period or defer the review to a subsequent review cycle. 
 15

Orphan-Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan-Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. We have been granted Orphan-Drug Designation by the FDA for Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of malignant glioma in addition to GBM, the indication that we are initially pursuing. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. There can be no assurance that we will receive Orphan-Drug Designation for additional indications or for any additional product candidates.
 If a product candidate that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. The Committee of Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA has designated both flucytosine and vocimagene amiretrorepvec as orphan medicinal products indicated for the treatment of glioma. Orphan designation provides for a full waiver of Scientific Advice/Protocol Assistance fees in conjunction with small-medium enterprise designation.  Also included is a waiver of the fee for a marketing authorization application, and a 10-year market exclusivity upon approval which protects from market competition for similar medicines with similar indications.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has four programs in place intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics intended to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions: Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation.
 The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing a new product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Fast Track Designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. We have received Fast Track Designation of Toca 511 & Toca FC for the treatment of patients with recurrent HGG, to improve their overall survival.
 A new product can receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys all of the features of Fast Track Designation in addition to more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient development program, organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for priority review. Specifically, FDA intends to expedite the development and review of a Breakthrough Therapy by, where appropriate, intensively involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review. Where appropriate, FDA also intends to assign a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program. The FDA notes that a compressed drug development program still must generate adequate data to demonstrate that the drug or biologic meets the statutory standard for approval. Omitting components of the development program that are necessary for such a determination can significantly delay, or even preclude, marketing approval.

The FDA has granted Toca 511 & Toca FC Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of recurrent HGG. Our Breakthrough Therapy Designation application was based on data from three Phase 1 ascending-dose clinical trials involving 127 patients with recurrent brain cancer. The clinical data included results published in Science Translational Medicine, including safety data, patient survival data and data regarding durable, complete or partial tumor shrinkage as determined by independent radiology review. In addition, preclinical information was provided to the FDA supporting a novel immunological mechanism of action involving the depletion of immune-suppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation indicates that preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapy. Breakthrough Therapy Designation intensifies FDA involvement to ensure an efficient drug development program and is an organizational commitment from the FDA to involve its senior managers. When Breakthrough Therapy Designation has been granted, the FDA is encouraged to meet regularly with the sponsor and subsequent meetings are considered Type B meetings and are established based on the needs of the program.
 The FDA may grant Accelerated Approval to a product candidate for a serious or life-threatening condition upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct adequate and well-controlled additional post-approval trials to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 The EMA has granted Toca 511 & Toca FC PRIME Designation for the treatment of patients with HGG. To be eligible for PRIME Designation, a medicine must show a potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data that indicate the treatment may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing therapies. Through PRIME, EMA provides enhanced interaction to optimize development plans and enable accelerated assessments of applications for marketing authorization. 
 Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, PRIME Designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development process.
 An application for a product candidate may be eligible to obtain Priority Review Designation if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.  Priority Review Designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the review process. The PDUFA goal for Priority Review is 6 months from filing (8 months from complete submission), instead of 10 months (12 months from complete submission) for a Standard Review.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Maintaining post-approval compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of combination products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production and distribution of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to combination products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of combination products.
 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval 
 17

process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register the establishments where the approved products are made with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 The BPCIA includes, among other provisions:
  
• | A 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of the reference product, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A four-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of the reference product, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An exclusivity period for certain biological products that have been approved through the 351(k) pathway as interchangeable biosimilars;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The BPCIA also establishes procedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical trial.

Additional U.S. Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, may affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 In the United States, our current and future operations are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, for instance, the Office of Inspector General, U.Sl Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. These federal and state laws, some of which may not be applicable to us or our product candidates unless and until we obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our product candidates, include, among others, the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, which our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with, false claims statutes, transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, laws and regulation regarding providing drug samples, sales and marketing activities and our relationships with customers and payors as follows.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, recommending, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, recommendation or order of any health care item, good, facility or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other individuals and entities on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing of the product for unapproved or off-label, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services, reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 19

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes requirements on certain types of entities, known as covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, such as mandatory contractual terms, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates, which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, annually report to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Further, some state, local and foreign laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and/or require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and transfers of value made to physicians and other health care providers or entities, or marketing expenditures; require the licensure of sales representatives; require drug manufacturers to report information related to drug pricing; data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018); and laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, significant sanctions, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved products to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 In many of the markets where we may do business in the future, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. In the United States, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain product approval. A number of gene therapy products have recently been approved by the FDA. Although CMS subsequently approved its first method of coverage and reimbursement for one such product, the methodology has been subject to challenge by members of Congress. Often private payors follow the coverage and reimbursement decisions of the Medicare program, and it is difficult to predict how CMS may decide to cover and reimburse our product candidates, once approved, and those determinations are subject to change.
 20

Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. Additionally, third-party reimbursement may not be available or may not be adequate to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 We intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the United States and in selected foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions for our product candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly those in the European Union, the pricing of biologics is subject to governmental control and other market regulations which could put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval of a product candidate.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The Affordable Care Act will impact existing government healthcare programs and may result in the development of new programs.
 Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

 
• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. Legislation enacted in 2017, informally the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most
 Medicare Part D drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under th
e Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well 
as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace 
the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the fiscal year 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further product price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain products under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate product prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic products for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, may affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization 
 22

through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Environmental Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, may affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to influence otherwise a person working in an official capacity.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be subjected to different types of restrictions in different countries.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the required approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application equivalent to an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may start.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension, or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution in those countries.
