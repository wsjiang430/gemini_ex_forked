 ITEM 1.      BUSINESS.
 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing therapeutic medicines for patients suffering from debilitating diseases with significant unmet medical need. We have a pipeline of product candidates, across various stages of development, focused on autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions. We have three clinical‑stage product candidates and two pre‑clinical‑stage product candidates. We follow a disciplined and methodical approach to selectively identify, discover and acquire product candidates with strong biologic rationales or validated mechanisms of action. We believe that our product candidates have the potential to address multiple indications.
 Our portfolio of product candidates offers multiple development opportunities. By modulating different parts of the innate and adaptive immune system, these product candidates together have the potential to provide a variety of mechanisms to address multiple devastating diseases.
 Rilonacept is a protein cytokine trap for inhibiting interleukin‑1α, or IL‑1α, and interleukin‑1β, or IL‑1β. Cytokines are small proteins that play a key role in cell signaling. Rilonacept is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of Cryopyrin‑Associated Periodic Syndromes, or CAPS, and has been commercially sold as ARCALYST by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, for this indication since 2008. We licensed rilonacept from Regeneron in 2017. We are initially developing rilonacept for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis, a painful autoinflammatory cardiovascular disease with an estimated U.S. prevalent population of approximately 40,000 patients seeking and receiving medical treatment. We are not aware of any therapy currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. We are enrolling a single, pivotal, global, Phase 3 clinical trial in recurrent pericarditis, named RHAPSODY. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of 2019 and report top‑line data in the second half of 2020. RHAPSODY is a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized‑withdrawal, or RW, design study with open‑label extension which is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. We also have an ongoing open‑label Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept clinical trial in recurrent pericarditis, for which we have completed enrollment. In December 2018, we reported interim data from the Phase 2 trial. As of the November 1, 2018 data cutoff date, interim data from 12 symptomatic subjects participating in one portion of the Phase 2 trial showed a reduction in both c‑reactive protein, or CRP, an inflammation biomarker, and reported pain. As of the cutoff date, 10 of the subjects had completed the 6‑week base treatment period and entered into the optional 18‑week extension period. Four of the 10 subjects had completed the optional 18‑week extension period. All subjects showed a persistent clinical response as measured by c‑reactive protein and pain levels at each measurement point during the study. Rilonacept has been generally well‑tolerated in the trial, with adverse events, or AEs, consistent with the FDA‑approved label for the treatment of CAPS. The most common AEs were gastrointestinal disorders and injection site reactions. There was one treatment‑related serious AE which resulted in discontinuation: a skin abscess which responded to medical treatment. Infections are reported in the rilonacept label. We expect to present additional data from the Phase 2 trial at the American College of Cardiology 68th Annual Scientific Session & EXPO 2019, or ACC, in March 2019.
 Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that antagonizes the signaling of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, or GM‑CSF. We are focusing our initial development efforts for mavrilimumab on giant cell arteritis, or GCA, a chronic inflammatory disease of medium-large blood vessels with an estimated U.S. prevalence of approximately 75,000 – 150,000 patients. MedImmune Limited, or MedImmune, initially developed mavrilimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. MedImmune’s Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for the clinical development of mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA was initially put on clinical hold in 2010 before human data had been generated due to certain effects that were observed in non‑clinical studies, which coincides with a theoretical risk of developing pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, or PAP, possibly in the setting of GM‑CSF inhibition. Since then, in 2014, the FDA acknowledged that clinical studies in refractory RA may be appropriate based on MedImmune’s clinical studies in Europe in which it dosed over 550 RA patients with mavrilimumab with no evidence of PAP. Medimmune has since withdrawn the IND for Mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA, and we submitted a new

IND with the FDA for the study of mavrilimumab in GCA. The FDA initially placed our IND on clinical hold due to its request for additional information regarding the 510(k)‑cleared delivery device to be used in our Phase 2 clinical trial. We have since provided the FDA with the requested information and our IND is now active. We plan for U.S. subjects to be included in our ongoing, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, global Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept clinical trial, for which we have commenced dosing in multiple countries. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of 2019 and report top‑line data in the second half of 2020.
 KPL‑716 is a monoclonal antibody that simultaneously inhibits the signaling of the cytokines interleukin‑31, or IL‑31, and oncostatin M, or OSM, by targeting their common receptor subunit, oncostatin M receptor beta, or OSMRβ. We believe KPL-716 is the only monoclonal antibody in development that simultaneously targets both pathways. We plan to study KPL‑716 in a variety of pruritic, inflammatory, and fibrotic indications driven by these cytokines, including prurigo nodularis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition with an estimated U.S. prevalence of approximately 300,000 patients. At the European Association of Dermatology and Venereology congress in September 2018, we presented results from the randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, single‑ascending‑dose, sequential‑group portion of the Phase 1a/1b clinical trial in healthy volunteers and in subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus. In this trial, single intravenous, or IV, and subcutaneous, or SC, doses were well tolerated. The results provided an early signal in efficacy in reducing pruritus (assessed by the Worst‑Itch Numerical Rating Scale), as well as reducing inflammation and disease severity (assessed by Eczema Area Severity Index, or EASI) in atopic dermatitis subjects after a single dose of KPL‑716 in a placebo‑controlled, exploratory efficacy assessment (20 subjects were randomized 1:1 and received either 7.5 mg/kg IV of KPL‑716 or placebo). We believe these single‑dose results provide proof‑of‑principle for KPL‑716’s potential to treat a spectrum of IL‑31‑driven pruritic diseases, and support our plans to advance KPL‑716 into multiple chronic pruritic diseases. We plan to initiate an adaptive design Phase 2a/2b clinical trial in prurigo nodularis in the first half of 2019 and expect to report top‑line data from the first part of this trial in the first half of 2020. We also plan to initiate an exploratory, pilot Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2019 designed to explore the role of IL‑31 and OSM in a number of diseases characterized by chronic pruritus and to report top‑line data from this trial in the second half of 2020. To help us to understand whether KPL‑716 could be a competitive therapeutic in atopic dermatitis, if approved, and to provide long-term data on IL-31 driven pruritus as a proxy for other disease indications, we are enrolling a 12‑week, repeated single‑dose cohort as an additional part of the Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1a/1b clinical trial in subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus. This cohort is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, and it will allow us to conduct an exploratory efficacy analysis on both pruritus as well as disease severity response markers (assessed by EASI). We expect to report top‑line data from this cohort in the second half of 2019. 
 KPL‑404 is a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the CD40/CD40L interaction, a central control node of T‑cell‑dependent, B‑cell‑mediated humoral adaptive immunity. We are continuing our pre‑clinical activities in KPL‑404 in T‑cell dependent, B‑cell mediated diseases, and expect to file an IND with the FDA for this program in the second half of 2019 and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2020. In January 2019, we exercised our exclusive option to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Primatope Therapeutics, Inc., or Primatope, the company that owned or controlled the intellectual property related to KPL‑404, and closed this transaction in March 2019.
 KPL‑045 is a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the CD30/CD30L interaction, a T‑cell co‑stimulatory receptor involved in activated T‑memory cell function. We are currently evaluating the progression of KPL-045 pending preclinical data from the program in the context of our portfolio.

 The following table summarizes our current pipeline of product candidates:

 (1)Rilonacept (ARCALYST®) is approved and marketed for cryopyrin‑associated periodic syndrome, in the United States by Regeneron. We will assume the rights to this indication upon receiving approval for rilonacept in the recurrent pericarditis indication.
 (2)We are conducting pre-clinical activities for KPL‑404 and KPL‑045 and plan to review the potential for KPL‑404 and KPL‑045 in T‑cell‑dependent, B‑cell‑mediated diseases, such as pemphigus/pemphigoid, myasthenia gravis, or graft versus host disease.
 In addition to the indications described above, we plan to review the potential for rilonacept, mavrilimumab and KPL‑716 in other indications. We plan to be opportunistic in our business development activities to identify and potentially acquire the rights to additional programs or companies that could expand our portfolio or potentially add a platform capability. We have also initiated our own internal research efforts to discover and develop molecules to address areas of unmet medical need.
 We currently plan to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in the United States and select international markets. In parallel with our product development timelines, we plan to build our own commercial and operational organizations around the world as appropriate. We anticipate building targeted medical affairs and sales teams focused on specialist physicians who treat the patient populations addressed by our product candidates.

specialty‑focused patient populations. These companies include Synageva, Genzyme, Novo Nordisk, Shire, Sanofi, Pfizer, Bayer, Merck, Novartis and Vertex, among others.
 Our Strategy
 Our vision is to build a fully‑integrated, global biopharmaceutical company by discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing life‑changing therapies for debilitating diseases. We are developing a pipeline of novel drug product candidates for the treatment of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and we aim to be an industry leader in these areas. We are pursuing multiple programs in parallel, with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients as efficiently as possible.
 Critical components of our business strategy include the following:

· | Efficiently and Rapidly Advance Our Product Candidates Through the Development Process. We believe that our product candidates have the potential to address significant unmet medical needs and intend to develop them as efficiently and rapidly as possible. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Commercialize Our Product Candidates to Bring New or Improved Therapies to Patients in Need. We intend to market and commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in the United States and select international markets by developing our own sales, marketing, medical affairs and reimbursement organizations as appropriate. We anticipate creating a targeted sales organization that supports specialist physicians who treat these specific patient populations and plan to build out this organization as our product candidates approach potential regulatory approval. We believe this approach will allow us to effectively reach patients and prescribers that our product candidates target and leverage the commercial potential of our product candidates. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximize Our Existing Portfolio Opportunity by Expanding Use Across Multiple Indications. A core component of our approach to product development is identifying assets that have the potential to treat multiple diseases. We aim to develop and commercialize our product candidates to produce meaningful impact for patients across relevant indications. Our assets are designed to modulate signaling pathways that are implicated across a spectrum of autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions. We believe that our product candidates have potential in multiple indications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage Our Value‑Driven Approach to Identify, Discover, Acquire and Develop New Therapies. We follow a disciplined and methodical approach to our review of new opportunities. We focus on research‑based and comprehensive indication mapping exercises to categorize and prioritize indications of interest. We evaluate a variety of factors for potential product candidates, technologies and discovery targets, including biologic rationale for addressing the disease, potential for regulatory approval, commercial viability, intellectual property position, prospects for favorable pricing and reimbursement and the impact of competition. We also look at assets that could potentially address multiple indications. In building our current pipeline, we evaluated a large number of opportunities and negotiated agreements with parties for the assets that met our criteria and have in‑licensed or acquired the rights to develop and commercialize five separate biologics. Going forward, we intend to be opportunistic in our business development activities.

 Our Product Candidates
 Rilonacept
 Overview
 Rilonacept was approved by the FDA for the treatment of cryopyrin‑associated periodic syndromes, or CAPS, which includes cold auto‑inflammatory syndrome and Muckle‑Wells syndrome, and has been commercially sold as ARCALYST in the United States by Regeneron for this indication since 2008. We licensed rilonacept in 2017 from Regeneron. We believe that rilonacept has potential to treat certain diseases mediated by both IL‑1α and IL‑1β. Our lead indication for rilonacept is recurrent pericarditis, a painful autoinflammatory cardiovascular disease with an estimated U.S. prevalent population of approximately 40,000 patients seeking and receiving medical treatment. We are enrolling a single, pivotal, global, Phase 3 clinical trial in recurrent pericarditis, named RHAPSODY. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of 2019 and report top‑line data in the second half of 2020. We also have an ongoing open‑label Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept clinical trial in order to gain further experience with rilonacept in different recurrent pericarditis populations.  We completed enrollment for this trial and reported interim results of this trial in December 2018. We expect to present additional data from this trial at ACC in March 2019. We plan to review the potential for rilonacept in additional diseases mediated by IL‑1α and IL‑1β.
 There is currently one other FDA‑approved agent that blocks both IL‑1α and IL‑1β signaling, anakinra, and one that blocks only IL‑1β, canakinumab. We believe both therapies have limitations, and neither is approved by the FDA for treatment of pericarditis. Anakinra requires once‑daily injections, and canakinumab only blocks IL‑1β, making it less effective or ineffective in diseases driven by IL‑1α pathology. We believe that rilonacept with its more moderate, once‑weekly dosing schedule and its ability to inhibit both IL‑1α and IL‑1β could provide an improved therapeutic option for a variety of IL‑1α‑mediated diseases.
 Mechanism of Action
 Rilonacept is an inhibitor of IL‑1α and IL‑1β. IL‑1α and IL‑1β have been demonstrated to play a key role in inflammatory diseases. IL‑1α and IL‑1β provoke potent, pro‑inflammatory events by engaging the IL‑1α and IL‑1β receptor. Following tissue insult, the release of IL‑1α acts as the primary initiating signal to coordinate the mobilization of immune cells to the damaged area, while IL‑1β is secreted mostly by macrophages and is a prototypical cytokine of the canonical inflammasome. IL‑1α and IL‑1β signaling results in a dramatic increase in the production of cytokines that orchestrate the proliferation and recruitment of phagocytes to the site of damage, resulting in inflammation. Moreover, IL‑1α and IL‑1β signaling also affect other immune‑system cells, such as T‑cells and B‑cells.
 IL‑1β’s role in the inflammation process has been extensively studied, while in comparison, much is still unknown about the independent function of IL‑1α in disease pathology. Despite driving similar immunological outcomes, IL‑1α and IL‑1β differ substantially in their expression and regulation, and non‑redundant roles for IL‑1α or IL‑1β have been demonstrated in multiple inflammatory diseases. There are disease states in which IL‑1β inhibition alone does not appear to be sufficient for disease remission in the absence of IL‑1α inhibition. Published studies suggest certain autoinflammatory diseases may, in fact, be pathologically driven primarily by IL‑1α.
 An investigator‑initiated study of anakinra successfully demonstrated mechanistic proof‑of‑concept for inhibiting both IL‑1α and IL‑1β in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. In a published case study, a patient with a refractory form of recurrent pericarditis, who was well‑controlled on anakinra, was switched from anakinra to canakinumab, which inhibits only IL‑1β, for tolerability reasons. The patient’s disease returned despite further dose escalation of canakinumab. When the patient was switched back to anakinra, which inhibits IL‑α and IL‑β, the disease promptly went back into remission. These data, together with clinical data from our ongoing open‑label Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept study and confirmatory market research, may indicate that IL‑1α and IL‑1β play unique roles in recurrent pericarditis and other autoinflammatory diseases in which the pathology may be driven primarily by IL‑1α.

 Background and Market Opportunity for Recurrent Pericarditis
 Pericarditis is the most common disorder involving the pericardium, the two‑layered sac that surrounds the heart. Pericarditis is an inflammation of this sac and is typically characterized by significant chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing and fatigue and is often misconstrued by patients as a heart attack. In addition, typical signs of pericarditis include pericardial friction rub, electrocardiogram changes or pericardial effusion, which is a build‑up of fluid around the heart. Pericarditis is described as recurrent if, following an initial occurrence of pericarditis, it recurs after a symptom‑free period of about four to six weeks. Pericarditis is considered chronic if symptoms of any one episode last longer than three months, typically causing significant pain and frustration. If pericarditis is left untreated, patients can develop thickening and scarring of the pericardium, potentially requiring invasive surgical stripping. Pericardial effusion, if large enough, can compress the heart externally, requiring emergent drainage.
 We intend to focus our development of rilonacept for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis initially in the United States, and we are exploring opportunities for potential expansion into other countries. Claims analysis, cross validated with published estimates, supports a prevalent population of patients with recurrent pericarditis seeking and receiving medical treatment to be approximately 40,000. Within this estimated diagnosed and treated recurrent pericarditis patient population, there are certain subgroups of patients totaling approximately 14,000 with particularly high unmet medical needs consisting of:

· | patients who are refractory to conventional treatments (approximately 3,000);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | patients who are dependent on steroids or not well‑controlled on their existing therapy (approximately 6,000); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | patients who are steroid intolerant and refractory to NSAIDs and colchicine (approximately 5,000).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There may be other thoracic inflammatory syndromes where rilonacept may prove beneficial, such as pericarditis associated with post‑pericardiotomy syndrome, an inflammatory reaction of the pericardium in patients who have undergone surgery that involves opening the pericardium. Post‑pericardiotomy syndrome occurs in up to 30% of the 300,000 patients in the United States undergoing open heart surgery, and we believe rilonacept may be a therapeutic option for a subset of these patients.
 Current Treatment Landscape for Recurrent Pericarditis
 We are not aware of any current therapies approved by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. A patient’s initial acute episode of pericarditis is typically treated with over‑the‑counter or prescription NSAIDs or colchicine, both of which are used off‑label. Recurrent episodes are treated in a similar manner or by adding systemic corticosteroids which are also used off‑label. Both colchicine and corticosteroids often have deleterious effects when used at high doses or for long periods of time, including, for colchicine, gastrointestinal distress and neutropenia and, for corticosteroids, glaucoma, fluid retention, hypertension, mood changes, memory changes, other psychological effects, weight gain and diabetes. Fourth‑line treatment for these patients may include other immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and azathioprine, as well as anakinra. Our Solution
 Rilonacept is a weekly, subcutaneously‑injected, recombinant fusion protein that blocks IL‑1α and IL‑1β signaling. Beyond recurrent pericarditis, we believe there is significant potential for rilonacept to address additional indications, including other pericarditis populations. More broadly, we believe diseases characterized by painful serosal inflammation may be driven by IL‑1α, and we intend to consider development of rilonacept in these indications and in others where we believe IL‑1α or IL‑1β play a key role in disease pathophysiology.

 Clinical Development Plan for Recurrent Pericarditis
 We are enrolling a pivotal, global Phase 3 clinical trial, named RHAPSODY. The study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rilonacept treatment in subjects with recurrent pericarditis. RHAPSODY is a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized withdrawal, or RW study with an open‑label extension period. We expect that up to approximately 50 subjects will be randomized into the RW period. Eligible subjects must present at screening with at least a third pericarditis episode, defined as at least 1 day with pericarditis pain ≥ 4 on the 11‑point NRS and a C‑reactive protein, or CRP, value ≥1 mg/dL within the 7‑day period prior to first study drug administration. Subjects included in the study may be receiving concomitant nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine or oral corticosteroid treatment in any combination.
 The clinical study is comprised of 5 periods:

· | a screening period;
--+--------------------


· | a single‑blind run‑in period during which subjects receive a 320 mg loading dose of rilonacept subcutaneously followed by 160 mg SC weekly while background pericarditis medications are tapered and discontinued;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a double‑blind, placebo‑controlled 24‑week RW period where clinical responders to rilonacept are randomized 1:1 to 160 mg SC weekly rilonacept or placebo;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a long‑term extension treatment period for where all subjects completing the RW period have the option to receive up to 24‑weeks of open‑label rilonacept 160 mg SC weekly; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a long‑term extension follow‑up period during which all subjects in the long‑term extension period will be followed for 24 weeks for safety and pericarditis recurrences.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The primary efficacy endpoint is time‑to‑first‑pericarditis‑recurrence in the RW period. The Clinical Endpoint Committee will adjudicate all suspected pericarditis recurrences for inclusion in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of 2019 and report top‑line data in the second half of 2020.
 We have an ongoing open‑label Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept clinical trial for rilonacept in recurrent pericarditis in order to gain further experience with rilonacept in different pericarditis populations. This trial evaluates the treatment response to rilonacept in subjects with both symptomatic recurrent pericarditis as well as other patient subsets within pericarditis, including asymptomatic steroid‑dependent subjects with recurrent pericarditis and subjects with post‑pericardiotomy syndrome. The trial is divided into five parts, each enrolling subjects who are currently on any combination of co‑administered NSAIDs, colchicine or corticosteroids. The subjects are dosed using the approved rilonacept dose for CAPS, which is a loading dose of two 160 mg subcutaneous doses (320 mg total), followed by single, self‑administered 160 mg subcutaneous doses every seven days for a total of six weeks. This is followed by an 18‑week extension period. During the extension period, the investigator may choose to wean concomitant NSAIDs, colchicine or corticosteroids according to standard‑of‑care paradigms. The assessed efficacy outcomes measures include an 11‑point pain Numerical Rating Scale or, NRS, CRP, electrocardiogram, and size of pericardial effusion.
 The five parts of the trial with different patient populations are:

· | Part 1: Symptomatic subjects with recurrent pericarditis receiving NSAIDS +/− colchicine +/− steroids with high CRP, a marker of inflammation, measurements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Part 2: Symptomatic subjects with recurrent pericarditis receiving NSAIDS +/− colchicine +/− steroids without elevated CRP measurements but with evidence of pericardial inflammation by MRI;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  11

 


· | Part 3: Subjects with recurrent pericarditis who are dependent upon or unable to wean off of corticosteroids;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Part 4: Symptomatic subjects with postpericardiotomy syndrome receiving NSAIDS +/− colchicine +/− steroids with high CRP measurements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Part 5: Subjects with postpericardiotomy syndrome who are dependent upon or unable to wean off of corticosteroids.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In December 2018, we reported interim data from Part 1 of the open‑label Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept clinical trial that showed a reduction in both inflammation and reported pain in the 6‑week base treatment period and a persistent clinical response during the optional 18‑week extension period.
 As of the November 1, 2018 interim data analysis cutoff, 12 subjects, each with at least 3 episodes of pericarditis and elevated CRP (>1 mg/dL), enrolled in a 6‑week base treatment period. Results showed a reduction in both a biomarker of inflammation (CRP) and reported pain (NRS) after the first dose and a persistent clinical response throughout the 6‑week base treatment period:

· | mean patient‑reported pericardial pain on a 11‑point NRS decreased from 4.6 at baseline (n=12) to 0.9 at 6 weeks (n=8);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | mean CRP decreased from 4.9 mg/dL at baseline (n=12) to 0.37 mg/dL at 6 weeks (n=4); median time to CRP normalization was 9 days (n=12); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | pericardial signs resolved, including pericardial effusion (5/6 subjects), PR depression (3/4 subjects), widespread ST elevation (2/2 subjects), and pericardial rub (3/3 subjects).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of November 1, 2018, 10 of the 12 enrolled subjects received at least 6 weeks of treatment with rilonacept, 6 continued into the optional 18‑week extension period, and 4 completed 24 weeks of treatment. These subjects exhibited a continued clinical response to rilonacept, including as described below:

· | mean patient‑reported pericardial pain on a 11‑point NRS was 0.3, and mean CRP was 0.44 mg/dL at 24 weeks (n=4);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the pericardial effusion in the 1 remaining subject resolved during the extension period; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | of the 4 subjects on corticosteroids at baseline, the 1 subject who had completed 24 weeks of treatment successfully tapered off corticosteroids.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Rilonacept has been generally well‑tolerated in the study, with AEs consistent with the FDA‑approved label for the treatment of CAPS, including Familial Cold Auto‑inflammatory Syndrome and Muckle‑Wells Syndrome. The most common AEs were gastrointestinal disorders and injection site reactions. Seven of 12 subjects experienced at least one treatment‑related adverse event during the treatment period. There was one treatment‑related serious AE which resulted in discontinuation: a skin abscess which responded to medical treatment. Infections are reported in the rilonacept label for CAPs.
 We closed enrollment for the open‑label Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept study in December 2018 and we expect to present additional data from this trial at ACC in March of 2019.
 Clinical History of Rilonacept
 Regeneron evaluated rilonacept in a total of 21 clinical trials, including two trials in over 100 patients for the treatment of CAPS, and six trials in over 1,800 patients for the treatment of gout flares.

· | CAPS: Regeneron evaluated rilonacept for the treatment of CAPS in two trials. In these trials, 109 patients with CAPS, including eight pediatric patients, were treated with at least one dose of rilonacept. In the pivotal efficacy trial, which evaluated the long‑term efficacy and safety of once‑weekly dosing, 160 mg of rilonacept markedly decreased the clinical signs and symptoms of CAPS. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gout: Regeneron evaluated rilonacept for the treatment of gout flares in six trials. In the two pivotal efficacy trials in patients with gout, which evaluated the efficacy of once‑weekly dosing for the prevention of gout flares during initiation of uric acid‑lowering therapy, rilonacept at doses of 80 mg and 160 mg significantly decreased the number of gout flares. Regeneron abandoned active development for the treatment of gout flares after receiving a complete response letter from the FDA requesting additional clinical data, as well as additional CMC information related to a proposed new dosage form Regeneron was evaluating for gout, which was different than the dosage form approved in the CAPS indication and now being used for pericarditis. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other Indications: Regeneron conducted a total of 13 clinical trials of rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, polymyalgia rheumatica, osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and end‑stage renal disease.

  In the 21 clinical studies conducted by Regeneron with rilonacept to date, the most common adverse events reported were injection site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections. Across these studies, there were a total of five serious adverse events, or SAEs, that were assessed by investigators as drug related. Among patients treated with rilonacept there were three SAEs, colitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and drug eruption. One patient treated with placebo experienced cellulitis and another placebo‑treated patient died. The largest clinical programs conducted by Regeneron with rilonacept were its Phase 2 and Phase 3 programs for gout flare prevention, which treated a total of 1,886 patients. The most common adverse events reported for the 160 mg dose, the dosage used for the treatment of CAPS, were injection site reactions (15.5% for rilonacept versus 2.6% for placebo) and upper respiratory tract infections (10.3% for rilonacept versus 10.1% for placebo).
 Mavrilimumab
 Overview
 Mavrilimumab is a fully‑human monoclonal antibody that antagonizes GM‑CSF signaling by binding to the alpha subunit of the GM‑CSF receptor. Our lead indication for mavrilimumab is GCA, a chronic inflammatory disease of medium-large blood vessels with an estimated U.S. prevalence of approximately 75,000 – 150,000 patients. We have commenced dosing in multiple countries in a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, global Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept trial for the study of mavrilimumab in GCA. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of 2019 and report top‑line data in the second half of 2020.
 Before we licensed mavrilimumab in 2017, MedImmune, Limited, or MedImmune, was developing mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA.
 Mechanism of Action
 Mavrilimumab is designed to inhibit the signaling of GM‑CSF, a growth factor that stimulates the production of certain types of white blood cells. Studies have demonstrated that with GM‑CSF overexpression, pathological changes almost always follow. Reported data suggest GM‑CSF is a key player in autoinflammation and autoimmunity, as follows:
· | GM‑CSF enhanced trafficking of myeloid cells through activated endothelium of blood vessels and contributed to monocyte and macrophage accumulation in blood vessels during inflammation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  13

 


· | GM‑CSF promoted activation, differentiation, survival and proliferation of monocytes and macrophages, as well as resident tissue macrophages in inflamed tissues;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | GM‑CSF production led to activation of the vasculature and bone marrow and also promoted the differentiation of effector T cells at inflamed sites and draining lymph nodes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | GM‑CSF regulated the phenotype of antigen‑presenting cells in inflamed tissues by promoting the differentiation of infiltrating monocytes into M1 macrophages and monocyte‑derived dendritic cells, or MoDCs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Additionally, GM‑CSF has been shown to be a confirmed mediator in RA based on the results from the Phase 2b clinical trial in RA conducted by MedImmune. In this trial, mavrilimumab achieved the co‑primary endpoints of change from baseline in disease activity score, or DAS, at week 12 and a response of 20% or greater improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria, at week 24. Patients with mavrilimumab showed a statistically significant reduction in DAS scores at all dosages compared to placebo, and significantly more mavrilimumab‑treated patients achieved ACR20 at all dosages compared to placebo.
 Background and Market Opportunity for Giant Cell Arteritis
 GCA is an inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that strikes older adults and causes headaches, jaw and other muscle claudication, and possible ischemic visual loss. Many of the symptoms and signs of GCA result from involvement of the cranial branches of arteries that originate from the aortic arch, but the disease is systemic, and vascular involvement can be widespread. GCA is characterized by infiltration of monocytes, macrophages and the formation of giant cells (i.e., multinucleated fusions of macrophages). GCA generally occurs in adults over 50 years old with a 3:1 imbalance of women to men. We estimate there to be approximately 75,000 to 150,000 prevalent patients with GCA in the United States with similar prevalence rates for other major markets and believe that the incidence of GCA will increase over time as the population ages. Current Treatment Landscape for Giant Cell Arteritis
 Glucocorticoids, a type of corticosteroid, are the mainstay for the treatment of GCA because they normalize inflammatory markers and resolve patient symptoms. Many patients receive long courses of this therapy to prevent disease flare‑up, which are associated with significant and serious side effects, including glaucoma, fluid retention, hypertension, mood changes, memory changes, other psychological effects, weight gain and diabetes. Up to 80% of patients suffer from glucocorticoid toxicity as a result of GCA treatment.
 Despite being effective for some patients, many are unable to wean off of corticosteroids because they continue to experience disease flares as the dose is reduced. In one study cohort published in the literature that followed 106 patients with GCA for 4.5 to 10.1 years, 68 patients (64%) experienced at least one relapse during or after weaning, and 38 patients (36%) experienced two or more. Experimental evidence in mice suggests that corticosteroid treatment does not adequately suppress tissue‑infiltrating macrophage function, a key cell type generated and maintained by GM‑CSF signaling, and may explain why many patients require long‑term chronic treatment and are unable to wean off corticosteroids. We believe by blocking GM‑CSF signaling, mavrilimumab may provide additional benefit to these patients by reducing long‑term sequelae that results from chronic vessel inflammation.
 In addition, tocilizumab, an inhibitor of interleukin‑6, or IL‑6, is approved in the United States in GCA for use on top of a concomitant corticosteroid taper. However, nearly half of the patients studied in the Phase 3 clinical trial for tocilizumab experienced disease flares during the 52 weeks treatment period that included a 26‑week corticosteroid taper. We believe this indicates a persistent unmet medical need.
 Our Solution
 We chose GCA as our first indication for mavrilimumab due to the mechanistic rationale of inhibiting GM‑CSF. GM‑CSF is a key growth factor for many of these key inflammatory cell types and is found in high 

 
  14

 
concentrations at the site of damage in the vessel wall. We believe these data provide a solid rationale for antagonizing this signaling with mavrilimumab.
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial for GCA
 We have commenced dosing in a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, global Phase 2 proof‑of‑concept trial in multiple countries. In the United States, the FDA initially placed our IND on clinical hold due a request for additional information regarding the 510(k)‑cleared delivery device to be used in our Phase 2 clinical trial. The device‑related information request did not pertain to pre‑clinical toxicology data nor the design of our trial. We have since provided the FDA with the requested information and the IND is now active. We plan for U.S. subjects to be included in the ongoing, global Phase 2 clinical trial, in which dosing has already commenced in multiple countries. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial in the second half of 2019 and report top‑line data in the second half of 2020.
 The Phase 2 clinical trial of mavrilimumab for the treatment of GCA is expected to enroll approximately 60 subjects with new‑onset and refractory disease. Subjects will be randomized 3:2 to mavrilimumab 150 mg or placebo injected SC once every two weeks co‑administered with a corticosteroid taper. Treatment duration is 26 weeks, and the primary efficacy endpoint is time to first flare.
 We anticipate that to help inform the risk/benefit profile for the use of mavrilimumab in GCA, we will need to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of mavrilimumab after 26 weeks, as well as evaluate its pharmacokinetic profile and the effectiveness of mavrilimumab at different doses. We also intend to initiate research and development activities of mavrilimumab’s potential across other various disease states where cells of myeloid phenotype have been implicated by the literature, such as other vasculitides and cardiomyopathies, diseases characterized by barrier dysfunction, other arthropathies or oncologic indications.
 Clinical History in Rheumatoid Arthritis
 MedImmune had received authorization to conduct clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, in Europe and executed an extensive Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical program where the company studied mavrilimumab in over 550 patients with RA through Phase 2b. All of MedImmune’s European clinical trials achieved their prospectively defined primary endpoints of safety or efficacy.
 MedImmune’s IND for the clinical development of mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA was initially put on clinical hold in 2010 before human data had been generated due to certain effects that were observed in non‑clinical studies, which coincides with a theoretical risk of developing PAP, possibly in the setting of GM‑CSF inhibition. Since then, in 2014, the FDA acknowledged that clinical studies in refractory RA may be appropriate based on MedImmune’s clinical studies in Europe in which it dosed over 550 RA patients with mavrilimumab with no evidence of PAP attributable to mavrilimumab following long‑term administration. MedImmune did not engage in further dialogue with the FDA and withdrew the IND for mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA.
 We believe that the trials conducted by MedImmune provide substantial support for the potential of mavrilimumab in autoimmune diseases. In these trials, mavrilimumab was observed to be well‑tolerated. The most common adverse event was infection, with all dose groups (30 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg) in a Phase 2b clinical trial reporting similar rates of infection compared to the placebo group. We believe that these safety results provide an accurate early representation of the safety profile of mavrilimumab, which we believe to be at least competitive with and potentially better than existing systemically administered agents for autoimmune diseases.
 Mavrilimumab’s results from Phase 2b clinical trials in RA have provided important information about its safety and efficacy profile and helped solidify our choice for focusing our development efforts in GCA as a lead indication. In addition to the reductions to the primary endpoint demonstrated in the Phase 2b trials, other markers of inflammation, such as CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR, and IL‑6, were similarly reduced, as shown in the 

 
  15

 
graphs below. CRP, ESR and IL‑6 are key markers of disease activity for GCA. We believe that these results may also provide evidence for mavrilimumab’s utility across a broad range of indications with a similar biomarker profile.

 KPL‑716 
 Overview
 KPL‑716 is a fully‑human monoclonal antibody that targets OSMRβ, which mediates signaling of IL‑31 and OSM, two key cytokines implicated in inflammation, pruritus and fibrosis. We believe KPL‑716 to be the only monoclonal antibody in development that targets both pathways simultaneously. We are initially evaluating KPL‑716 for the treatment of a variety of pruritic diseases, including prurigo nodularis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition with an estimated U.S. prevalence of approximately 300,000 patients. In September 2018, we announced interim results from the randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, single‑ascending‑dose, sequential‑group portion of the Phase 1a/1b clinical trial of KPL‑716 in healthy volunteers and in subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus. In this trial, single IV and SC doses were well‑tolerated. Results also provided an early signal of efficacy in reducing pruritus (assessed by the Worst‑Itch Numeric Rating Scale), as well as reducing inflammation and disease severity (assessed by EASI), indicative of target engagement. In addition, we observed a reduction of EASI scores in atopic dermatitis subjects after a single dose of KPL‑716 in a placebo‑controlled exploratory efficacy assessment in subjects who participated in the first portion of the Phase 1a/1b clinical study (20 subjects were randomized 1:1 and received either 7.5 mg/kg of KPL‑716 or placebo). We believe these single‑dose results provide proof‑of‑principle for KPL‑716’s potential to treat a spectrum of IL‑31‑driven pruritic diseases, and support our plans to advance KPL‑716 into multiple chronic pruritic diseases. We plan to initiate an adaptive design Phase 2a/2b clinical trial in prurigo nodularis in the first half of 2019 and expect to report top‑line data from the first part of this trial in the first half of 2020. We also plan to initiate an exploratory, pilot Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2019 designed to explore the role of IL‑31 and OSM in a number of diseases characterized by chronic pruritus. To help us to understand whether KPL‑716 could be a competitive therapeutic in atopic dermatitis, if approved, and to provide long-term data on IL-31 driven pruritus as a proxy for other disease indications, we are enrolling a repeated‑single‑dose cohort as an additional part of the Phase 1b clinical trial in subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus. We expect to report top‑line data from this cohort in the second half of 2019.
 We acquired the assets relating to KPL‑716 from Biogen MA, Inc., or Biogen, in 2016.
 Mechanism of Action
 The OSMRβ subunit is an IL‑6 type receptor which combines with one of two other subunits to form two distinct cytokine receptors used for the signaling of two different cytokines: IL‑31, and OSM. IL‑31 produced in the 

 
  16

 
setting of an inflammatory response binds to the IL‑31 receptor on keratinocytes, epidermal cells, leading to a sensation of pruritus and further inflammatory responses in the skin. In addition to interacting with IL‑31 receptors on keratinocytes, IL‑31 also stimulates pruritus directly through IL‑31 receptors expressed on unmyelinated C‑fibers in the skin responsible for the sensation and transmission of pruritic signaling.
 OSM is produced primarily under inflammatory conditions and stimulates dermal fibroblast proliferation and migration as well as synthesis of collagen and glycosaminoglycan in the skin, leading to fibrosis. In addition to these functions, OSM signaling through the type II OSM receptor upregulates interleukin‑4, or IL‑4, interleukin‑13 receptor, or IL‑13Rα1, and interleukin‑4 receptor, or IL‑4Rα, in human skin equivalent cultures, upregulates IL‑4Rα in primary human keratinocytes and also impairs expression of filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin (classical “differentiation” markers of the epidermal differentiation complex cluster) in human skin equivalent cultures. These data implicate OSM signaling as important in many autoimmune diseases characterized by barrier dysfunction, fibrosis and inflammation.
 KPL‑716 inhibits both IL‑31 and OSM activities at their respective receptors, potentially disrupting the pruritus, inflammation and fibrosis mediated by these cytokine pathways.
 Background and Market Opportunity for Prurigo Nodularis, Other Chronic Pruritic Diseases and Atopic Dermatitis 
 Prurigo Nodularis
 Prurigo nodularis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects primarily older adults and is characterized by multiple firm and extremely pruritic nodules typically located on the arms and legs. The etiology of prurigo nodularis is largely unknown, however, human biopsy studies have shown that the cytokines IL‑31 and OSM and the receptor chains IL‑31Rα and OSMRβ are highly expressed in prurigo nodularis lesions. The pruritus is severe and distressing and can be sudden, sporadic or continuous, worsening with heat, sweating or irritation from clothing. The itching sensation in prurigo nodularis is extreme and often leads to scratching to the point of bleeding, infection or pain. Our market research to‑date with physicians and patients highlights the severe and debilitating nature of this disease and the significant levels of unmet need. Multiple physicians have reported suicidal tendencies among their prurigo nodularis patients due to an overwhelming inability to control the unrelenting itch. The exact prevalence of prurigo nodularis is unknown, however, we estimate there to be approximately 300,000 prevalent cases in the United States. Other Chronic Pruritic Diseases
 In the exploratory, pilot Phase 2 clinical trial that we plan to initiate in the first half of 2019, we currently expect to evaluate study populations with chronic idiopathic urticaria, chronic idiopathic pruritus, plaque psoriasis, lichen planus, and lichen simplex chronicus.
· | Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria. Chronic idiopathic urticaria is the chronic occurrence of hives without a known cause. We estimate that there are approximately two to three million patients in the United States with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Based on company survey data of over 100 treating physicians, or company survey data, approximately one out of three patients experience pruritus that is refractory to conventional therapies, and among patients treating their chronic idiopathic urticaria with Xolair (omalizumab), 15% to 20% continue to experience pruritus. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Chronic Idiopathic Pruritus. Chronic idiopathic pruritus is chronic itching without a known cause. Based on company survey data, treating physicians report that there is approximately one patient with idiopathic pruritus for every three atopic dermatitis patients, and approximately 50% of these patients experience symptoms lasting for more than one year and one in three treated patients experience refractory pruritus. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Plaque Psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis and causes skin lesions with silvery scales. We estimate that there are approximately 12 million patients with plaque psoriasis in the United States with approximately two to three million patients experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  17

 


· | Lichen Planus. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory and immune‑mediated disease that affects the skin, nails, hair, and mucous membranes. We estimate that there are approximately 500,000 patients in the United States with lichen planus. Based on company survey data, treating physicians report that among treated patients with this disease, approximately one in every three experience refractory pruritus. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lichen Simplex Chronicus. Lichen simplex chronicus results from chronic itching and scratching, which causes lichenified skin. Based on company survey data, treating physicians report approximately one lichen simplex chronicus patient for every prurigo nodularis patient, which equates to approximately 300,000 addressable patients in the United States, and among treated patients with lichen simplex chronicus, approximately 40% experience refractory pruritus. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 18 million adults in the United States. Human biopsy studies have shown that the cytokines IL‑31 and OSM and the receptor chains IL‑31Rα and OSMRβ OSMRβ are highly expressed in atopic dermatitis lesions. Based upon public data analyses and discussions with physicians and key opinion leaders in the field, we estimate that approximately 300,000 atopic dermatitis patients in the United States are diagnosed with a moderate‑to‑severe form of this disease that significantly impairs their professional and social life on a daily basis. Current Treatment Landscape for Prurigo Nodularis and Atopic Dermatitis
 Prurigo Nodularis
 We are not aware of any current FDA‑approved therapies for treating prurigo nodularis, and the treatment approach ranges from topical corticosteroids and occlusive steroid containing bandages for more mild patients to systemic corticosteroid, ultraviolet phototherapy and systemic therapies such as thalidomide, methotrexate and cyclosporine for those patients who fail initial treatments. Patients have reported using opioid pain medications to attempt to control the disease in its most severe form. Atopic Dermatitis
 Current therapies for atopic dermatitis are generally focused on the topical use of non‑biologic small molecules, however, dupilumab (subcutaneously injected antibody directed to inhibiting signaling through IL‑4Rα) has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Our Solution
 KPL‑716 is a fully‑human monoclonal antibody that targets two key pathways for the development of pruritus, inflammation and fibrosis through inhibition of OSMRβ. Chronic pruritic diseases are often characterized by a complex interplay among pruritus, inflammation and fibrosis. The pathogenesis of chronic pruritic diseases involves interlocking positive feedback loops in which pruritus causes scratch, and scratch causes reactive inflammation through mechanical disruption of the skin architecture. The decline in skin barrier function and resulting bacterial colonization or infection ultimately increase extracellular matrix formation and collagen deposition, leading to fibrosis. Fibrosis then begets more pruritus through disruption and dysregulation of sensory nerve fiber expression.
 Current therapies target only one or two aspects of this complex pathophysiology and are inevitably limited in their effectiveness. Targeting only one pathway may address a single aspect of the symptomatology, e.g., pruritus, but not the full spectrum of the pathophysiologic components of the disease. This point is particularly relevant since OSM is upregulated in many chronic inflammatory skin diseases and synergistically interacts with pruritic and inflammatory pathways. Of particular relevance is the central role of OSM in inflammation and barrier function and its autocrine effects on type II OSM receptor in IL‑31‑dependent epidermal proliferation and remodeling as well as inflammation.

 
  18

 

 There is a relatively large body of literature linking inflammatory pruritic and inflammatory diseases to both IL‑31 and OSM via signaling though OSMRβ. KPL‑716 has been specifically designed to target both pathways simultaneously and thus KPL‑716 may disrupt this pathologic cycle in patients afflicted by prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis.
 Pre‑clinical Development
 In our pre‑clinical development program we have observed favorable pharmacokinetics and toxicology characteristics to support clinical development of KPL‑716. KPL‑716 has shown signs of efficacy in two non‑human primate models. In the first, KPL‑716 abrogated the pharmacodynamic marker of pruritus in an IL‑31 challenge model. A single three milligram per kilogram dose of KPL‑716 substantially reduced scratch counts despite multiple repeated injections of IL‑31 over several weeks at concentrations we believe to be supraphysiologic in a disease context. In the second non‑human primate model, KPL‑716 again abrogated the painful response to an injection to an inflammatory agent called carrageenan through the time period measured after a single infusion of KPL‑716, implicating OSM in the inflammatory response. We have conducted pre‑clinical toxicology studies for KPL‑716 with a no adverse event level of 500 milligrams per kilogram with intravenous dosing. Phase 1a/1b Clinical Trial
 In early 2017, we filed an IND application and began clinical development with KPL‑716 in a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial in healthy volunteers and in subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus, respectively.
 The first portion of the Phase 1a/1b clinical trial utilized a randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, single‑ascending‑dose, sequential‑group design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of KPL‑716 in healthy volunteers and subjects with atopic dermatitis following IV or SC administration. We used the pruritis in atopic dermatitis as a proxy for IL‑31‑driven pruritic diseases, including prurigo nodularis.
 In total, 50 healthy volunteers and 32 subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus received a single dose of KPL‑716 or placebo in the Phase 1a/1b clinical trial, with the top dose of 20 mg/kg IV in healthy volunteers and 7.5 mg/kg IV in subjects with atopic dermatitis. There was a seven‑day wash out period of prior therapies for all subjects with atopic dermatitis before treatment, and topical corticosteroids, or TCS, were not allowed through day 28. All subjects were given TSC to use as needed after day 28, and rescue medication was provided for atopic dermatitis flares throughout the study. KPL‑716 was well‑tolerated, no dose‑limiting toxicities were observed, and there were no serious adverse events. All drug‑related or potentially drug‑related treatment‑emergent adverse events, or DR‑TEAE, were mild, except for one patient who experienced a moderate DR‑TEAE of dizziness.
 KPL‑716 showed dose‑dependent elimination consistent with a target‑mediated drug disposition profile and was still detectable at least eight weeks after the high dose of 7.5 mg/kg IV in subjects with atopic dermatitis. We believe the available pharmacokinetic and bioavailability data are supportive of testing once every other week or once monthly SC dosing regimens in subsequent studies of KPL‑716.
 An exploratory analysis of data in 10 subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis receiving a single dose of KPL‑716 7.5 mg/kg IV versus 10 pooled placebo IV recipients provided an early signal of efficacy for KPL‑716 in reducing pruritus, indicative of target engagement. Among these groups, we observed:

· | Mean percentage change in weekly‑average Worst‑Itch Numeric Rating Scale, or WI‑NRS, decreased by 40.4% in KPL‑716 recipients compared to a 17.6% decrease in placebo recipients at day 28 in the absence of concomitant TCS.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  19

 


· | Mean percentage change in pruritus Visual Analog Scale, or VAS, decreased by 55.4% in KPL‑716 recipients compared to a 10.4% decrease in placebo recipients at day 28 in the absence of concomitant TCS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 50% of KPL‑716 recipients showed a ≥ 4‑point reduction in weekly‑average WI‑NRS, compared to 10% of placebo recipients at day 28 in the absence of concomitant TCS.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The maximum decrease in WI‑NRS at day 28 in the absence of concomitant TCS was ≥ 8 points (1 subject) in KPL‑716 recipients compared to a maximum decrease of 4 points in placebo recipients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | KPL‑716 appeared to show a persistent effect on weekly‑average WI‑NRS in the period after day 28 through day 56, during which concomitant TCS use was permitted.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | KPL‑716 recipients reported a 59.5% decrease in sleep‑loss VAS compared to a 2.3% decrease in placebo recipients at day 28 in the absence of concomitant TCS.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The mean percentage change in EASI (a standardized measure of atopic dermatitis disease severity) decreased by 42.3% in KPL‑716 recipients compared to a 25% decrease in placebo recipients at Day 28 in absence of concomitant TCS.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We continue to enroll a repeated‑single‑dose cohort as an additional part of the Phase 1b clinical trial in the United States and Canada. In this randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study, subjects with moderate‑to‑severe atopic dermatitis experiencing moderate‑to‑severe pruritus receive 360 mg or placebo via SC injection of KPL‑716 once weekly for 12 weeks. The clinical study is designed to provide similar and longer‑term exposures in order to evaluate safety and chronic efficacy data on both pruritus and inflammation and  disease severity (assessed by EASI) response markers compared to the single‑dose IV cohort in the Phase 1b clinical trial. We expect to report top‑line data from this cohort in the second half of 2019.
 Adaptive Design Phase 2a/2b Clinical Trial in Prurigo Nodularis
 Based on the results from the single‑dose IV Phase 1b results in atopic dermatitis subjects, we intend to initiate an adaptive design Phase 2a/2b randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity of KPL‑716 administered SC in subjects with moderate to severe prurigo nodularis experiencing moderate to severe pruritus. We expect that the Phase 2a portion of the study will enroll up to approximately 100 subjects with moderate to severe prurigo nodularis experiencing moderate to severe pruritus and will include two arms: one active arm and one placebo arm. A total of 16 doses of study drug, administered subcutaneously, once‑weekly for 16 weeks, are planned during the treatment period to assess potential proof of concept in prurigo nodularis on the endpoints of pruritus, sleep, quality of life and disease severity, with dosing to achieve maximum or near‑maximum steady‑state exposures. The primary and key secondary endpoints, which focus on pruritus, are set at 8 weeks. Other secondary endpoints will explore the impact of KPL‑716 versus placebo on pruritus, sleep, quality of life and disease severity over time (at each week of the study treatment period up to and including week 16).
 The Phase 2b portion of the study, if enrolled, will include up to approximately 300 subjects with moderate to severe prurigo nodularis experiencing moderate to severe pruritus and will have five arms: four active arms, testing different dose levels or dosing regimens of KPL‑716, and one placebo arm. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2b portion will also focus on pruritus at week 8, with other secondary endpoints evaluating pruritus, sleep, quality of life and disease severity over time.
 Exploratory Multi‑Indication, Pilot Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 We believe there are multiple chronic pruritic diseases where IL‑31 and OSM may play a role in disease pathology. In the first half of 2019, we plan to initiate an exploratory, multi‑indication, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, pilot clinical trial designed to (1) explore the role of IL‑31 and OSM in a number of diseases 

 
  20

 
characterized by chronic pruritus seen by dermatologists or allergists and (2) investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KPL‑716 in reducing the moderate to severe pruritus experienced by these subjects. We currently expect the study populations to be chronic idiopathic urticaria, chronic idiopathic pruritus, plaque psoriasis, lichen planus, and lichen simplex chronicus.
 The trial will be comprised of multiple cohorts, each for a different study population. Each cohort will be an independent sub‑study assessing each study population for presence of an IL‑31 or OSM protein or ribonucleic acid signature via biopsy and investigating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KPL‑716 administered SC in reducing pruritus in these populations. Investigators and subjects will remain blinded throughout the study. We expect each cohort to enroll up to approximately 26 subjects with each subject experiencing WI‑NRS of seven or above at screening. A loading dose of KPL‑716 (720 mg) or matching placebo will be administered on day 1, followed by single, weekly SC injections of KPL‑716 (360 mg) or matching placebo for the next seven weeks, with the goal of achieving maximum or near maximum exposures at steady state. The goal of this exploratory study is to identify chronic pruritic conditions where IL‑31 or OSM may be playing a role and assess the presence or absence of reduction in pruritus after KPL‑716 treatment.
 Pre‑clinical Development
 KPL‑404
 KPL‑404 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to inhibit the CD40‑CD40 ligand interaction, a key T‑cell co‑stimulatory signal critical for B‑cell maturation and immunoglobulin class switching. Since September 2017, we have had a license to conduct research and development on KPL‑404 from Primatope, the company that owned or controlled the intellectual property related to KPL‑404 and, in March 2019, we acquired the company. 
 In pre‑clinical development, KPL‑404 has been observed to have a favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicology profile to support further pre-clinical development. KPL‑404 has been effective in multiple non‑human primate models of organ transplant rejection, as well as in multiple T‑cell dependent antibody response models. We are continuing our pre‑clinical activities in KPL‑404 in T‑cell dependent, B‑cell mediated diseases, and expect to file an IND application with the FDA for this program in the second half of 2019 and to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2020. 
 KPL‑045
 KPL‑045 is a fully‑human monoclonal antibody that is designed to inhibit the CD30‑CD30 ligand interaction, a co‑stimulatory signal helpful in activating and sustaining memory T‑cells. The majority of the therapeutics in development modulating the CD30‑CD30 ligand interaction are depleting or conjugated to a toxin for the use in hematological malignancies. To our knowledge, KPL‑045 is the only non‑depleting antibody targeting primarily autoimmune disease in active clinical development. In August 2017, we licensed this antibody from Novo Nordisk.
 In pre‑clinical development, KPL‑045 has been observed to have a pharmacokinetic profile that supported further pre-clinical development. KPL‑045 has showed single‑digit nanomolar potency against both human and cynomolgus non‑human primate CD30L. We are currently evaluating the progression of KPL-045 pending preclinical data from the program in the context of our portfolio.  
 Discovery Activities
 We have initiated internal discovery activities directed toward wholly owned molecules for the treatment of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease targets where we believe there to be a strong mechanistic rationale and clear differentiation from existing approved agents or those in development.

 License and Acquisition Agreements
 License Agreement with Regeneron
 In September 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Regeneron, or the Regeneron Agreement. Pursuant to the Regeneron Agreement, Regeneron granted us an exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by Regeneron to develop and commercialize rilonacept worldwide, aside from Israel, Egypt, Turkey and select countries in the Middle East and northern Africa, which we refer to collectively as the Excluded Territory. In the United States and Japan, our license is initially for all indications other than those involving local administration to the eye or ear, oncology, deficiency of the interleukin‑1 receptor antagonist, or DIRA, and CAPS. If we are successful in receiving marketing approval for rilonacept in the United States for a new indication, the scope of the license granted to us will automatically expand to include DIRA and CAPS in the United States and Japan, and we will assume the sales and distribution of rilonacept in these additional indications. Outside the Unites States and Japan, our license is for all indications other than local application to the eye or ear, oncology, CAPS, DIRA and certain periodic fever syndromes set forth in the Regeneron Agreement, collectively the Excluded Indications. Under the Regeneron Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize rilonacept outside of the Excluded Indications in our territory. Upon receiving positive data in a Phase 3 clinical trial, Regeneron will transfer the BLA for rilonacept to us.
 We made an upfront payment of $5.0 million to Regeneron and are obligated to make regulatory milestone payments of up to $27.5 million in the aggregate. Thereafter, we have agreed to evenly split profits on our sales of rilonacept with Regeneron after deducting certain commercialization expenses subject to specified limits.
 Regeneron has a right of first negotiation over our engagement of third parties to support our promotional activities in excess of a specified level and over the assignment or sale of our rights to any product we develop under the Regeneron Agreement to a third‑party. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we will need Regeneron’s prior consent to assign our rights under the Regeneron Agreement.
 The Regeneron Agreement will expire on the date on which we, our affiliates or sublicensees are no longer developing or commercializing any product containing rilonacept. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time after the date that is 18 months after the effective date of the agreement with 180 days’ written notice or one year’s written notice if we terminate the agreement following U.S. marketing approval of a rilonacept product developed by us. We may also terminate with three months’ written notice if we reasonably determine that rilonacept is unsafe in the indications we are pursuing. Regeneron may terminate the agreement if there is a consecutive twelve (12) month period during which we do not conduct any material development or commercialization activities or we do not grant a sublicense to a third‑party to do so, or if we challenge Regeneron’s patent rights in any country in our territory. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days for payment‑related breaches), or by either party due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
 We have also entered into a clinical supply agreement with Regeneron, or the Supply Agreement. Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, Regeneron has the exclusive right to manufacture and supply all of our requirements of rilonacept for clinical development. If Regeneron determines to discontinue the supply of rilonacept to us, it must use its reasonable efforts to transfer all relevant documentation, materials and technology necessary for the manufacture of rilonacept to us or our designee. The Supply Agreement terminates upon the termination of the Regeneron Agreement or the transfer of technology related to the bulk manufacture of rilonacept.
 License Agreement with MedImmune
 In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with MedImmune, or the MedImmune Agreement. Pursuant to the MedImmune Agreement, MedImmune granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by MedImmune to make, use, develop and commercialize mavrilimumab and any other product containing an antibody to the GM‑CSF receptor alpha that is covered by certain MedImmune patent rights for all indications. We also acquired non‑exclusive licenses to other MedImmune technology for use in exploiting licensed products. We may sublicense these rights subject to consent of MedImmune and any applicable licensors of 

 
  22

 
rights under which we are licensed. We also acquired reference rights to relevant manufacturing and regulatory documents, and existing inventory of mavrilimumab drug substance. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products.
 We made an upfront payment of $8.0 million to MedImmune and are obligated to make future clinical, regulatory and initial sales milestone payments of up to $72.5 million in the aggregate for the first two indications, including a milestone payment of $10.0 million which we paid upon the occurrence of a specified regulatory milestone, and clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to $15.0 million in the aggregate for each subsequent indication. We are also obligated to make milestone payments to MedImmune of up to $85.0 million upon the achievement of annual net sales thresholds up to, but excluding, $1.0 billion in annual net sales as well as additional milestone payments aggregating up to $1.1 billion upon the achievement of additional annual net sales thresholds starting at $1.0 billion and higher. Commencing on the first commercial sale of licensed products, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on escalating tiers of annual net sales of licensed products starting in the low double‑digit percentages and ending at twenty percent. We must pay such royalties on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of licensed patents, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 In countries where licensed patents have issued, the statutory expiration date is 2027, not including any patent term extensions or adjustments. While the current expected patent expiration dates are known in countries where licensed patents have issued, these expiration dates are subject to significant uncertainty. For example, the patents may be challenged, and accordingly, the relevant expiration dates could be shortened. In addition, as we continue to file and prosecute patent applications related to mavrilimumab, the granting of pending applications or future patent applications could extend the relevant statutory expiration dates beyond 2027. The expiration date of regulatory exclusivity is determined on a country‑by country‑basis if the applicable product is approved in such country and if any applicable regulatory exclusivity applies and is granted. The actual expiration date of any such regulatory exclusivity, however, is subject to significant uncertainty. For instance, the applicable regulatory exclusivity period is often triggered by the date a product candidate obtains regulatory approval, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether and if so, when, the applicable product would receive regulatory approval in any given jurisdiction. Furthermore, the type, scope and duration of such exclusivities will vary on a country‑by‑country basis depending on the jurisdictions in which a product candidate is approved and the particular regulatory exclusivity for which the product is eligible as of the time of approval. For example, in the United States, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, which means that the FDA cannot make effective the approval of a biosimilar product that references the biologic product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing may qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The two‑year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. Furthermore, if a product candidate that has received orphan designation is subsequently approved for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which generally grants seven years of market exclusivity in the United States and up to 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union, and such period may run contemporaneously with the other exclusivities that may apply. In the European Union, an orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity for pediatric studies. In the United States, an additional six‑month period of pediatric exclusivity may be available as an extension to any existing non‑patent regulatory exclusivity period if the sponsor has conducted and submitted pediatric studies in response to a written request from the FDA. Additionally, our eligibility for regulatory exclusivity may depend in part on the indications for which we seek regulatory approval of our product candidates, which may depend on the data we receive from our clinical studies, and accordingly, may change over time, and the laws and regulations governing regulatory exclusivity may change in various jurisdictions as the political focus on drug exclusivity increases. For risk related to regulatory exclusivity matters, see “Risk factors—Risks related to product development and regulatory approval.”
 The MedImmune Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the royalty term in all countries for all licensed products. The MedImmune Agreement may be terminated earlier at any time by us with at least 90 days’ prior notice, by either party in the event of material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days, by either party for insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, or immediately by MedImmune if we challenge the licensed patents.

 Biogen Asset Purchase Agreement
 In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Biogen pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, or the Biogen Agreement. Pursuant to the Biogen Agreement, we acquired all of Biogen’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets used in or relating to KPL‑716 and other antibodies covered by certain patent rights, together the Acquired Assets, including patents and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, know‑how and inventory. In addition, Biogen granted us a non‑exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain background patent rights related the KPL‑716 program. Under the Biogen Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the Acquired Assets.
 Under the Biogen Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $11.5 million and a technology transfer payment of $0.5 million to Biogen. In addition, we made a milestone payment of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with the achievement of a specified clinical milestone event. We are also obligated to make future milestone payments for each antibody product that includes the Acquired Assets, or an Antibody Product, of up to $325.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified milestones. These milestone payments relate to multiple indications for an Antibody Product, and are comprised of up to $175.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestone events and $150.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified annual net sales thresholds. Commencing on the first commercial sale of an Antibody Product, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties on escalating tiers of annual net sales of licensed products starting in the high single‑digit percentages and ending below the teens. We must pay such royalties on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of patents that cover an Antibody Product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such product in such country. We have also agreed to pay certain obligations under third‑party contracts retained by Biogen that relate to KPL‑716.
 In countries where patents covering Antibody Products have issued, the statutory expiration date is 2034, not including any patent term extensions or adjustments. While the current expected patent expiration dates are known in countries where licensed patents have issued, these expiration dates are subject to significant uncertainty. For example, the patents may be challenged, and accordingly, the relevant expiration dates could be shortened. In addition, as we continue to file and prosecute patent applications related to Antibody Products, the granting of pending applications or future patent applications could extend the relevant statutory expiration dates beyond 2034. The expiration date of regulatory exclusivity is determined on a country‑by country‑basis if the applicable product is approved in such country and if any applicable regulatory exclusivity applies and is granted. The actual expiration date of any such regulatory exclusivity, however, is subject to significant uncertainty. For instance, the applicable regulatory exclusivity period is often triggered by the date a product candidate obtains regulatory approval, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether and if so, when, the applicable product would receive regulatory approval in any given jurisdiction. Furthermore, the type, scope and duration of such exclusivities will vary on a country‑by‑country basis depending on the jurisdictions in which a product candidate is approved and the particular regulatory exclusivity for which the product is eligible as of the time of approval. For example, in the United States, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, which means that the FDA cannot make effective the approval of a biosimilar product that references the biologic product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing may qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The two‑year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. Furthermore, if a product candidate that has received orphan designation is subsequently approved for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which generally grants seven years of market exclusivity in the United States and up to 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union, and such period may run contemporaneously with the other exclusivities that may apply. In the European Union, an orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity for pediatric studies. In the United States, an additional six‑month period of pediatric exclusivity may be available as an extension to any existing non‑patent regulatory exclusivity period if the sponsor has conducted and submitted pediatric studies in response to a written request from the FDA. Additionally, our eligibility for regulatory exclusivity may depend in part on the indications for which we seek regulatory approval of our product candidates, which may depend on the data we receive from our clinical studies, and accordingly, may change over time, and the laws and regulations governing regulatory exclusivity may change in various jurisdictions as the political focus on drug exclusivity increases.

For risk related to regulatory exclusivity matters, see “Risk factors—Risks related to product development and regulatory approval.”
 Under the Biogen Agreement, Biogen has a time‑limited right of first negotiation to purchase the assets we acquired from Biogen or obtain a license to exploit Antibody Products, in each case, in the event we decide to sell the acquired assets, including through the sale of our company, or out‑license the rights to the Antibody Products.
 The Biogen Agreement will remain in effect until expiration of all payment obligations in all countries related to the last antibody product subject to the Biogen Agreement. The Biogen Agreement may be terminated by us with 90 days’ prior notice, by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days for payment‑related breaches) or by both parties upon mutual consent. In the event of a termination, the Acquired Assets, including certain licenses and rights related thereto, will revert to Biogen, and, upon written request by Biogen, we are required to grant to Biogen an exclusive, worldwide, sub‑licensable license to certain of our intellectual property related to the Acquired Assets, including know‑how and patent rights.
 Manufacturing 
 We do not currently own or operate any large‑scale manufacturing facilities. Although we built small‑scale manufacturing facilities to produce drug substance to support certain of our pre‑clinical and clinical studies, we rely on third parties to manufacture all of our product candidates. We have entered into a clinical supply agreement with Regeneron to manufacture and supply rilonacept for our clinical trials. Regeneron has also agreed to provide commercial drug material until at least the later of four years after U.S. marketing approval or seven years after the effective date of the agreement.
 We believe that we have sufficient quantities of drug substance to supply our Phase 2 clinical trial of mavrilimumab for the treatment of GCA. We also acquired a certain amount of finished mavrilimumab drug product that we plan to use in this clinical trial, and have entered into a fill/finish supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to produce additional finished mavrilimumab drug product from our current inventory of drug substance. In addition, we transferred the manufacturing process of mavrilimumab to, and entered into an agreement with, the same CMO to produce mavrilimumab drug substance beyond our existing inventory for other clinical trials, including any Phase 3 clinical trial, and eventual commercialization of mavrilimumab, if approved. There are certain components, for example, media and feed, used to produce our current mavrilimumab inventory that the CMO is not able to use in our future manufacturing process. We and this CMO or any other CMO that we enter into agreement with to manufacture mavrilimumab will need to find alternative components to replace the media and feed that had been used by MedImmune to date in the manufacture of mavrilimumab.
 We acquired a certain amount of KPL‑716 drug substance from Biogen from which we produced KPL‑716 drug product using a CMO. In addition, we have engaged CMOs to manufacture KPL‑716 drug substance and product for further clinical development activities. We intend to use CMOs for development and scale‑up work for any future clinical trials and eventual commercialization of KPL‑716, if approved.
 We engaged CMOs to produce our pre‑clinical product candidates for certain pre-clinical studies, but we intend to produce our pre-clinical product candidates for Phase 1 studies in our own small‑scale manufacturing facilities. Longer‑term, we expect to use CMOs to produce these product candidates for later‑phase clinical studies and eventual commercialization, if approved.

 
  25

 

 We require our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight of our CMOs. We currently rely solely on these third‑party manufacturers for scale‑up and process development work and to produce sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in pre‑clinical studies and clinical trials. Although we have established our own small‑scale manufacturing capabilities to support certain pre‑clinical and early clinical‑stage production of product candidates, we intend to continue to rely on third‑party manufacturers for clinical and commercial supply of our product candidates. We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial‑scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with any of these CMOs to cover commercial production. We also may elect to pursue additional CMOs for manufacturing supplies of drug substance and finished drug product in the future.
 Commercial Operations  
 Our team is experienced in commercial leadership and we intend to expand our capabilities in parallel with the development path of our product candidates. If the FDA approves rilonacept for recurrent pericarditis, we intend to market and commercialize rilonacept in the United States by developing our own sales, marketing and medical affairs organizations targeting a subset of cardiologists and rheumatologists currently treating pericarditis. For our other product candidates, we intend to establish commercialization strategies for each as we approach potential marketing approval and, due to the specialization among physicians treating the indications we are targeting, we expect to be able leverage our then‑existing sales, marketing and medical affairs organizations. Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, including rilonacept, mavrilimumab and KPL‑716, may compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre‑clinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early‑stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of rilonacept, mavrilimumab and KPL‑716, and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third‑party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 We are aware of the following products currently marketed or in clinical development for the treatment of the diseases that we are initially targeting:

 
  26

 

 Rilonacept
 We are not aware of any therapies currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis, our lead indication for rilonacept. Anakinra (KINERET), produced by Sobi, Inc., is an FDA‑approved agent that inhibits IL‑1α and IL‑1β signaling and is approved for RA and CAPS. Canakinumab (ILARIS), produced by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, is a monoclonal antibody which inhibits IL‑1β signaling and is approved for use in CAPS, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated period syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome, familiar Mediterranean fever and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. There are also other therapies modulating IL‑1α or IL‑1β which are in various stages of clinical development for diseases other than recurrent pericarditis from AbbVie, Inc., or AbbVie, XBiotech Inc. and Handok Inc. Mavrilimumab
 GCA: Tocilizumab (ACTEMRA), produced by Hoffmann—La Roche AG, or Roche, and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is an IL‑6 inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of GCA on top of a concomitant corticosteroid taper. In addition, Eli Lilly and AbbVie are conducting clinical trials for oral janus kinase inhibitors. Sanofi S.A. and Regeneron are recruiting a Phase 3 clinical trial with their anti‑IL‑6 program, Novartis International AG, is recruiting a trial with their IL-17 antagonist secukinumab (Cosentyx) and Janssen’s ustekinumab (STELARA) is being trialed in two small studies for GCA.
 GM-CSF antagonists: There are also four other programs in clinical development in various indications that modulate GM‑CSF signaling from GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK, Izana Bioscience Ltd., I-MAB Biopharma and Humanigen, Inc.
 KPL‑716
 We are not aware of any therapies currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of prurigo nodularis. Menlo Therapeutics Inc., Trevi Therapeutics, Inc. and Galderma SA, or Galderma, have programs in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of prurigo nodularis.
 The FDA recently approved Regeneron’s dupilumab, an antibody that inhibits signaling through the interleukin 4 receptor, to treat atopic dermatitis. Other companies currently developing systemic therapies for atopic dermatitis include Roche, Dermira, Inc., Galderma, Asana BioSciences, LLC, Eli Lilly and Co., Pfizer Inc., AbbVie, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., GSK, LEO Pharma Inc., Incyte Corporation, Dermavant Sciences, Inc., Novartis International AG, MedImmune, and AnaptsysBio, Inc.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know‑how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We plan to protect our proprietary position using a variety of methods, which include pursuing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements, including compositions of matter, drug product formulations, and methods‑of‑use, that are important to the development and implementation of our business. For example, we or our licensors have or are pursuing patents covering the composition of matter for each of our product candidates and we generally pursue patent protection covering methods‑of‑use for each clinical program. We also rely on trade secrets, know‑how, continuing technological innovation and potential in‑licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We have a field‑specific exclusive license under the Regeneron Agreement to granted patents and pending applications in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to rilonacept. As of December 31, 2018, the patent rights in‑licensed under the Regeneron Agreement relating to our program include one granted patent in the United States and 54 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and selected countries in Europe and Asia. In addition, the patent rights in‑licensed under the Regeneron Agreement relating to our program include patent applications that are pending in the United States. A U.S. patent covering rilonacept as a composition of 

 
  27

 
matter has a statutory expiration date in 2019, not including patent term adjustment, and relevant foreign counterparts are expected to expire between 2019 and 2023, in each case, not including any patent term extensions. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of rilonacept for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and receive orphan designation, we would rely on orphan exclusivity, which generally grants seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States and 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe. See “—License agreement with Regeneron” above for additional information on our rights under the Regeneron Agreement.
 We have an exclusive license under the MedImmune Agreement to granted patents and pending patent applications in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to mavrilimumab. These patents and patent applications cover mavrilimumab as a composition of matter and its use. As of December 31, 2018, the patent rights in‑licensed under the MedImmune Agreement relating to our program include three granted patents in the United States and 106 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia and selected countries in Europe and Asia. In addition, the patent rights in‑licensed under the MedImmune Agreement relating to our program include patent applications that are pending in the United States and selected countries in Asia and Latin America. The composition of matter patents for mavrilimumab generally have statutory expiration dates in 2027, although the term of some U.S. patents may be longer due to patent term adjustment to compensate for delays during the patent prosecution process. Patent term extension could extend the expiration date of one patent in the United States and patents in certain other jurisdictions, each in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurances that patents will issue from any pending patent applications. See “—License agreement with MedImmune” above for additional information on our rights under the MedImmune Agreement.
 We own, via our acquisition of certain assets from Biogen, granted patents and pending patent applications in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to KPL‑716. These patents and patent applications cover KPL‑716 as a composition of matter and its use. As of December 31, 2018, the patent rights acquired from Biogen include three patents granted in the United States and 30 patents granted in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Mexico and selected countries in Europe and Asia. In addition, the patent rights acquired from Biogen include patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, Canada, and selected countries in Asia. The issued composition of matter patents for KPL‑716 have statutory expiration dates in 2034. Patent term extension could extend the expiration date of one patent in the United States and patents in certain other jurisdictions, each in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of our pending patent applications. See “—Biogen asset purchase agreement” above for additional information on our rights under the Biogen Agreement.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non‑provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier expiring patent. In certain countries, the term of a patent that covers a drug product may also be eligible for patent term extension when regulatory approval is granted, provided the legal requirements are met. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products, such as rilonacept, mavrilimumab and our other product candidates. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.

 
  28

 

 U.S. Government Regulation of Biological Products
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending biologic license applications, or BLAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | Completion of extensive pre‑clinical studies and tests in accordance with applicable regulations, including Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission to FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical‑trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission to FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of pre‑clinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A determination by FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre‑approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potential FDA audit of the pre‑clinical or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pre‑clinical Studies
 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous pre‑clinical testing. The pre‑clinical development stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of the chemistry, formulation and stability of the product candidate, as well as trials to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre‑clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre‑clinical studies, 

 
  29

 
together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some pre‑clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease‑affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease‑affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Post‑approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long‑term safety follow up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.

 
  30

 

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time or the FDA may impose other sanctions on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can refuse, suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional pre‑clinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Review and Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre‑clinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy and may include both negative and ambiguous results of pre‑clinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company‑sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
 Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re‑analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific 

 
  31

 
REMS provisions, on a case‑by‑case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric population for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre‑clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) or other significant and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre‑clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the re‑submitted BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post‑approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user‑fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in 

 
  32

 
limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, by providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication that could be used “off‑label” by physicians in the orphan indication, even though the competitor’s product is not approved in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do of the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life‑threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs and biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 In addition, under the provisions of the or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life‑threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a product receiving accelerated approval to perform post‑marketing trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures.
 Once a BLA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if the FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months, compared to ten months for a standard review. Most products that are eligible for fast track or breakthrough therapy designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.

 
  33

 

 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 Post‑approval Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off‑label use”) and limitations on industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off‑label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre‑clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non‑compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary recall.
 Once an approval or clearance of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or other enforcement‑related letters or clinical holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  34

 


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA‑licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. A recent federal district court ruling struck down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. This decision means numerous reforms enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, but not specifically related to health insurance, such as the BPCIA, are invalid as well. While the presidential administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case‑by‑case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12‑year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.

 U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension must be based on the first approval for the product, and the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond fourteen years from approval. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. European Union Drug Development, Review and Approval
 In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre‑clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an IMPD (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the competent national authority and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation is anticipated to come into application in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.

 
  36

 

 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAA, either under the so‑called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized Procedure
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced‑therapy medicines (such as gene‑therapy, somatic cell‑therapy or tissue‑engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop‑clocks. National Authorization Procedures
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
· | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk‑benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 European Union Regulatory Exclusivity
 In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the pre‑clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten‑year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

 
  37

 

 European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The ten‑year market exclusivity in the European Union may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:

· | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

  Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, other U.S., federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti‑kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.
 The U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical and medical device 

 
  38

 
manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti‑kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers, or to self‑pay patients.
 The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several biopharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., off‑label), and thus non‑covered, uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement of profits and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, new annual 

 
  39

 
reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals (and additional categories of health care practitioners beginning with reports due on or after January 1, 2022), as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year and the reported information is publicly made available on a searchable website. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, although it is unclear that we would be considered a “business associate” in the normal course of our business. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, anti‑fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals, may apply to us to the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a country other than the United States.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.
 Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement of profits, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non‑compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of its operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government‑paid healthcare costs, including price‑controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded 

 
  40

 
drug and biologic products. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed products generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Providers and patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. If approved, sales of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
 In the United States, the process for determining whether a third‑party payor will provide coverage for a biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. With respect to biologics, third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost‑sharing obligation imposed on patients. A decision by a third‑party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of a product. Moreover, a third‑party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third‑party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately and is a time‑consuming process.
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third‑party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If third‑party payors do not consider a product to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover that product after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a manufacturer to sell its product at a profit.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In the European Union, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low‑priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 Healthcare Reform and Potential Changes to Healthcare Laws
 The FDAs and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to 

 
  41

 
modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDAs user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third‑party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The current Presidential administration and members of the U.S. Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the BPCIA, are invalid as well. While the presidential administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and that will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress; and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biologic products.
 Individual states in the United States have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control biotechnology and pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

 We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services.
