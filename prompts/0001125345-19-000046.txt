Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative antibody-based therapeutics designed to modulate the human immune response for the treatment of cancer. We currently have a pipeline of product candidates in human clinical testing, including nine immuno-oncology programs, that have been created primarily using our proprietary antibody-based technology platforms. 
We are developing product candidates that target various tumor-associated antigens, including HER2. We currently have a franchise of three product candidates in clinical trials that target B7-H3, a molecule in the B7 family of immune regulator proteins. B7-H3 is widely expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response to various types of cancer. There are no currently approved therapeutic agents directed against B7-H3. We are also developing a franchise of three molecules that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This protein is important in the regulation of the immune system’s response to cancer, and monoclonal antibodies that inhibit PD-1 have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of numerous cancers. Within our PD-1 franchise, in addition to an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that we’ve out-licensed to a partner, we are also developing two bispecific DART product candidates that engage PD-1 and LAG-3, as well as PD-1 and CTLA-4. 
We have created our product candidates based on the following antibody-based technologies:
•Fc Optimization platform, which introduces certain mutations into the Fc domain of a monoclonal antibody in order to modulate antibody interaction with immune effector cells to enhance the killing of cancer cells; 
•Multi-specific platforms, which enable us to design antibodies that have the ability to bind to two (in the case of our bispecific DART product candidates) or more distinct targets; and
•Antibody drug conjugate (ADC) platforms, which we have licensed from collaboration partners, and which link monoclonal antibodies that specifically target cytotoxins to cancer cells that are designed to trigger cell death in the cancer cell.
Our Pipeline of Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
The table below depicts the current status of product candidates that are in clinical development and for which we retain all or some commercial rights:
(a) MGC018 is an ADC based on a duocarmycin payload with cleavable peptide linker that was licensed from Synthon Biopharmaceuticals.
(b) MacroGenics retains rights to develop its pipeline assets in combination with MGA012 and to manufacture a portion of global clinical and commercial supply needs of MGA012. Incyte designates this molecule as “INCMGA0012”.
Margetuximab
Margetuximab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets HER2-expressing tumors, including certain types of breast and gastroesophageal cancers. HER2 is critical for the growth of many types of tumors. Using our Fc Optimization platform, we have engineered the constant region (Fc region) of margetuximab to increase its ability to kill tumor cells through an Fc-dependent mechanism, including antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer. In February 2019, we announced positive results from SOPHIA, our Phase 3 clinical trial of margetuximab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. The SOPHIA clinical trial met the trial’s first primary endpoint of prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with the combination of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. Patients in the margetuximab arm experienced a 24% risk reduction in PFS compared to patients in the trastuzumab arm (HR=0.76, p=0.033). Notably, approximately 85% of patients in the study were carriers of the CD16A (FcγRIIIa) 158F allele, which has been previously associated with diminished clinical response to trastuzumab and other antibodies. In this pre-specified subpopulation, patients in the margetuximab arm experienced a 32% risk reduction in PFS compared to patients in the trastuzumab arm (HR=0.68, p=0.005). Results of the SOPHIA study have been submitted for presentation later this year at a major scientific conference. Follow-up for determination of the impact of therapy on the sequential second primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) is ongoing, as pre-specified in the study protocol and recommended by the trial’s independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of margetuximab for treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced HER2 positive breast cancer who have previously been treated with anti-HER2-targeted therapy. We anticipate submitting a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for margetuximab on the basis of the PFS results in the second half of 2019.
The SOPHIA study enrolled 536 patients at approximately 200 trial sites across North America, Europe and Asia. The study evaluated margetuximab in a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who had received at least two prior lines of anti-HER2-directed therapy in the metastatic setting, or in the case of having received (neo)adjuvant pertuzumab, at least one prior line of anti-HER2-directed therapy in the metastatic setting, and who have received at least one and no more than three prior lines of therapy overall in the metastatic setting. Patients were treated with either margetuximab or trastuzumab in combination with one of four chemotherapy agents (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine). All study patients had previously received trastuzumab and pertuzumab, and approximately 90% had previously received ado-trastuzumab emtansine. The combination of margetuximab and chemotherapy demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability, comparable overall to that of trastuzumab and chemotherapy.
Gastric Cancer. We are also evaluating margetuximab in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. The Phase 2 clinical trial seeks to characterize the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and antitumor activity of this combination. Enrolled patients had relapsed or refractory advanced HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer with disease progression after or resistance to treatment with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. The 25 patients in the most recently enrolled expansion cohort had HER2-positive gastric carcinoma that was 3+ by immunohistochemistry. Patients in the study were enrolled irrespective of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status.
As of a January 8, 2019 data cut-off date, objective responses were observed in 18 of 55 HER2-positive (as indicated by a 3+ score on an immunohistochemistry test) response-evaluable gastric cancer patients, including 14 confirmed and 4 unconfirmed. The objective response rate (ORR) for this population was 32.7%, with a disease control rate (DCR) (which includes partial responses and stable disease) of 69.1%. Median PFS was 4.7 months. In the subset of these patients who were also PD-L1 positive, objective responses were observed in 12 of 23 (52.2%) patients, with a DCR of 82.6% and PFS of 4.14 months. As of the data cut-off date, the study was ongoing with 13 gastric cancer patients remaining on therapy. The median OS had not been reached in either of these groups. Acceptable tolerability was observed in the safety population of 95 patients, 92 of whom were treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 15 mg/kg for margetuximab and 200mg for the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, both on an every three week schedule of administration. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17.9% of patients, the most common of which was infusion-related reaction (3.2%). Following up on these results, during the first quarter of 2019, we discussed development plans with the FDA for a proposed Phase 2/3 registration-directed study of margetuximab in combination with MGA012, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. This approach is designed to coordinately engage both innate and adaptive immunity with a chemotherapy-free regimen for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer in the first line setting. We expect to initiate this study in the second half of 2019. We also plan to evaluate the merits of combining margetuximab with chemotherapy and MGA012 or MGD013, a PD-1 x LAG-3 bispecific DART molecule, in a randomized, controlled study.
In November 2018, we licensed the right to develop and commercialize margetuximab in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan to Zai Lab Limited (Zai Lab). Zai Lab will lead clinical development in its territory by leveraging its
 regulatory and clinical development expertise and broad regional network of investigators. In 2010, we licensed the right to develop and commercialize margetuximab in South Korea to Green Cross Corporation (GC Pharma).
B7-H3 Franchise
We are developing multiple product candidates targeting B7-H3, a protein in the B7 family of immune regulator proteins. B7-H3 is widely expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response to various types of cancer. There are no currently approved therapeutic agents directed against B7-H3. We have three clinical product candidates directed against B7-H3: enoblituzumab, MGD009 and MGC018. 
Enoblituzumab. The most advanced product candidate in our B7-H3 franchise, enoblituzumab, is a monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 and has been enhanced using our Fc Optimization platform. 
We conducted a Phase 1 clinical study of the combination of enoblituzumab and an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody to evaluate the combination in patients with B7-H3-expressing melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial cancer. A total of 133 patients were treated in the study and the data cut-off date was October 12, 2018.
In the SCCHN dose expansion cohort, of the response-evaluable patients who had not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, 6 of 18 (33.3%) had confirmed partial responses (PRs). For the subset of patients with B7-H3 tumor expression ≥ 10%, 6 of 15 (40.0%) had confirmed PRs. Objective response rates ranging from 13% to 16% have previously been reported in SCCHN patients treated with anti-PD-1 alone. In the NSCLC dose expansion cohort, of the response-evaluable patients who had not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy and who were PD-L1 negative (i.e., PD-L1 ≤ 1%), 5 of 14 (35.7%) had confirmed PRs. Objective response rates ranging from 8% to 17% have previously been reported in PD-L1 negative NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 alone. The combination of enoblituzumab and an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated acceptable tolerability in patients treated to date, with any adverse event ≥ Grade 3 occurring in 27.1% of patients. The rate of immune-related adverse events experienced in the trial was comparable to that observed in patients who received anti-PD-1 as monotherapy. Based on these results, we intend to commence a Phase 2 study of enoblituzumab in combination with MGA012, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with SCCHN beginning in the second half of 2019.
MGD009. MGD009 is one of several clinical-stage molecules developed using our proprietary bispecific DART platform, which is described in greater detail below. Unlike standard monoclonal antibodies, DART molecules are bispecific, which means they can be directed against two different biological targets, and therefore lend themselves to a variety of different applications. MGD009 is a DART molecule that is designed to target both B7-H3 expressed on tumor cells as well as CD3, which is expressed on normal T cells. In preclinical models, MGD009 has re-directed T cells to reduce or eliminate B7-H3 expressing tumors. We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of MGD009 in patients with B7-H3 positive tumors and in a separate study that combines MGD009 and MGA012. 
In December 2018, the FDA imposed a partial clinical hold on these studies, which was subsequently lifted in January 2019. The partial clinical hold was initiated following our reporting to the FDA of hepatic adverse events on the MGD009 monotherapy trial. Although these events had been otherwise uncomplicated and short-lived in duration, we communicated to the FDA our plans to amend the then existing MGD009 studies with additional supportive care to mitigate these events. The FDA placed the trials on partial clinical hold, pending review of additional details regarding such events and satisfactory review of the then planned amendments to the study protocols and related documents. Under the partial clinical hold, which was lifted in January 2019, no new patients were permitted to be enrolled in either study, although then-current study participants were permitted to continue to receive drug at their pre-assigned dose. 
MCG018. Our third B7-H3-directed molecule is MGC018, an ADC that is designed to target solid tumors expressing B7-H3. We initiated a Phase 1 dose escalation study of MGC018 in the fourth quarter of 2018.
PD-1 Franchise
We are pursuing multiple approaches for targeting PD-1. Marketed antibodies targeting this checkpoint molecule have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of various tumors by releasing the "brakes" on the immune system which is often seen when tumors evade detection by the immune system.
MGA012. MGA012 is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody we licensed to Incyte Corporation (Incyte) in 2017 under a global collaboration and license agreement, although we retain the right to develop the molecule in combination with product candidates from our pipeline. Incyte is pursuing development of MGA012 through registration-directed studies in MSI-high endometrial cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma and anal cancer, with initial data anticipated in 2020, in the case of MSI-high endometrial cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma, and 2021, in the case of anal cancer. Incyte is also pursuing development of MGA012 in combination with multiple product candidates from its pipeline. We are currently studying MGA012 in
 combination with two of our DART molecules, MGD009 and MGD007, and we intend to commence additional studies of MGA012 in combination with other product candidates from our own pipeline.
MGD013. Monoclonal antibodies that target the immune checkpoints PD-1 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) have shown enhanced clinical antitumor activity when given in combination. Recognizing the therapeutic potential of dual checkpoint blockade, we have engineered MGD013, a first-in-class bispecific DART molecule, to bind PD-1 and LAG-3 concomitantly or independently and disrupt these non-redundant inhibitory pathways to further restore exhausted T-cell function. We anticipate that MGD013, if approved, could be used for the treatment of a wide range of cancers, including both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. We have established the dose and schedule for MGD013 administration and initiated dose expansion in up to nine tumor types in a Phase 1 study. We expect to present data from this ongoing study in 2019.
MGD019. Approved monoclonal antibodies that target the immune checkpoints PD-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) have shown enhanced clinical antitumor activity when given in combination in various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and NSCLC with high tumor mutational burden. MGD019, a bispecific DART molecule in our pipeline, was designed to enable co-blockade of two immune checkpoint molecules co-expressed on T cells, PD-1 and CTLA-4. We are currently evaluating MGD019 in a Phase 1 dose escalation study.
Flotetuzumab
Flotetuzumab is a bispecific, humanized DART molecule that recognizes both CD123 and CD3. CD123, the Interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain, has been reported to be over-expressed on cancer cells in a wide range of hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). AML and MDS are thought to arise in and be perpetuated by a small population of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that generally resist conventional chemotherapeutic agents. LSCs are characterized by high levels of CD123 expression that is low or absent in the corresponding hematopoietic progenitors and stem cell populations in normal human bone marrow. Flotetuzumab was designed to redirect T lymphocytes to kill CD123-expressing cells. To achieve this, the DART molecule combines an arm that recognizes CD123 on the target cancer cells, with a portion of an antibody recognizing CD3, an activating protein expressed by normal T cells, which are specialized white blood cells in the human immune system.
In December 2018, we presented data from our Phase 1 dose expansion study of flotetuzumab in relapsed/refractory patients with AML. In this study, we enrolled 31 patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 500 ng/kg/day by continuous infusion with a lead-in dosing strategy. The goal of the expansion cohort study was to evaluate the safety and preliminary anti-leukemic activity of flotetuzumab, optimize delivery and supportive care, including the management of cytokine release syndrome, and to define the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of flotetuzumab. In the study, flotetuzumab demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. In 27 response evaluable patients, the ORR was 26% (7 of 27 patients), with a composite complete response rate (combining both complete responses (CRs) and complete responses with incomplete hematological improvement (CRi)) of 19% (5 of 27 patients). Notably, in primary refractory patients, an extremely challenging population to treat, the ORR was 35% (6 of 17 patients) with a CR/CRi rate of 29% (5 out of 17 patients). The median duration of response for the patients that experienced a CR (three patients), a CRi (two patients) and a morpohologic leukemia-free state (one patient) was 3.1 months. The most common treatment-related adverse event was infusion-related reaction/cytokine release syndrome, which occurred in 93% (29 of 31) of patients. Grade 3 or greater infusion-related reaction/cytokine release syndrome was observed in 13% (4 of 31) of patients. We plan to enroll additional patients in this ongoing study and announce data in 2019. We also intend to study flotetuzumab in combination with MGA012 in a future clinical trial.  
The FDA granted orphan drug designation to flotetuzumab for the treatment of AML. Our collaborator, Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Servier (collectively, Servier) has development and commercialization rights outside North America, Japan, Korea and India for flotetuzumab (S80880).
Other DART Molecules
MGD007. An additional CD3-targeting DART molecule, MGD007, recognizes glycoprotein A33 (gpA33), which is expressed on gastrointestinal tumors, including more than 95% of human colon cancers, and CD3 and is being tested in patients with colorectal cancer in a Phase 1 clinical study in combination with MGA012. In late 2018, our collaborator, Servier, notified us that it declined to exercise its option to gain development and commercialization rights for MGD007 in its territories. 
MGD014. MGD014 is a DART molecule that targets the envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected cells (Env) and T cells, via their CD3 component, to redirect the immune system's T cells to kill HIV-infected cells. DART molecules could be used independently or become a key part of a "shock-and-kill" strategy in conjunction with HIV latency-reversing agents currently under development. MGD014 is our first clinical DART molecule designed to target virus-infected cells. A Phase 1 dose escalation study of MGD014 is ongoing. We are developing MGD014 under contract number
 HHSN272201500032C awarded to us in September 2015 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.
Our DART molecules that redirect T cells against cancer or other targets, including MGD007, MGD009, flotetuzumab and MGD014, are manufactured using a conventional antibody platform without the complexity of having to genetically modify T cells from individual patients, as would be required by approaches such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. 
Our Investment in R&D
We continue to invest in our clinical-stage programs, advance additional preclinical product candidates, primarily using our proprietary technology platforms, and expand the potential of our platforms using our antibody and protein engineering expertise. We develop new therapeutic product candidates internally using our proprietary platforms and also in collaboration with other biopharmaceutical companies, when such relationships are advantageous for strategic or financial reasons. These arrangements have allowed us to expand and accelerate the breadth of our product candidates and also have generated a significant portion of the funding we have received to date. We also have our own manufacturing facilities intended to meet later-stage clinical and future potential commercial requirements. 
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a fully integrated biotechnology company leading in the discovery, development and commercialization of breakthrough biologics for the treatment of patients with cancer.
Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
•Oncology focus, science driven. We create therapeutic biological products primarily to treat various types of cancers, including both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Our proprietary DART and Fc Optimization technology platforms are particularly useful for targeting and harnessing specific elements of the human immune system, allowing us to design molecules that (1) directly target cancer cells and enhance the ability of the immune system to destroy those cells, (2) re-direct effector cells to attack tumors or (3) affect mechanisms that regulate the immune response to cancer, either by stimulating pathways that enhance this response or by blocking pathways that inhibit this response, including checkpoint molecules. This field of scientific discovery, broadly known as immuno-oncology, has been developing rapidly in the last few years, and most therapeutic products to date are largely focused on affecting individual biological pathways. We believe that cancers are sufficiently complex that effective treatments must simultaneously affect more than one pathway. We believe that we are well-positioned, particularly through the adaptability of our DART platform, to be able to create and develop therapeutic molecules designed to simultaneously target more than one pathway.
This same flexibility in our platforms allows us to create therapeutic molecules that may be useful for other unmet medical needs beyond cancer, such as for autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. Our core strategic focus is on development of cancer therapeutics, but we may also opportunistically pursue such possibilities when they arise.
•Fully integrated with a deep pipeline. Our objective is to be a fully-integrated biotechnology company, and we intend to continue to grow and establish all necessary functions from early-stage research through commercialization in at least the United States. At our current stage of development as a company, we have established early-stage discovery, process development, clinical development and clinical-stage manufacturing functions, we have completed the build-out of a facility that will support commercial manufacturing, and we intend to build a U.S.-based sales and marketing infrastructure as our development pipeline matures.
We have a broad portfolio of product candidates and we are not dependent upon the success of any one of them for the overall success of the company. We continue to augment our pipeline through the discovery and development of new product candidates, primarily through utilization of our internal scientific expertise and strategically seeking external collaborations that can augment our own skills. In 2018, we advanced three programs into clinical development. Our goal is to continue to advance one or more programs into clinical development per year to ensure a robust pipeline and to replace product candidates that fail to progress.
•Leveraging collaborations. Throughout our company's history, we have entered into collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies and intend to continue to do so. We enter into collaborations when there is a strategic advantage to us to do so and when we believe the financial terms of the collaboration are favorable for meeting our short-term and long-term strategic objectives. We are not dependent upon any one of these collaborations, but in many cases we have rights to receive sales royalties and other significant financial payments if the partnered product candidates achieve certain development and sales milestones. We endeavor to establish collaborations that preserve our right to participate in future commercialization, for example by securing co-promotion or profit-sharing rights under certain circumstances.
•Investments in talent and culture.  One of our most valuable assets is the quality of our employee base. We invest significant effort in selecting and retaining high caliber, talented individuals who reflect our values. As we continue to grow, we continue to seek and develop employees who are strongly committed to delivering life-changing medicines for unmet medical needs through a collaborative work environment.
Our Therapeutic Area Focus: Cancer
Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which cells divide and grow in an uncontrolled manner, forming malignancies that can invade other parts of the body. In normal tissues, the rates of new cell growth and cell death are tightly regulated and kept in balance. In cancerous tissues, this balance is disrupted as a result of mutations, causing unregulated cell growth that leads to tumor formation and growth. While tumors can grow slowly or rapidly, the dividing cells will nevertheless accumulate, and the normal organization of the tissue will become disrupted. Cancers subsequently can spread throughout the body by processes known as invasion and metastasis. Once cancer spreads to sites beyond the primary tumor, it generally becomes more difficult to treat and may be incurable. Cancer cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow are referred to as hematological malignancies. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors. Cancer can arise in virtually any part of the body, with the most common types arising in the prostate gland, breast, lung, colon and skin. We believe that our platforms position us very well strategically to actively develop approaches for the treatment of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. An increasing number of people are also living longer with cancer. The American Cancer Society has estimated that by January 2026, the population of cancer survivors in the United States will increase to almost 20.3 million people. 
Our Platforms and Technology Expertise
We apply our understanding of disease biology, immune-mediated mechanisms and next generation antibody technologies to design specifically targeted antibody-based product candidates based on our DART and Fc Optimization platforms. Through these platforms we have designed antibody-based product candidates that have the potential to improve on standard treatments by having one or more of the following attributes: (1) multiple specificities; (2) increased abilities to interact with the body's immune system to fight tumors; (3) capacity to bind more avidly to antigen targets: (4) increased potency; (5) reduced immunogenicity or (6) the ability to target cancer cells that are resistant to standard treatments. Moreover, these technology platforms are complementary and can be combined.
DART and TRIDENT Platforms: Our Proprietary Approach to Engineer Multi-Specific Antibodies
We use our DART platform to create derivatives of antibodies with the ability to bind to two distinct targets instead of a single one found in traditional monoclonal antibodies. DART product candidates are therefore bispecific. An example of a bispecific molecule is illustrated below:
Because cancer cells have developed ways to escape the immune system, we have created DART molecules, which are alternative antibody-like structures with more potent immune properties than the parent antibody molecules from which they are derived. The two variable regions of an antibody are mono-specific and are able to target only a single type structural component of an antigen. For many years, researchers have sought to create recombinant molecules that are capable of targeting two antigens or epitopes (i.e., specific part of an antigen bound by the antibody) within the same molecule. The challenges in creating such molecules have been the instability of the resulting bispecific molecules and their inherently short half-lives, as well as the inefficiencies in manufacturing these compounds. We believe our DART platform has overcome these engineering challenges by incorporating proprietary covalent di-sulfide linkages and particular amino acid sequences that efficiently pair the chains of the DART molecule. This is designed to provide a structure with enhanced manufacturability, long-term structural
 stability and the ability to tailor the half-lives of the DART molecules to their clinical needs. This engineered antibody-like protein has a compact and stable structure and enables the targeting of two different antigens with a single recombinant molecule.
The DART platform has been specifically engineered to accommodate virtually any variable region sequence with predictable expression, folding and antigen recognition. We believe our multi-specific platforms may provide a significant advantage over current biological interventions in cancer, autoimmune disorders and infectious disease by enabling a range of modalities, including those described below.
We have also advanced beyond our DART platform to establish a TRIDENT platform, which reflects the continuing evolution of our multi-specific antibody-based targeting expertise. Built on the DART module, the trivalent TRIDENT platform incorporates in an Ig-like format an additional domain capable of engaging an independent antigen. With the inclusion of a third targeting arm, TRIDENT molecules enable a broader range of mechanisms of action than bispecific targeting, allowing, for instance, the engagement of multiple antigens on a single or on different cells or enabling enhanced target selectivity by modulating the avidity of one of two antigens.
Our DART and TRIDENT platforms enable us to design multi-specific molecules that seek to exploit different mechanisms of action, including those set forth below.

• Redirected T cell activation and killing. In this version of the DART molecule, we are enabling the cancer-fighting properties of the immune effector cells, such as T lymphocytes to: (1) recognize and bind to structures expressed on a cancer cell (e.g., CD123, the first specificity in the example on the right), (2) enable the recruitment of all types of cytotoxic, or cell killing, T cells, irrespective of their ability to recognize cancer cells (e.g., CD3, a common component of the T cell antigen receptor, is the second specificity in the example on the right) and (3) trigger T cell activation, expansion, and cell killing mechanisms to destroy a cancer cell. The outcome is that any of the body's T cells, in theory, could be recruited to destroy a cancer cell and thus, are not limited to the small numbers of specific T cells that might have been generated in response to cancer to kill tumor cells. Furthermore, since any T cell could be recruited for this killing process, only small amounts of a DART molecule are required to trigger this potent immune response. Additionally, the compact structure of the DART protein makes it well suited for maintaining cell-to-cell contact, which we believe contributes to the high level of target cell killing. Similarly, DART molecules targeting CD3 and a viral antigen can be used to recruit T cells to eliminate cells infected by a virus, such as HIV-infected cells. 
• Targeting of multiple co-inhibitory receptors or checkpoints, such as those involved in inhibiting T cell responses. The immune system generally prevents the development of autoimmune phenomena by regulating activated immune cells that have responded to non-self or foreign antigens. This negative feedback loop is triggered by the interactions of co-inhibitory receptors, or checkpoint molecules, expressed on the immune cells with ligands expressed by other cells, such as antigen-presenting cells. This phenomenon is exploited by cancer, whereby tumor cells express checkpoint ligands that block the development of an immune response against the tumor. Antibodies that block the interaction of checkpoint molecules with their ligands have been shown to significantly improve the clinical outcomes of patients with certain advanced cancers. Because of the diversity of immune checkpoint pathways, blockade of a single axis, while clinically significant, as shown in the case of the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with pembrolizumab or nivolumab, will not benefit all patients. In fact, combinations of checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 blocker, have resulted in significantly enhanced benefit compared to ipilimumab or nivolumab alone. We believe that DART molecules targeting two immunoregulatory pathways, such as two checkpoints in a single molecule, could afford the clinical benefit of the combination together with the potential for synergistic activity, as well as significant advantages in manufacturing, simplified clinical development, and enhanced patient convenience. 
• Enhanced effector cell selectivity. T lymphocytes with lytic effector function belong preferentially to the CD8 lineage, while CD4-positive T cells preferentially provide immune regulatory function, such as the secretion of cytokines or the differentiation into regulatory T cells. Greater selectivity in the recruitment of effector T cells is an example of the range of applications of our TRIDENT technology. By encoding a CD8 recognition arm in addition to the CD3- and tumor antigen-specific arms, our TRIDENT technology allows the preferential engagement of CD8-positive T lymphocytes and redirects them against tumor cells. This strategy allows for retention of lytic effector function, while limiting the CD4 cell engagement and associated effects, such as inflammatory cytokine release. 

In addition to the ability to tailor a DART molecule's valency, we have the capacity to modify the strength by which the binding sites attach to their targets and the molecule's half-life in the blood circulation after delivery to a patient. Furthermore, when an Fc domain is coupled with a DART molecule, additional changes can be included that can modulate the DART molecule's engagement with different immune cells.
We are developing specific product candidates using this technology, including flotetuzumab, MGD009, MGD007, MGD013, MGD019 and MGD014, among others. 
Fc Optimization Platform: Our Proprietary Approach to Enhance Immune-Mediated Cancer Cell Killing
To enhance the body's immune ability, we developed our Fc Optimization platform which introduces certain mutations into the Fc region of an antibody and is able to modulate antibody interaction with immune effector cells. Such interaction enhances the body's immune ability to mediate the killing of cancer cells through ADCC.

The Fc region mediates the function of IgG antibodies by binding to different activating and inhibitory receptors, referred to as FcγRs, on immune effector cells found within the innate immune system. By engineering Fc regions to bind with an increased affinity to the activating FcγRs and with a reduced affinity to the inhibitory FcγRs, we have been able to impart a more effective immune response and improve effector functions, such as ADCC. This is another example in which small changes in antibody structure can confer improvements on normal immune processes.
We have established a proprietary platform to engineer, screen, identify and test antibodies' Fc regions with customizable activity. In particular, we have licenses to use transgenic mice that express human FcγRs. These mice can be used for in vivo testing of antibodies that incorporate Fc domain variants, including those antibodies intended for cancer therapy.
To date, we have successfully incorporated our Fc variants in two of our clinical-stage antibody product candidates, margetuximab and enoblituzumab. We have preclinical data demonstrating that these Fc variants have substantially improved the activity of these antibodies. In addition, clinical data from our Phase 3 SOPHIA study of margetuximab demonstrated an improvement in activity over that of trastuzumab, an analog monoclonal antibody with a wild-type, non-engineered Fc domain.
Our Collaborations
We pursue a balanced approach between product candidates that we develop ourselves and those that we develop with our collaborators. Under our strategic collaborations to date, we have received significant non-dilutive funding and continue to have rights to additional funding upon completion of certain research, achievement of key product development milestones and royalties and other payments upon the commercial sale of products. Each of our collaborations has a unique set of terms and conditions.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to protect, for example, the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, the technology platforms used to generate them, related technologies and/or other aspects of the inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business. In addition, there is cost and risk to our business in defending and enforcing our patents, maintaining our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties and preserving the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operating without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary positions. We currently use multiple industry-standard patent monitoring systems to monitor new United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) filings for any applications by third parties that may infringe on our patents.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the
 patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
A third party may hold patents or other intellectual property rights that are important to or necessary for the development of our product candidates or use of our technology platforms. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. For example, certain patents held by third parties cover Fc engineering methods and mutations in Fc regions to enhance the binding of Fc regions to Fc receptors on immune cells. Although we believe that these patents are not infringed, invalid, and unenforceable, should a court find that they cover margetuximab or enoblituzumab and we are unable to invalidate them, or if licenses for them are not available on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, perhaps materially.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions can be maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention. In the ordinary course of business we participate in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge the patentability of third party patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
Pipeline Patent Protection
As of December 31, 2018, we held 79 patents in the United States with 50 patent applications pending and 428 patents in other countries of the world with 687 patent applications pending. In addition to patents and patent applications generally providing protection for various aspects of our Fc Optimization, DART, and TRIDENT platforms, we have patent and patent applications for the composition of matter of each of our clinical pipeline product candidates and, in some cases, we also have other patents and patent application related to various aspects of the technology underlying these product candidates or their methods of use.
Patent terms may be adjusted or extended, as described in greater detail below, in certain circumstances. However, assuming no adjustments or extensions, the primary composition of matter patent for each of our clinical pipeline product candidates is expected to expire in the following timeframes:

Product Candidate | Expiration Date
margetuximab | 2029 
enoblituzumab | 2031

Patent Term Extension and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs, including biological products, of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the ACA) created a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars via an abbreviated licensure pathway. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. Under the ACA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is "biosimilar to" or "interchangeable with" a previously approved biological product or "reference product." The "biosimilar" application must include specific information demonstrating biosimilarity based on data derived from: (1) analytical studies, (2) animal studies, and (3) a clinical study or studies that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, except that FDA may waive some of these requirements for a given application. Under this new statutory scheme, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years after the date of first licensure. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biological products. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. There have been recent proposals to repeal or modify the ACA and it is uncertain how any of those proposals, if approved, would affect these provisions.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions.
In-Licensed Intellectual Property
We have entered into patent and know-how license agreements that grant us the rights to use certain technologies related to biological manufacturing for our clinical product candidates. We anticipate using these technologies for future product candidates. These licensors have businesses dedicated to licensing this type of technology and we anticipate that licenses to use these technologies for our future products will be available. The licenses typically include yearly maintenance payments and sales royalties, and may also include upfront payments or milestone payments.
Manufacturing
We currently manufacture our drug substance for our clinical trials at our manufacturing facilities located in Rockville, Maryland. For our antibody product candidates, we have supplemented our drug substance manufacturing capacity through an arrangement with AGC Biologics, Inc. (AGC, formerly CMC Biologics, Inc.), a contract manufacturing organization, and plan to commercially produce margetuximab at AGC assuming approval of margetuximab. We have also completed the build-out of a manufacturing suite at our headquarters building in Rockville, Maryland, which has been designed to increase our internal capacity to manufacture more drug substance lots, at larger scale and in full compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) to be able to sell commercial product, when and if approved by the FDA . In addition, we currently rely on and will continue to rely on contract fill-finish service providers, primarily Ajinomoto Althea, Inc. and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, to fulfill our fill-finish needs for our current and future product candidates.
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, we obtain certain raw materials principally from only one source. In the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product, we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented. However, in the event of an extended failure of a supplier, it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or, in some cases, implemented alternative processes.
Production processes for biological therapeutic products are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, if we were to experience extended plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities, extended failure of a contract supplier or contract manufacturing organization, or extraordinary unplanned increases in demand, we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded.
Commercialization
We cannot market or promote a new product until a marketing application has been approved by the FDA. We currently have no approved products in the United States. We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure. We believe that it will be possible for us to access the United States oncology market through a specialty sales force. Subject to receiving marketing authorization in the United States, we expect to commence commercialization via our then-in-place sales and marketing organizations. We believe that these organizations will be able to serve the oncology community in treating the patient populations for which our oncology product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into arrangements with third-party commercial partners for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
Competition
There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer and autoimmune disorders, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These treatments consist both of small molecule drug products, as well as biologic therapeutics that work by using next-generation antibody technology platforms to address specific cancer targets. In particular, margetuximab is directed against HER2 and several companies have cancer therapeutics directed against HER2 marketed or in development, such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), particularly through its affiliate, Genentech, Inc., as well as Puma Biotechnology, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, Seattle Genetics Inc. and Synthon Biopharmaceuticals. Market competition may limit the utilization of margetuximab as a therapeutic, even if market approval and adequate reimbursement is obtained, and competition among development-stage programs for patients enrolling in clinical trials for HER2-directed therapies may delay expected timelines for our clinical trials. 
In addition, the immuno-oncology field is competitive, with treatments currently approved and on the market or in development for various tumor types and patient populations from a variety of different companies such as Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), and Roche, all of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Many of our pipeline programs, if successful, will likely face significant competition both by therapeutics that are already being marketed as well as those that will be approved for marketing before our programs. In particular, we are developing a franchise of PD-1-directed product candidates, which includes a monoclonal antibody that we've outlicensed and two DART molecules. Merck, BMS, Roche, AstraZeneca plc, Pfizer Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. all have approved products that target either the PD-1 receptor or its ligand, PD-L1, and there are several other companies that have anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies in clinical development, all of which would compete with our PD-1-directed programs.
Finally, several companies are also developing therapeutics that work by targeting multiple specificities using a single recombinant molecule. Amgen Inc. has obtained marketing approval for one product that works by targeting antigens both on immune effector cell populations and those expressed on certain cancer cells, and has other product candidates in development that use this mechanism. In addition, other companies are developing new treatments for cancer that utilize multi-specific approaches, including Abbvie Inc., Affimed Therapeutics AG Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, Genmab A/S, Merus B.V., Regeneron, Roche, Xencor, Inc. and Zymeworks, Inc.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic or biosimilar competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. In addition, the standard of medical care provided to cancer patients continues to evolve as more scientific and medical information becomes available. These changes in medical care relate to pharmaceutical products, but are also affected by other factors, and such changes can positively or negatively affect the prospects of our product candidates as well as those of our competitors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop, or the standards of care for cancer patients change while our clinical trials are ongoing. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar products. Biosimilar products are expected to become available over the coming years. For example, a trastuzumab biosimilar has been approved in the U.S. by FDA.
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third party payors. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, to the extent an approved drug is ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with the approved drug.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Regulation
All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA as biological products  (biologics). The FDA subjects biologics to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biologics. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal penalties.
Preclinical Studies. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky; failure rates are high. Product development cycles are long - approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new biological product must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish it is pure, potent and safe.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, pharmacology, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including FDA's good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to begin human testing. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND application. Certain preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue even after the IND application is submitted. An IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold or agrees on an alternate approach with us. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND application may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Development. Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to human subjects (healthy volunteers or patients) under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with all applicable federal regulations and guidance, including those pertaining to good clinical practice (GCP) standards that are meant to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; as well as (ii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing of a new drug in the United States (whether in patients or healthy volunteers) must be included in the IND application submission, and FDA must be notified of subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the protocol must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB) and all study subjects must provide informed consent prior to participating in the study. Typically, each institution participating in the clinical trial will require review of the protocol before any clinical trial commences at that
 institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and there are additional, more frequent reporting requirements for suspected unexpected serious adverse events.
A study sponsor might choose to discontinue a clinical trial or a clinical development program for a variety of reasons. The FDA may impose a temporary or permanent clinical hold, or other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three pre-approval phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined, particularly in testing for oncology indications. In Phase 1, testing is conducted in a small group of subjects who may be patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers, to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. In Phase 2, the drug is given to a larger group of subjects with the target condition to further evaluate its safety and gather preliminary evidence of efficacy. Phase 3 studies typically last multiple years for oncology indications. In Phase 3, the drug is given to a large group of subjects with the target disease or condition (several hundred to several thousand), often at multiple geographical sites, to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, and collect data to support drug approval. In some cases, FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases and obtain marketing approval.
Product Approval. After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA can be prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and annual product and establishment user fees also apply. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review, and the review period under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act begins. The standard for reviewing a BLA is whether the product is safe, pure and potent, which has been interpreted to include that the product is safe and effective and has a favorable benefit-risk profile. FDA's current performance goals call for FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) BLAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority BLAs, which is 12 months and eight months, respectively, if the 60-day review of the initial application is included in the timeline. In addition, the FDA has developed approaches intended to make certain qualifying products available to patients rapidly - Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Fast Track. While the timelines for approval under these pathways may be shorter, there are requirements and conditions associated with each pathway, and there can be no assurance that any of our investigational products will be able to meet the conditions or requirements necessary to receive any such designation or be able to receive the review or approval benefits associated with such designations. 
The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes outside clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether sufficient data exist in the application to support product approval. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory. FDA also reviews the proposed labeling submitted with the BLA and typically requires changes in the labeling text.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing and testing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. Complete response letters generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and delineate the additional testing or information needed in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two or six months from receipt depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the approved indication or indications and the other conditions of use set out in the approved prescribing information. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions that can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. As a condition of approval, or after approval, the FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS may include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
Other U.S. Post-Marketing Regulatory Requirements. Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including those relating to advertising, promotion, adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, and cGMPs, as well as registration, listing, and inspection. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
FDA regulates the content and format of prescription drug labeling, advertising, and promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional Internet communications. FDA also establishes parameters for permissible non-promotional communications between industry and the medical community, including industry-supported scientific and educational activities. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion for uses not consistent with the approved labeling, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses or otherwise not to have met applicable promotion rules may be subject to significant liability under both the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act. See "Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements" below for more information.
All aspects of pharmaceutical manufacture must conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the FDA inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, product formulation or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, in some cases before the change may be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
Manufacturers are subject to requirements for adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports following FDA approval of a BLA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or failure of Phase 4 studies to meet their specified endpoints, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, the need to conduct additional post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, or recall of the product and withdrawal of the BLA.
Noncompliance with postmarket requirements can result in one or more of the following consequences:
•Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•Warning letters;
•Holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•Refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Approval of Biosimilars. The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. The law establishes a period of 12 years of exclusivity for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation, and outlines statutory criteria for science-based biosimilar approval standards that take into account patient safety considerations. Under this framework, exclusivity protects innovator products by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from being granted FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the innovator's data in their application to the FDA. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biological products. There are regular legislative proposals to rescind or reduce the biologics exclusivity provisions of the ACA and it is uncertain whether or if any of those proposals may be approved, and if approved, how exclusivity for biologics would be affected. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
For example, certain financial interactions with healthcare professionals may be subject to the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act and the False Claims Act, and in addition our activities may be affected by the privacy regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, and similar state laws.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our collaborators, may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, drug registration, commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates outside the United States. These regulations can vary between jurisdictions and can be more onerous than regulations in the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union (EU) before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (CTA) much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, and other applicable regulatory requirements. A separate CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to be conducted.
In the EU, for example, to obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product, we must submit a marketing authorisation application (MAA). The content of the MAA is similar to that of a New Drug Application or BLA filed in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, EU-specific document requirements. Under the EU regulatory system, a company may submit marketing authorisation applications either under a centralised or decentralised procedure. Under the centralised procedure in the EU, a MAA is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The maximum timeframe for a CHMP evaluation of an MAA that has been validated is 210 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions. A favorable opinion on the application by the CHMP will typically result in the granting of the marketing authorisation by the European Commission within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. Generally, the entire review process takes approximately 13-14 months. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions.
As in the United States, we or our collaborators may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the MAA is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy certain benefits, including up to 10 years of exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. The PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) initiative was established by the EMA to help promote and foster the development of new medicines in the EU that demonstrate potential for a major therapeutic advantage in areas of unmet medical need. Benefits from the PRIME designation include early confirmation of potential for accelerated assessment, early dialogue and increased interaction with relevant regulatory committees to discuss development options, scientific advice at key development milestones, and proactive regulatory support from the EMA.
  If we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
In the United States and other countries, sales of any future products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Third-party reimbursement adequate to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development may not be available for our products.
Drug prices have become a subject of increased focus in recent years. Although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the U.S., federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain Medicaid-reimbursed drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under certain public healthcare programs such as Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Various states have adopted further mechanisms that seek to control drug prices, including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs or by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers. Managed care has also become a potent force in the market place that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products.
Public and private healthcare payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered.
Facilities
Our headquarters building, located in Rockville, Maryland, currently houses laboratory and office space and we recently completed the build-out of a suite for manufacturing at commercial quantities and scale. This space is occupied under a lease that expires in 2027 and may be extended for up to two additional seven-year terms. We also have a smaller-scale manufacturing facility in Rockville. The lease for a portion of that facility expires in March 2023 and may be extended for a five-year term, and the lease for the remainder of that facility expires in December 2019 and may be extended for up to two additional five-year terms. Finally, we have additional laboratory and office space in Rockville under two leases that each expire in 2020, and each of those leases may be extended for a five-year term. 
We also lease office and laboratory space in Brisbane, California under a lease that expires in November 2023.
Employees
As of February 22, 2019, we had 364 full-time employees, 307 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 61 of whom had an M.D. or Ph.D. degree.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time we may be involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
