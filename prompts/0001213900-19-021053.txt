ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
Aura Systems, Inc., is a Delaware corporation that was founded in 1987. The Company designs, assembles, tests and sells our proprietary and patented axial flux induction machine known as the AuraGen® for industrial and commercial applications and the VIPER for military applications (collectively referred to as the “AuraGen”).
 
Our patented AuraGen® system –– when applied as a generator –– uses an existing engine (of a vehicle or any other prime mover) to create mechanical energy which is then converted into electric power by our system. Our control system is used to deliver such power to the user. When used as an electric motor, our system delivers mechanical power to drive mechanical devices. During the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company significantly reduced operations due to lack of financial resources. During the second half of fiscal 2016, the Company’s operations were further disrupted when the Company was forced to move from its facilities in Redondo Beach, California to a smaller facility in Stanton, California. During fiscal 2017, the Company curtailed much of its engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations. During fiscal 2018, the Company successfully restructured in excess of $30 million of debt and held its first stockholder meeting since 2011. During fiscal 2019, the Company continued to focus on seeking new sources of financing and utilized a contract manufacturer to produce some initial products. Since July 2019, the Company has focused its efforts on the sales and manufacturing of its products as well as rebuilding relationships with its vendors and suppliers. Though these efforts, since July 1, 2019, the Company has shipping more than fifty units and has built a backlog of approximately $450,000.
 
Traditional induction machines represent a radial flux design and are the workhorse of industry due to their robustness, attractive cost, and easy control. However, radial flux machines are also relatively heavy and bulky. Axial flux induction machines (such as the AuraGen®), on the other hand, have all of the advantages of radial flux machines, but with the advantage of higher energy density. This results in axial flux machines being smaller and lighter yet with equivalent performance. Unlike permanent magnet (“PM”) machines, induction machines do not use any permanent magnets and therefore the controller can change the magnetic (B) fields since generally the magnetic (B) field is proportionate to the voltage divided by the frequency (V/f). It is generally accepted that for PM machines, as machine size grows, the magnetic losses increase proportionately, and partial load efficiency drops. On the other hand, with induction machines, as the machine size grows, magnetic losses do not necessarily grow. Induction drives could offer an advantage when high-performance is desired. The peak efficiency of an induction drive will be somewhat lower than with PM machines, but average efficiency may actually increase.
 
The history of electric motors reveals that the earliest machines were in fact axial flux machines. However, after the first radial flux machines were demonstrated in the early 1900’s, such machines were accepted as mainstream configuration. The reason for shelving the axial flux machines were multifold and can be summarized as follows: (i) strong axial magnetic attraction force between the stator and the rotor, (ii) fabrication difficulties such as cutting the slots in laminated cores, (iii) high cost involved in manufacturing the laminated stator core, (iv) difficulties in assembling the machine and maintaining a uniform air gap and (v) providing a laminated rotor that can stand the large centrifugal forces. Technological developments by Aura show that all of the historical objections for axial flux machines can be addressed with developments in the design of such machines, as well as, the design of the proper manufacturing processes and tooling.

The issue of the strong axial magnetic attraction force between the stator and the rotor was addressed by Aura’s patented approach of using a topology of two stators and a rotor sandwiched between them. This has been disclosed in Aura’s U.S. Patent 5,734,217 (March 1998), which expired in March 2018, and U.S. Patent 6,157,175 (Dec. 2000). In addition to other benefits, the topology is such that the axial forces on the bearings are very small and negligible.
 
The Company has also developed a cast rotor for the axial flux machine as described in U.S. Patents 5,734,217 and 6,157,175. This rotor does not require any laminates and provides the structural integrity to withstand very large centrifugal forces, while at the same time provides the proper electric and magnetic properties.
 
The AuraGen® system is composed of three primary subsystems (i) the patented axial flux alternator, (ii) the electronic control unit (“ECU”) and (iii) mounting kit that is a mechanical interface between the alternator and the prime mover. The architecture of our ECU is designed to separate the power generation from the power user, thus creating a flexible system that can support multi voltages simultaneously. The system architecture is based on having a direct current (“DC”) power bus that is used to excite the alternator and also to collect energy from the alternator. The user loads are supported from the power bus and not directly from the alternator. This immediately leads to a load following design where the demand on the alternator at any moment in time is equal to the demanded user load (up to the maximum alternator power capabilities). In addition, the output power is constructed from the power bus with either a PWM based inverter for alternating current (“AC”) output, and/or, a unique patented bi-direction power supply (“BDPS”) that acts as a DC to DC converter to provide different DC voltages as an output. The BDPS provides the capability of adding power to the bus from a DC source such as batteries whenever sudden spikes or demands occur. The BDPS also provides the seamless transition to maintain the power bus when the prime mover is turned off (batteries are used to support the power bus).
 
After a lengthy development period, the Company began commercializing the AuraGen® in late 1999 and early 2000. Our first commercial product was a 5,000-watt 120/240V AC machine, in 2001; we subsequently added an 8,000-watt configuration and also introduced the BDPS that allowed us to provide simultaneously an AC/DC solution. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced a system that generates up to 16,000-watts of continuous power by combining two 8,000 watts’ systems (dual system). Today, the Company’s primary product line consists of 5,000-watt, 10,000-watt and 20,000-watt systems, each of which is offered in AC, AC/DC and BDPS configurations.
 
Starting in 2017, the Company began reexamining its strategic approach to the market and has identified key areas upon which to initially focus as the Company restarts operations. The markets available for AuraGen® products are both vertical and horizontal in nature and cover numerous industries and applications worldwide. As such, the Company has developed a strategy focused on existing markets for the AuraGen® products as well as the formation of international joint ventures and other strategic partnerships to address local markets and needs. The first such joint venture, Jiangsu Shengfeng Mobile Power Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu Shengfeng”), was entered into during 2017 to address the Chinese market. Under the Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture agreement, Aura owns 49% of the venture and our Chinese partner owns 51%. The Chinese partner is to contribute a total of approximately $9.25 million to the venture –– principally in the form of facilities and equipment as wells as approximately $500,000 in cash. The Company contributed $250,000 in cash as well as a limited license to the joint venture to manufacture, sell and service the AuraGen® products within China. The limited license sold to the Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture, however, does not permit Jiangsu Shengfeng to manufacture the AuraGen® rotor; rather, the joint venture is required to purchase all rotor subassemblies as well as certain software elements directly from the Company. Jiangsu Shengfeng’s board of directors consists of three members appointed by the Company and three appointed by our Chinese partner; Jiangsu Shengfeng’s CEO is appointed by our Chinese partner while its CFO and director for quality assurance and control are appointed by Aura.

Business Arrangements
 
During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, the Company’s engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities were reduced while we focused on renegotiating numerous financial obligations. During this time, the Company’s agreements with numerous customers, third party vendors, and organizations and entities material to the operation of the Company business were canceled, delayed or terminated. During fiscal 2018, the Company successfully restructured in excess of $30 million of debt. During fiscal 2019, the Company continued to address its financial needs and began utilizing an outside contractor to manufacture the AuraGen® product. Utilizing contractors, the Company shipped 13 units to customers during fiscal 2019. In July 2019, the Company began significantly increasing its engineering, manufacturing and marketing activities. From July 1, 2019 through the date of this filing, we have shipped more than 50 units to customers and have developed a backlog of orders for more than 70 units. For additional information regarding current orders held by the Company, see Item 1 “Backlog” and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.
 
In March 2017, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with a Chinese company to build, service and distribute AuraGen® products in China. Under the Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture agreement, the Chinese partner owns 51% of the joint venture and the Company owns 49%. The Chinese partner contributed a total of approximately $9.75 million to the venture principally in the form of facilities, equipment, and approximately $500,000 of working capital while the Company contributed $250,000 in cash as well as a limited license. The limited license sold to the joint venture, however, does not permit the venture to manufacture the AuraGen® rotor; rather, the joint venture is required to purchase all rotor subassemblies as well as certain software elements directly from the Company.
 
On March 26, 2019, various stockholders of the Company, controlling a combined total of more than 27.5 million shares, delivered a signed written consent to the Company removing Ronald Buschur as a member of the Company’s Board and electing Cipora Lavut as a director of the Company.  On March 27, 2019, those same stockholders delivered a further signed written consent to the Company removing William Anderson and Si Ryong Yu as members of the Company’s Board and electing Robert Lempert and David Mann as directors of the Company. These written consents represented a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of March 26, 2019 and March 27, 2019, respectively. Because of Aura’s refusal to recognize the legal effectiveness of the consents, on April 8, 2019 the stockholders filed suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to Section 225 of the Delaware General Corporations Law, seeking an order confirming the validity of the consents and declaring that Aura’s Board consists of Ms. Lavut, Mr. Mann, Mr. Lempert, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Diaz-Versón, Jr. On July 8, 2019 the Court of Chancery entered final judgment in favor of the stockholder plaintiffs, confirming that (a) Ronald Buschur, Si Ryong Yu and William Anderson had been validly removed by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock acting by written consent (b) Ms. Lavut, Mr. Mann and Mr. Lempert had been validly elected by the holders of a majority of the Company’s outstanding stock acting by written consent, and (c) the Company’s Board of Directors validly consists of Cipora Lavut, David Mann, Robert Lempert, Gary Douglas and Salvador Diaz-Versón, Jr. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for more information.
 
The AuraGen®/VIPER
 
The AuraGen® is composed of three basic subsystems. The first subsystem is the axial flux induction generator that is bolted to, and driven by, the vehicle’s engine, PTO, or any other prime mover. The second subsystem is the ECU, which filters and conditions the electricity to provide clean, steady voltages for both AC and DC power, and provides for variable speed applications as well as load following for increased efficiency. The third subsystem consists of mounting brackets and supporting components for installation and integration of the generator with the vehicle engine, PTO, or the prime mover.
 
The Company has power solutions for three continuous power levels: (a) 5,000 watts; (b) 10,000 watts; (c) 20,000 watts via a single system.  All the AC power is pure sine wave with total harmonic distortion of less than 2.1% and is available in 120 VAC and/or 230/240 VAC as well as 50/60 Hz and either single or three phases. In addition, the power generated on all models can be partitioned to provide simultaneous AC and 14 or 28 VDC.  The AuraGen® power levels can be generated as the prime mover speed varies from idle to maximum rated speed. The VIPER (the military version of the AuraGen® system) includes as an option a complete power management system which (i) monitors in real time the batteries’ voltage and temperature, (ii) provides a partition of the power between AC and DC simultaneously with the ability to be programmed from all AC to all DC, (iii) monitors the RPM of the generator, (iv) monitors the temperatures of the generator and the ECU, (v) monitors the raw power generated, (vi) monitors both the AC and DC loads as to voltage and current, (vii) provides programming of load prioritization and load shedding, and (viii) monitors the voltage of the internal 400-800 VDC bus.

Mobile and Remote (not power grid connected) Power Industry
 
We believe that the mobile and remote power generation market is large and growing. There are four basic market segments (i) military, (ii) stationary but remote commercial/industrial, (iii) mobile commercial/industrial, and (iv) hybrid, electric and autonomous vehicles. The military market place is also divided between mobile and stationary applications.
 
We believe that one of the fastest growing segments in the military market place is On-Board-Exportable-Power (OBEP), which is electric power on vehicles that can be used to support other than vehicle functions. The driver for the increased demand for on board power are numerous advance weapon systems as well as increase in C4I functions (command, control, communication, computers and information). Currently, most on board power is provided by Auxiliary Power Units (“APUs”) that are (i) large fuel users, (ii) bulky, (iii) heavy and (iv) require constant maintenance. Militaries all over the world are seeking more efficient integrated power solutions for their vehicles.
 
Similar to the military demands, the commercial and industrial markets also require on board power to support modern computers, digital sensors and instruments as well as electrical driven tools. Current automotive alternators cannot supply the existing demanded power and thus the common solution is the use of APUs. These APUs can be environmentally unfriendly, substantial users of fuel, heavy, bulky and require constant maintenance and scheduled service. Vehicles used in the telecommunications, utilities, public works, construction, catering, oil and gas industries, emergency/rescue, and recreational vehicles rely heavily on mobile power for their daily work. Hybrid and electric vehicles by their nature require significant amounts of on-board power to charge batteries as well as to operate electric motors.
 
The traditional available solutions for mobile and remote power users are:
 

● | Gensets (AKA APUs), Gensets are standalone power generation units that are not incorporated into a vehicle and require external fuel, either gasoline or diesel, in order to generate electricity. Gensets (i) are generally noisy and cumbersome to transport because of their weight and size, (ii) typically run at constant speed to generate 50 or 60 Hz of AC power, (iii) must be operated at a significant part of the rated power to avoid wet staking, (iv) are significantly derated in the presence of harmonics in the loads and (v) require significant scheduled maintenance and service. Genset technology has been utilized since the 1950s.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High-Output Alternators, High-output alternators are traditionally found in trucks and commercial vehicles and the vehicle’s engine is used as the prime mover. All high-output alternators provide their rated power at very high RPM and significantly less power at lower RPM. In addition, high-output alternators are generally only 30% efficient at the low RPM range and increase to 50% efficiency at the high end of the RPM range. The power generated by high-output alternators is 12 or 24 Volt DC and an inverter is required if AC power is needed. In addition, due to the low power output at low RPMs, in order to get significant power, a throttle controller is used to speed-up the engine.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inverters, Inverters are devices that invert DC to AC. Inverters as mobile power generators are traditionally used in low power requirements, typically less than 2,500 watts, and do not have the ability to recharge the batteries that are traditionally used as the source of power. Thus, typical inverter users require other means to recharge the used batteries such as “shore-power” or gensets. More recently dynamic inverters became available. Dynamic inverters use power from the alternator to augment power from the batteries and are able to achieve power levels in excess of 6,000 watts. Dynamic inverters introduce significant stresses on both the batteries and alternators, which causes significant life shortening for both. When the inverter is turned on, the alternator is switched off from the vehicle battery and tied into a transformer that uses electronic controls to change the DC alternator inputs to AC inverter output. A separate transformer winding provides battery charging so that fully regulated 120 Volt AC and 12 Volt DC power is available as long as the engine is running at high enough RPM to provide power for the load and the battery charging. All dynamic inverters require a high-output alternator to be able to output significant AC power. As is often the case, the limiting factor is the high-output alternator. In order to get stable output, a very accurate throttle controller is also needed to maintain steady speed on the engine.

● | Permanent-Magnet Alternators. Recently a number of companies have introduced alternators using exotic permanent magnets. These alternators tend to have higher power generation capabilities than regular alternators at lower engine RPM. In order to be practical in an under-the–hood environment (200oF) active cooling must be added, since the magnets are demagnetized at approximately 176oF. There are other issues that require an active control system that will add and subtract magnetic field strength as the engine RPM increases. Over 95% of the magnets used for electric machines comes from China and, beginning in 2011, the price of these magnets has sky-rocketed. In addition, China started limiting export of the magnets in order to have sufficient supplies for local consumption.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fuel Cells. Fuel cells are solid-state devices that produce electricity by combining a fuel containing hydrogen with oxygen. They have a wide range of applications and can be used in place of the internal combustion engine and traditional lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. The most widely deployed fuel cells cost about $2,000 per kilowatt.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Batteries. Batteries convert stored chemical energy to electrical power.

Competition
 
The Company is involved in the application of its AuraGen® technology to mobile power and, as such, faces substantial competition from companies offering different technologies.

Gensets AKA APU- Portable generators meet the large market need for auxiliary power. Millions of units per year are sold in North America alone, and millions more across the world to meet market demands for 1 to 20 Kilowatts of portable power. The market for these power levels addresses the commercial, leisure and residential markets, and divides essentially into: (a) higher power, higher quality and higher price commercial level units; and (b) lower power, lower quality and lower price level units. Gensets provide the strongest competition across the widest marketplace for auxiliary power. Onan, Honda and Kohler, among others, are well established and respected brand names in the genset market for higher reliability auxiliary power generation. There are over 40 registered genset-manufacturing companies in the United States.
High Output Alternators- There are many High Output Alternator manufacturers. Some of the better known are: Delco-Remy, Bosh, Nippon Densu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Prestolite. All alternators provide their rated power at very high RPM and significantly less power at lower RPM. In addition, alternators are generally only 30% efficient at the low RPM range and increase to 50% efficiency at the high RPM range.
Inverters-There are many inverter manufacturers; across the globe the best known one is Xentrex. The pricing of industrial grade sine wave inverters is approximately $700-850 per kilowatt plus the cost of a high output alternator (estimated at $1,000) and a good throttle controller (estimated in the range of $250-500).
 
Permanent-Magnet (“PM”) alternators. -A number of companies have introduced alternators using exotic NdFeB magnets (UQM technologies is one of the better known). These alternators tend to have higher power generation capabilities than regular alternators at lower RPM. Unfortunately, PM machines with NdFeB magnets are very sensitive to temperature and, unlike the AuraGen, cannot survive the typical under-the-hood environment (200oF+). In order to apply such devices for automotive applications one must add expensive and cumbersome active cooling since the magnets are demagnetized at approximately (176oF). To date, such machines have been used mostly in wind-power generation applications.

In addition to the temperature challenges of such machines, there are other issues involving active control of the magnetic field. The main disadvantage of PM generators is the difficulty of output voltage regulation to compensate for speed and load variation due to the lack of a simple means of field control.
 
Fuel Cells-Fuel cells are solid-state, devices that produce electricity by combining a fuel containing hydrogen with oxygen. They have a wide range of applications and can be used in place of the internal combustion engine and traditional lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. These systems are, however, generally prohibitively expensive, and the most widely deployed fuel cells are estimated to cost significantly more per kilowatt than alternative solutions.
Others- Symetron Technology by Raser Inc. is sometimes mistaken for a new form of motor or generator. The Symetron technology is a variable frequency motor/generator controller that uses numerous control schemes to optimize performance. The Symetron technology involves adaptive tuning to continuously optimize motor and system efficiency for the speed and torque operating point.
 
The Symetron controller is a potential competitor to variable speed motor controllers provided by such companies as of ABB, or Baldor-Electric Co.
 
Evans Electric in Australia has introduced an axial flux machine with a complete conductive rotor. Such a machine was first introduced by Brinner more than 20 years ago and was abandoned because the rotor lacked the required rigidity to withstand the magnetic and centrifugal forces. The Brinner machine is cited in Aura’s patents.
 
Transport Refrigeration (“TRU”)- The main competitors for the all-electric TRU are traditional diesel-based solutions provided by Thermo-king and Carrier. The diesel based comparable systems provided by Thermo-king and Carrier are somewhat less expensive than our AuraGen® all-electric solution, however the diesel solutions require frequent maintenance and the utilization of a separate diesel engine that consumes considerable fuel every operating hour. In addition, the diesel solutions emit harmful emissions that have been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California’s Air Resource Board and others as dangerous pollutants and are increasingly subject to federal and state regulations.
 
Most of our competitors have far greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we have. They have larger budgets for research, new product development and marketing, and have long-standing customer relationships. We also compete with many larger and more established companies in the hiring and retention of qualified personnel. Our financial condition has limited our ability to market the AuraGen®.
 
The AuraGen® uses different technology and because our product is radically different from traditionally available mobile power solutions, users may require lengthy evaluation periods to gain confidence in the product. OEMs and large fleet users also typically require considerable time to make changes to their planning and production.
 
Competitive Advantages of the AuraGen®
 
We believe the AuraGen® system to be a superior product due to its convenience, cost efficiency, fuel efficiency, reliability, flexibility in power output, quality of the electricity generated, and its ability to provide the full power at variable speeds as well as provide load following architecture.
 

● | Smaller Size and Weight. The AuraGen’s® patented breakthrough design is more than 50% smaller and lighter as compared to traditional solutions of comparative output. This ultra-compact design allows the AuraGen® to reside “under-the-hood” of most vehicles and to be powered by a vehicle’s primary engine or power takeoff “PTO”. In comparison, traditional solutions are too large and bulky to be integrated directly into most vehicles and, therefore, require their own independent power source.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Higher Efficiency. The AuraGen® power solution is also more efficient than traditional solutions. due to the significant increase in efficiency of the AuraGen® design over conventional designs Traditional alternators, for example, are at best 50% efficient and require approximately 1 gallon of fuel per each 7.6 kW-Hr. The AuraGen® system in comparison is approximately 80% efficient and requires approximately only 1 gallon of fuel per each 12.16 kW-Hr. Thus, given a need for 10 kW of power, for example, the traditional solution will require approximately 1.3 gallons per hour of fuel while the AuraGen® solution will require only 0.83 gallons per hour for the same output.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AuraGen® solution is also a load-following solution that further increases efficiency. A load following solution is able to adjust the amount of power output generated at any one moment to mirror the immediate demand. This is an important characteristic as power demands generally fluctuate (sometimes dramatically). Traditional solutions, in comparison, are not load-following and simply provide power at their maximum output rating at all times, irrespective of demand. By producing only that amount of power necessary to meet actual demand, however, the AuraGen® becomes especially efficient whenever less than maximum power output is required.
 

● | Variable Speed. The AuraGen® solution provides full power at near idol. This means that, unlike most other traditional systems, the AuraGen® system’s ability to provide users with full power is largely independent of the speed of the prime mover. The ability to operate at variable speed makes the Aura solution very attractive when the speed of the prime mover varies and is unpredictable, such as in automotive applications. The variable speed solution is a direct consequence of our system architecture where we separated the power generation from the power delivery by the power bus.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Earth-Forward, Green Technology. The AuraGen® system is significantly more environmentally-friendly than traditional generator and mobile power technology. Because of its extreme efficiency and resulting small size, the AuraGen® system utilizes fewer resources to manufacture. Moreover, the AuraGen® uses a vehicle’s primary automotive engine, which is already highly regulated for environmental protection. Traditional mobile power solutions, in comparison, use small, less efficient, auxiliary engines that produce significantly higher levels of emissions per unit of power output than the automobile engine.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In applications, such as transport refrigeration, use of the AuraGen® system eliminates the need for a separate auxiliary diesel engine to run the refrigeration unit; because these auxiliary diesel engines are highly pollutive as to both emissions and noise, the AuraGen® has the potential to meaningfully impact air and noise pollution levels in areas where it is employed.
 

● | Durability; No Scheduled Maintenance. The AuraGen® is not sensitive to temperature or altitude variations and generates the rated power at or near idle engine RPM. The AuraGen® also does not require scheduled maintenance and is offered with a three-year warranty, compared to the typical one-year warranty available for traditional solutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Targeted Markets
 
The Company has started to reexamine and identify key markets upon which to initially focus as the Company plans to restart operations.
 
(i) One element of our business plan is focused on electric transport refrigeration. The market is well understood and both social and economic forces are providing an unprecedented opportunity to gain significant market share. Our immediate focus is on 20-k BTU/hr. midsize trucks and the 50-k BTU/hr. trailers.
 
(ii) Another element of our business plan is focused on our mobile power solution for military applications around the globe.
 
(iii) We also plan to seek joint venture opportunities similar to the agreement we entered in China to explore other international opportunities.
 
Facilities, Manufacturing Process and Suppliers
 
During fiscal 2019, our facilities consisted of approximately 20,000 square feet in Stanton, California and an additional storage facility in Santa Clarita, California. The Stanton facility is used for some assembly and testing of AuraGen®/VIPER systems and is rented on a month-to-month basis. The rent for the Stanton facility is $10,000 per month and the storage facility is an additional $5,000 per month. Our current Stanton facility is not sufficient to support the expected operations and the Company is planning to look for a new facility to be used for limited production, testing, warehousing and engineering as well as needed office space for support staff. The Company also rents temporary storage space on a month-to-month basis. Commencing in February 2019, the Company began renting approximately 300 square feet of office space in Irvine, California at a cost of $2,350 per month on a month-to-month basis. In July 2019, the Company’s newly installed management ceased renting this office space.

Our Jiangsu Shengfeng joint venture, of which the Company owns 49% and as further described in “Business—Introduction”, owns facilities of approximately 400,000 square feet, consisting of approximately 200,000 square feet of manufacturing space and 200,000 square feet of general office and engineering space. The Jiangsu Shengfeng facilities are fully paid for and there is no monthly or annual rent associated with these facilities. The Company is currently in default on its obligations to the joint venture by failing to deliver on a Purchase order received in 2019 from the Joint Venture for approximately 100 systems, valued at approximately $1.25 million. Since assuming control in June 2019, new management has been engaged in discussions with our joint venture partner in order to cure the default.
 
As the Company begun to increase operations, we will need to renew relationships and contracts with our suppliers or locate suitable new suppliers for subassemblies and other components.
 
Research and Development
 
We believe that ongoing research and development is important to the success of our product in order to utilize the most recent technology, develop additional products and additional uses for existing products, stay current with changes in vehicle manufacture and design and maintain an advantage over potential competition. Our engineering, research and development costs for fiscal 2019 were approximately $500,000 compared to approximately $100,000 in fiscal 2018.
 
We reduced research and development activities in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 due to a severe cash shortfall; however, in fiscal 2019 we started redesign work on our Electronic Control Unit (“ECU”) to include state-of-the-art power electronics and processors. In September 2019 we successfully tested and implemented this newly designed ECU which will begin to be delivered to customers during fiscal 2020.
 
We set an initial budget of approximately $750,000 for research and development in fiscal 2020, dependent upon our ability to raise additional sources of funding. We believe that ongoing research and development is important to the success of our product in order to utilize the most recent technology, develop additional products and additional uses for existing products.

Patents and Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property portfolio consists of trademarks, proprietary know-how, trade secrets, and patents.
 
In the area of electromagnetic technology, we have developed numerous magnetic systems and designs that result in a significant increase of magnetic field density per unit volume that can be converted into useful power energy or work. This increase in field density is a factor of three to four, which, when incorporated into mechanical devices, could result in a significant reduction in size and cost of production for the same performance.
 
The applications of these technological advances are in machines used every day by industrial, commercial, and consumers. We have applied technology to numerous applications in industrial machines, such as generators, motors, actuators, and linear motors.
 
We hold the following patents: Nos. 5,734,217; 6,157,175; 6,700,214; 6,700,802; 8,955,624; with expiration dates in 2018, 2020, 2024, 2024 and 2033 respectively.
 
At the end of fiscal 2013 and the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we filed five new patent applications related to the AuraGen®. These new patent applications are specifically designed to cover the (i) integration of the AuraGen® power solution with transport refrigeration, (ii) the interface kit of the AuraGen® with prime movers, (iii) a water cooled AuraGen® solution for situations where ventilation is not available, (iv) a unique cable system with safety protection to transfer high power between two moving objects, and (v) a unique clamping of power electronic components to heat sink to ensure good thermal conductivity.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect the Company’s activities, which include, but are not limited to, the areas of labor, intellectual property and ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, environmental, and health and safety. As we recommence operations, our operations will again be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expect to expend resources to maintain compliance with OSHA requirements and industry best practices.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company has three full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, the Company engages independent contractors to support various areas of the business. The independent contractors are used on an as-needed basis.
Significant Customers
 
As of June 13, 2019, the Company had no significant customers other than an initial commitment of approximately $1.25 million to deliver AuraGen® systems and components to our Chinese joint venture. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, however, CBOL Corporation of Chatsworth, California has become a significant customer.
Backlog
 
As of June 13, 2019, there were no significant customers other than an initial order of AuraGen® systems and components representing approximately $1.25 million from our Chinese joint venture. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, however, the Company has a backlog of approximately $450,000 not related to the joint venture. Management believes that as the Company solidifies additional financial resources, significant additional backlog will develop. No assurances, however, can be given as to how long it will take the Company, if at all, to develop a further backlog.
Raw Materials
 
The most important raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are steel, copper, and aluminum. Raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States. We have no significant long-term supply contracts. When possible, we maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, which we believe contribute to our ability to obtain competitive pricing. The cost of some of our raw materials and shipping costs are dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on margins.
 
We enter into standard purchase agreements with certain foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected products. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf.
