Item 1. Business. 
General Development of Business
W. P. Carey Inc. (“W. P. Carey”), together with our consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors, is an internally-managed diversified REIT and a leading owner of commercial real estate, net-leased to companies located primarily in the United States and Northern and Western Europe on a long-term basis. The vast majority of our revenues originate from lease revenue provided by our real estate portfolio, which is comprised primarily of single-tenant industrial, warehouse, office, and retail facilities that are critical to our tenants’ operations. Our portfolio is comprised of 1,163 properties, net-leased to 304 tenants in 25 countries. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 63% of our contractual minimum annualized base rent (“ABR”) was generated by properties located in the United States and approximately 35% was generated by properties located in Europe. In addition, our portfolio includes 48 operating properties, comprised of 46 self-storage properties and two hotels, substantially all of which we acquired in connection with the CPA:17 Merger, as described below.
We also earn fees and other income by managing the portfolios of certain non-traded investment programs through our investment management business. Founded in 1973, we originally operated as sponsor and advisor to a series of non-traded investment programs under the Corporate Property Associates (“CPA”) brand name. We became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) in 1998 and reorganized as a REIT in 2012. In June 2017, we exited non-traded retail fundraising activities and no longer sponsor new investment programs. On October 31, 2018, one of our former investment programs, Corporate Property Associates 17 – Global Incorporated (“CPA:17 – Global”), merged into one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “CPA:17 Merger”), which added approximately $5.6 billion of assets to our portfolio and increased our equity market capitalization as of that date to approximately $10.6 billion.
Our shares of common stock are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “WPC.” Headquartered in New York, we also have offices in Dallas, London, and Amsterdam. At December 31, 2018, we had 206 employees.
Narrative Description of Business
Business Objectives and Strategy
Our primary business objective is to increase long-term stockholder value through accretive acquisitions and proactive asset management of our real estate portfolio, enabling us to grow our dividend.
Our investment strategy primarily focuses on owning and actively managing a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate that is net-leased to credit-worthy companies. We believe that many companies prefer to lease rather than own their corporate real estate because it allows them to deploy their capital more effectively into their core competencies. We generally structure financing for companies in the form of sale-leaseback transactions, where we acquire a company’s critical real estate and then lease it back to them on a long-term, triple-net basis, which requires them to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property (such as real estate taxes, insurance, and facility maintenance). Compared to other types of real estate investments, sale-leaseback transactions typically produce a more predictable income stream and require minimal capital expenditures, which in turn generate revenues that provide our stockholders with a stable, growing source of income.
We actively manage our real estate portfolio to monitor tenant credit quality and lease renewal risks. We believe that diversification across property type, tenant, tenant industry, and geographic location, as well as diversification of our lease expirations and scheduled rent increases, are vital aspects of portfolio risk management and accordingly have constructed a portfolio of real estate that we believe is well-diversified across each of these categories.
In addition to our real estate portfolio, as of December 31, 2018, we also managed assets, totaling approximately $7.6 billion, of the following entities: (i) Corporate Property Associates 18 – Global Incorporated (“CPA:18 – Global,” and together with CPA:17 – Global until October 31, 2018, the “CPA REITs”); (ii) two publicly owned, non-traded REITs that have invested in lodging and lodging-related properties: Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated (“CWI 1”) and Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (“CWI 2,” and together with CWI 1, the “CWI REITs”); and (iii) a private limited partnership formed for the purpose of developing, owning, and operating student housing properties and similar investments in Europe: Carey European Student Housing Fund I, L.P. (“CESH”). As used herein, “Managed REITs” refers to the CPA REITs and the CWI REITS. At the date of this Report, all of these programs had fully invested the funds raised in their offerings. 

W. P. Carey 2018 10-K – 3

In June 2017, in alignment with our long-term strategy of focusing exclusively on net lease investing for our own balance sheet, our board of directors (our “Board”) approved a plan to exit non-traded retail fundraising activities carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiary Carey Financial LLC (“Carey Financial”), which was a registered broker-dealer. As a result, Carey Financial ceased active fundraising on behalf of the Managed Programs, as defined below, on June 30, 2017 and deregistered as a broker-dealer as of October 11, 2017. In August 2017, we resigned as the advisor to Carey Credit Income Fund, effective on September 11, 2017 (known since October 23, 2017 as Guggenheim Credit Income Fund) (“CCIF”) and by extension its feeder funds (“CCIF Feeder Funds,” and together with CCIF, the “Managed BDCs”), each of which is a business development company (“BDC”). We refer to the Managed REITs, CESH, and, prior to our resignation as their advisor, the Managed BDCs as the “Managed Programs.” We continue to act as the advisor to the remaining Managed Programs and currently expect to do so through the end of their respective life cycles (Note 4).
We intend to operate our business in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we expect to manage our investments in order to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investment Strategies
When considering potential net-lease investments for our real estate portfolio, we review various aspects of a transaction to determine whether the investment and lease structure will satisfy our investment criteria. We generally analyze the following main aspects of each transaction:
Tenant/Borrower Evaluation — We evaluate each potential tenant or borrower for creditworthiness, typically considering factors such as management experience, industry position and fundamentals, operating history, and capital structure. We also rate each asset based on its market, liquidity, and criticality to the tenant’s operations, as well as other factors that may be unique to a particular investment. We seek opportunities where we believe the tenant may have a stable or improving credit profile or credit potential that has not been fully recognized by the market. We define creditworthiness as a risk-reward relationship appropriate to our investment strategies, which may or may not coincide with ratings issued by the credit rating agencies. We have a robust internal credit rating system and may designate a tenant as “implied investment grade” even if the credit rating agencies have not made a rating determination.
Properties Critical to Tenant/Borrower Operations — We generally focus on properties and facilities that we believe are critical to the ongoing operations of the tenant. We believe that these properties generally provide better protection, particularly in the event of a bankruptcy, since a tenant/borrower is less likely to risk the loss of a critically important lease or property in a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise.
Diversification — We attempt to diversify our portfolio to avoid undue dependence on any one particular tenant, borrower, collateral type, geographic location, or industry. By diversifying our portfolio, we seek to reduce the adverse effect of a single underperforming investment or a downturn in any particular industry or geographic region. While we do not set any fixed diversity metrics in our portfolio, we believe that it is well-diversified.
Lease Terms — Generally, the net-leased properties we invest in are leased on a full-recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, the vast majority of our leases provide for scheduled rent increases over the term of the lease (see Our Portfolio below). These rent increases are either fixed (i.e., mandated on specific dates) or tied to increases in inflation indices (e.g., the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) or similar indices in the jurisdiction where the property is located), but may contain caps or other limitations, either on an annual or overall basis. In the case of retail stores and hotels, the lease may provide for participation in the gross revenues of the tenant above a stated level, which we refer to as percentage rent. 
Real Estate Evaluation — We review and evaluate the physical condition of the property and the market in which it is located. We consider a variety of factors, including current market rents, replacement cost, residual valuation, property operating history, demographic characteristics of the location and accessibility, competitive properties, and suitability for re-leasing. We obtain third-party environmental and engineering reports and market studies when required. When considering an investment outside the United States, we will also consider factors particular to a country or region, including geopolitical risk, in addition to the risks normally associated with real property investments. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Transaction Provisions to Enhance and Protect Value — When negotiating leases with potential tenants, we attempt to include provisions that we believe help to protect the investment from material changes in the tenant’s operating and financial characteristics, which may affect the tenant’s ability to satisfy its obligations to us or reduce the value of the investment. Such provisions include covenants requiring our consent for certain activities, requiring indemnification protections and/or security

deposits, and requiring the tenant to satisfy specific operating tests. We may also seek to enhance the likelihood that a tenant will satisfy their lease obligations through a letter of credit or guaranty from the tenant’s parent or other entity. Such credit enhancements, if obtained, provide us with additional financial security. However, in markets where competition for net-lease transactions is strong, some or all of these lease provisions may be difficult to obtain. In addition, in some circumstances, tenants may retain the option to repurchase the property, typically at the greater of the contract purchase price or the fair market value of the property at the time the option is exercised.
Competition — We face active competition from many sources, both domestically and internationally, for net-lease investment opportunities in commercial properties. In general, we believe that our management’s experience in real estate, credit underwriting, and transaction structuring will allow us to compete effectively for commercial properties. However, competitors may be willing to accept rates of return, lease terms, other transaction terms, or levels of risk that we find unacceptable.

Asset Management
We believe that proactive asset management is essential to maintaining and enhancing property values. Important aspects of asset management include entering into new or modified transactions to meet the evolving needs of current tenants, re-leasing properties, credit and real estate risk analysis, building expansions and redevelopments, and strategic dispositions.
We monitor compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of our real estate investments on an ongoing basis, which typically involves ensuring that each tenant has paid real estate taxes and other expenses relating to the properties it occupies and is maintaining appropriate insurance coverage. To ensure such compliance at our international properties, we often engage the expertise of third parties to complete property inspections. We also review tenant financial statements and undertake regular physical inspections of the properties to verify their condition and maintenance. Additionally, we periodically analyze each tenant’s financial condition, the industry in which each tenant operates, and each tenant’s relative strength in its industry.
Financing Strategies 
We believe in maintaining ample liquidity, a conservative capital structure, and access to multiple forms of capital. We preserve balance sheet flexibility and liquidity by maintaining significant capacity on our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility”). We generally use the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility to fund our immediate capital needs, including new acquisitions and the repayment of secured mortgage debt as we continue to transition to a more unencumbered balance sheet. We seek to replace short-term financing with more permanent forms of capital, including, but not limited to, common stock, unsecured debt securities, bank debt, and proceeds from asset sales. When evaluating which form of capital to pursue, we take into consideration multiple factors, including our corporate leverage levels and targets, the most advantageous sources of capital available to us, and the optimal timing to raise new capital. We strive to maintain an investment grade rating that places limitations on the amount of leverage acceptable in our capital structure. Although we expect to continue to have access to a wide variety of capital sources and maintain our investment grade rating, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.
