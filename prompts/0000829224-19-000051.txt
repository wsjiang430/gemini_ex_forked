Item 1. Business
General
Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 81 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S. A. ("Nestlé"). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi.
Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S., and in newer, higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. We also believe our Starbucks Global Social Impact strategy, commitments related to ethically sourcing high-quality coffee, contributing positively to the communities we do business in and being an employer of choice are contributors to our objective.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”
Segment Financial Information
Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned Starbucks operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific ("CAP") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") segment have been combined into one International segment. Concurrently, results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks ReserveTM Roastery & Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. 
We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2019 were as follows: Americas (69%), International (23%) and Channel Development (8%).
Our Americas and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are either in various stages of development or undergoing transformations of their business models. Therefore, they may require a more extensive support organization, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations.
Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Seattle's Best Coffee®, Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino®, Starbucks Doubleshot®, Starbucks Refreshers® beverages and TeavanaTM/MC iced tea, and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically our consumer packaged goods ("CPG") have been sold directly to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies. With the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, a large portion of our Channel Development business transitioned to a licensed model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Our collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Anheuser-Busch InBev, Tingyi Holding Corp., Arla Foods and others for our global ready-to-drink beverage businesses in this segment are excluded from the Global Coffee Alliance.

Revenue Components
We generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. 
Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of September 29, 2019

 | Americas | As a% of TotalAmericas Stores | | International | As a% of TotalInternational Stores | Total | | As a% ofTotal Stores
Company-operated stores | 9,974 | | 55 | % | 5,860 | | 44 | % | 15,834 | 51 | %
Licensed stores | 8,093 | | 45 | % | 7,329 | | 56 | % | 15,422 | 49 | %
Total | 18,067 | | 100 | % | 13,189 | | 100 | % | 31,256 | 100 | %

The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region.
Company-operated Stores
Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 81% of total net revenues during fiscal 2019. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience. The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service and a seamless digital experience as well as clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty.
Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and local business practices.

Starbucks® company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and in select rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly Drive Thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are focused on an elevated Starbucks Experience for our customers.

Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program
The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan, and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained on-line, via the Starbucks® Mobile App, and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks® Mobile App in participating stores. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks® Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program.
Licensed Stores
Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2019. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.
In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.

Other Revenues 
Other revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically, revenues have included domestic and international sales of our packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies. With the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, other revenues include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestlé under this arrangement and the amortization of the up-front prepaid royalty. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Deferred Revenues, for further information. Our collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Anheuser-Busch InBev, Tingyi Holding Corp., Arla Foods and others for our global ready-to-drink beverages businesses in this segment are excluded from the Global Coffee Alliance.
Product Supply
Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees.
The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In 
addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.
We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge "C" price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2020.
We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.
To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates nine farmer support centers. The farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts.
In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote.
Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks® stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote.
Competition
Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.
Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. 
Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names
Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Teavana, Frappuccino and Starbucks VIA are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” “Starbucksreserve.com,” “Seattlesbest.com” and “Teavana.com.”
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Employees
Starbucks employed approximately 346,000 people worldwide as of September 29, 2019. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 218,000 people, with approximately 209,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 128,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 124,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.
