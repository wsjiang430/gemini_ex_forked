ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc. (formerly known as On the Move Systems Corp.) (“AITX” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida on March 25, 2010 and reincorporated in Nevada on February 17, 2015. On August 24, 2018, Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions Inc., changed its name from On the Move Systems Corp (“AITX”).

Robotic Assistance Devices, LLC (“RAD”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 26, 2016 as a LLC and was founded by current President Steve Reinharz. On July 25, 2017, Robotic Assistance Devices LLC converted to a C Corporation, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. through the issuance of 10,000 common shares to its sole shareholder.

On August 28, 2017, AITX completed the acquisition of RAD (the “Acquisition”), whereby AITX acquired all the ownership and equity interest in RAD for 3,350,000 shares of AITX Series E Preferred Stock and 2,450 shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. AITX’s prior business focus was transportation services, and AITX was exploring the on-demand logistics market by developing a network of logistics partnerships. As a result of the closing of the Acquisition, AITX has succeeded to the business of RAD, in which AITX purchased all the outstanding shares of capital stock of RAD. As a result, AITX’s business going forward will consist of one segment activity which is the delivery of artificial intelligence and robotic solutions for operational, security and monitoring needs.

The Acquisition was treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since substantially all of AITX’s operations were disposed of as part of the consummation of the transaction. Therefore, no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by AITX as a result of the Acquisition. RAD is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders control the Company after the Acquisition, even though AITX was the legal acquirer.  As a result, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of RAD as if RAD had always been the reporting company.

AITX’s prior business focus was transportation services, and we were previously exploring the on-demand logistics market by seeking to develop a network of logistics partnerships. On August 28, 2017, AITX acquired all the outstanding shares of RAD . Following the RAD acquisition, the Company is focused on applying advanced artificial intelligence (AI) driven technologies, paired with multi-use hardware and supported by custom software and cloud services, to intelligently automate and integrate a variety of high frequency security, concierge and operational tasks.

RAD’s solutions are offered as a recurring monthly subscription, typically with a minimum 12 month subscription contract. RAD’s solutions earn over 75% gross margin over the life of each deployed asset. Specifically, RAD provides workflow automation solutions delivered through a system of hardware, software and cloud services. All elements of hardware and software design offered by RAD are 100% designed, developed and owned by RAD.

Mission

AITX’ mission is to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to solve enterprise problems that can be categorized as expensive, repetitive and outside of the core competencies of the prospect organization.

A short list of basic examples include:


1. | Typical security guard related functions such as monitoring a parking lot during and after hours and responding appropriately. This scenario applies to perimeters, interior yard areas and related similar environments.
2. | Integrated hardware/software with Artificial Intelligence driven responses, simulating and expanding on what legacy or manned solutions could perform. 
3. | Automation of common access control functions through technology utilized facial recognition and machine vision, leapfrogging most legacy solutions in use today. 


- 1 -

 RAD solutions are unique in the fact they:


1. | Start with an AI-driven response with the easy ability to connect to manned response. 
2. | Use unique hardware purpose built by RAD for delivery of these solutions. 
3. | Deliver services through RAD-developed software and cloud services, allowing enterprise IT groups to focus on core competencies instead of maintenance of complex video and security platforms.


RAD’s first industry focus is the $ 100B+ global security services market. (1)

RAD’s founder, Steve Reinharz, has 20+ years in various leadership/ownership roles in the security industry and was part of a successful exit to a global multinational security company in 2004. Mr. Reinharz has built a committed team of employees that have demonstrated tremendous productivity and self-sacrifice to advance the stated mission.

RAD’s current goal is to disrupt and capture a significant portion of both the human security guard market ($30B +) (2) and ‘physical security’ (cctv, access control, etc.) market ($20B +) through it’s innovative RAD solution ecosystem.

 (2) https://www.statista.com/statistics/294206/revenue-of-security-services-in-the-us/

AITX Expected Acquisitions

It is expected that AITX will acquire 2 remaining complementary companies owned by Mr. Reinharz sometime before the end of fiscal year 2020. These companies will be completely rolled into AITX as-is with no special compensation to Mr. Reinharz as setout below.

Mr. Reinharz has not taken any cash salary or earnings from RAD, AITX or any related entity since inception of the RAD in 2016.

BOLO Technologies, Inc., wholly owned by Mr. Reinharz, has had its limited assets of Intellectual Property and software formally integrated into RAD without necessity of any acquisition by RAD. BOLO created an innovative security-centric platform that integrates additional technologies to give security directors and law enforcement the easiest access to create, manage and track ‘Be On The Lookout’ (BOLO) alerts. ‘BOLO’ is a security industry term used to label interesting suspects such as disgruntled former employees, persons of interest wanted for questioning related to suspicious events and several other similar types of functions and services. BOLO Technologies will use advanced AI for data correlation and pattern matching and is focused on giving customers the ability to pre-empt, predict and prevent possible incidents. BOLO uses a service model similar to RAD’s robots-as-a-service model. 

‘RAD Canada’, wholly owned by Mr. Reinharz, provides most of the Research & Development for RAD’s solutions. Specifically, all RAD hardware solutions are designed and developed by this entity as well as some firmware, software and cloud software elements. All but two RAD Canada resources have been absorbed into RAD.

AITX, with these acquisitions, will enjoy the benefits of a skilled R&D group that includes skilled industrial and software engineers plus a security-focused platform that provides unique services in high demand. Mr. Reinharz will remain President of all AITX subsidiaries.

Background - First Commercial Rugged Outdoor Security Robot

RAD was started by Mr. Reinharz in the summer of 2016. RAD originally partnered with SMP Robotics Systems Corp (SMP). and commercialized the SMP S5 Robot for the security market. RAD’s commercialization of the platform focused on integrating traditional security industry manufacturers’ solutions onto the robotics platform. After two paid Proof of Concepts for large utility companies (under NDA) and over 18 months of development and testing RAD began deployments with various Fortune 500 customers. These deployments were scheduled to begin in October 2017 but were delayed until December 2017 due to various supply chain challenges. 

By March 2018 it was apparent that S5 platform promotion and development was not sustainable and RAD began to pull robots out of service. 

- 2 -

 The Robots were rejected by customers due to unsatisfactory reliability and some technical flaws that could not be solved despite full efforts by SMP and RAD. RAD now considers this phase of the company ‘Phase 1’ into robotics. Over 40 deployments were attempted during this period.

RAD has had no contact with SMP Robotics since April 2018.

Much of RAD’s existing convertible debt was acquired in support of the RAD/SMP robotics program.

Background – RAD’s 2nd Generation Ecosystem

RAD’s primary strategy has always been to use AI technology and modern systems to transform the security industry. Mobile robots, indoor and outdoor, are a part of that strategy. However, to completely realize the delivery of these solutions a set of ’stationary robots’ required development.

These stationary robots launched in April 2018 with the Security Control and Observation Tower (SCOT, development of which began in August 2017. SCOT performs many of the same functions of a stationary human security guard, plus many features that human guards cannot perform, and at approximately 15% of the cost. There is no known comparable solution available today that blends technology, usability, special features and cost. This is why SCOT has growing demand and has received considerable accolades.

SCOT’s positive market reception reinvigorated RAD and the focus turned to accelerating the development of the software and cloud services that support SCOT.

SCOT runs on the RAD Software Suite™, as all RAD security solutions do. This software suite is a cloud and mobile solution that is the heart of RAD’s security solution.

After extraordinary efforts by the team, beta SCOT was first shown to customers in Ohio at the end of February 2018. This beta exposition was to test customer reception and receive final voice-of-the-customer input. Security representatives from Cincinnati Reds, Cincinnati Bengals, Cincinnati Police Departments and County of Hamilton Sheriff’s Department were shown this early SCOT and gave SCOT and the preliminary RAD Software Suite a tremendous endorsement. Feedback was incorporated into SCOT and ideas on SCOT derivatives were added to the hardware development roadmap.

At the ISC West show in April 2018 SCOT won three awards: (1) a SIA New Product Award for Law Enforcement/Guarding, (2) 2018 Secure Campus Award from Campus Security and Life Safety and (3) a ‘Govie’ award for government security solutions from Security Today.

(1) SIA’s New Product Showcase recognizes innovative products, services and solutions in electronic physical security, and SCOT™’s award comes in the Law Enforcement/Guarding Systems category. Technologies within the program are used in the protection of life and property in residential, commercial and institutional settings, displaying SCOT™’s importance in long-range human detection and acting as a force multiplier for safety and defense against outside threats.

(2) RAD’s pivot to SCOT and its future derivatives is complete and current facilities can produce a mix of up to 100 units per month with moderate additional investment in equipment and manpower. 

RAD has not submitted for any awards since mid-2018 but expects future awards participation.

Currently Available Hardware Solutions

RAD’s hardware lineup has improved and expanded since initial launch in April 2018. RAD’s hardware lineup includes:


1. | ’SCOT 2.0’ has replaced SCOT 1.x. SCOT 1 went through three significant upgrades over the first 12 months of launch to arrive at SCOT 1.3. SCOT 1.3 features a mature software platform and a refined hardware platform. SCOT solutions have operated with over 99% uptime since inception. ’SCOT’ is an acronym for ’Security Control and Observation Tower’. It embodies and offers the full complement of solutions driven by the RAD Cloud.
 | SCOT 2.0 is a SCOT 1.3 enclosed in an appealing modern enclosure. It also features additional LCD monitors (like a Wally), curved LED panels to support visibility and flexible messaging (as opposed to SCOT 1.x flat LED panels) and an advanced locking system. SCOT 2.0 is the realization of the concepts pioneered, demonstrated and tested throughout the 1.x lineup. The SCOT lineup is indoor/outdoor rated. 


- 3 -

 
 | All SCOT1.x units continue to perform and generate revenue for the company. There are no immediately plans to replace 1.x units with 2.0 units. SCOT 1.x units can be supported indefinitely under RAD’s software architecture. It is expected that in time these 1.x units will be applied to industrial applications where aesthetics are secondary to functionality.
2. | ‘WALLY’ was announced in June 2018 in the Allied Universal Services, Inc., booth at the BOMA International Show in San Antonio. WALLY is a wall-mounted derivative of SCOT that is also indoor/outdoor rated. It’s designed to bring the RAD ecosystem to areas such as main lobbies, elevator lobbies, dock access areas and more. 
3. | ‘FRED’ was announced in September 2018 and is a complement to the RAD ecosystem by just focusing on various verified entry methods. Appropriate for office access and to be mounted on gate stanchions. 
4. | ‘ROSA’ was announced to specific dealers and customers in May 2019. Official general market introduction should happen by August of 2019. ROSA is an acronym for Responsive Observation Security Agent. 

Software Solutions

RAD has created a variety of front-end and back-end software solutions to power its ecosystem. Customer facing software includes RADGUARD (on the touchscreens of RAD’s field devices) and RADSOC (Security Operations Center) and RADPMC (Property Management Center).

RAD has developed a variety of utilities that allow automatic over-the-air updates, most of which is within a back-end application called SCOT Manager.

RAD has written world class Visitor Management, Access Control and other applications instead of seeking to partner with legacy manufacturers. It is RAD’s opinion that the legacy paradigm in the physical space underserves the markets in terms of cost, functionality and integration.

RAD has recently integrated its own Video Management System into RADSOC that includes full integration to a variety of features related to security and properly management functions.

RAD’s ability to deliver easy to use, easy to obtain, and easy to support software, combined with custom workflow-automation applications, is the key to RAD’s value proposition.

Manufacturing & Assembly

RAD uses a variety of domestic and overseas machine shops for raw material procurement and machining of the required plastic and metal pieces that build RAD devices. 

RAD’s sourcing has redundancy through use of multiple machine shops producing the same products for RAD.

There is no piece of any RAD device that can only be procured from one supplier.

RAD’s margins are based on current small batch production and assembly. Economies of scale will drive greater gross margin as quantities and efficiencies increase.

RAD’s primary assembly and configuration location is in Southern California. It is anticipated that as RAD outgrows its existing facility these functions will be moved out of state, most likely to mid-west location. RAD’s California location would remain as the West Coast Sales & Service Center.

Anticipated location for a comprehensive assembly location is Michigan. This location provides central access to RAD’s largest markets as well as easy access from RAD’s R&D center outside of Toronto, Canada. 

Tariff Impact

Anticipated tariffs of 25% across all imported items, not yet in effect, would impact US production costs by an additional 10%. If this happens RAD anticipates absorbing this cost for US units but supplying Canadian demand from local Canadian production (instead of from the US).

 Roadmap

RAD anticipates two major hardware product releases in fiscal 2020.

First, RAD announced a return to the mobile unmanned ground vehicle market at the end of July 2019. This ground drone will benefit from significant innovations during the first 12 months following launch. It’s expected these advanced applications will spawn several ‘killer apps’ that will put this unit, and the RAD Ecosystem, in high demand.

Second, RAD anticipates release of an entirely new solution currently in early stage development. This new solution will become a critical component of the RAD ecosystem.

Furthermore there could be a third significant addition depending on technical and market conditions.

RAD expects to release Wally 2.0 and FRED 2.0 in fiscal 2020. These upgrades are minor.

Team and Culture

AITX has built a strong start-up culture based on performance, sacrifice and rewards. RAD begins every interview with a review of the eight elements that comprise RAD Culture and candidates are encouraged to understand that this is not a traditional company. As a startup RAD faces challenges of limited resources and time and as such, the team members are open to multitasking and wearing multiple hats, as the situation demands, thus allowing the management team to focus on the larger goals and steer the company in the right direction. Our solid RAD team, all share in the same beliefs and core values of the Company; so we easily adjust to changes thus giving RAD an edge in the market. The core team really determines the fate of a company and RAD is no stranger to the difficulties that face a startup, such as unexpected setbacks, delays in funding or a cash crunch. At RAD the whole team has pitched in, doing whatever they can, from working to meet tight deadlines; or willing partaking in financial sacrifices; to assisting where and whenever needed, creating a core team willing to standby the company through the testing times.

RAD’s culture has provided strength throughout the difficult period of robot deployments and the transition to 2nd generation solutions. 

Market Environment

RAD experience has proved that the security market is ripe for disruption. Having captured the interest of many Fortune 500 companies (names generally protected under NDA) including Microsoft, Verizon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, among many others, no other known company has the solutions, distribution channel, reputation, sales or support model to rival RAD in the near term.

Furthermore, the launch of RAD’s mobile solutions will create additional significant distance between any would-be competitors. RAD will be a one-stop shop for proven and comprehensive mobile and stationary workflow improvement devices and systems. 

RAD’s technology model includes a ‘new paradigm’ for the security industry: Security in a box. Every RAD solution features connection to the RAD Software Suite which is a platform for AI processing, usage analytics, cloud served video, communications interface, audit logs and much more.

Positive market reception for RAD solutions are due to the following existing conditions:


1. | The security guard industry is characterized by poor customer satisfaction and industry consolidation. It’s self-described to be a ‘race to the bottom’ to provide the lowest cost services to end users because generally speaking end users require some security for general crime deterrent and insurance purposes. There are 1.1M security guards in the United States and the security guard industry represents over $20B in annual sales and the average security guard bill rate is $20/hour.
2. | Enterprise organizations’ security divisions/groups are continuously challenged to reduce cost. For example, Universal Parcel Service (UPS) spends over $120M/year in security guard services, Lockheed Martin over $60M/year and NBC Universal over $25M/year. The security guard industry has not had any significant disruption or innovation since inception. 
3. | Guarding companies struggle to offer quality service at a reasonable price. Security organizations are eagerly receptive to solutions that improve performance and reduce cost. 


- 5 -

 
4. | RAD’s device rental model allows clients to immediately save significant operating costs. With RAD’s current stationary solutions retailing from under $1/hour to $5/hour we can immediately provide substantial savings and significant additional security. 
5. | RAD’s services options allow end users to incorporate or fully replace their existing Security Operation Centers with RAD solutions. This integrated with RAD’s “Solutions-As-A-Service” Rental Program offers customized options to help organizations achieve operational and security goals.


The above conditions speak to the historical lack of innovation in the guarding market largely driven by the lack of development of truly revolutionary systems. This market is now positioned for major disruption with the application of AI based solutions, as lead by RAD. As such, the interest in RAD solutions has been overwhelming. Major companies, including the U.S. largest guarding company Allied Universal Services, are aligning with RAD to offer these services to their customer base.

RAD Solutions Customer Acceptance

RAD end users include one Top 10 company and many Fortune 500 companies. RAD is currently deployed in logistics, commercial real estate, healthcare and retail industries. If RAD deployed to only 5% of any one of these industries facilities the company would enjoy tremendous profitability. 

Due to the nature of existing non-disclosure agreements RAD does not normally share customer lists or specific deployment details.

RAD’s batch production of SCOTs & WALLYS have all been committed prior to the completion of the production cycle, with an average delivery time of 45 days. RAD has set a goal, predicated on regular demand, to reduce delivery time to 15 days. 

RAD Industry Leadership Role

Mr. Reinharz has earned a prominent role as a spokesperson for AI and change in the security industry. He has lectured and participated in several panels for some of the security industries largest events and organizations. Mr. Reinharz sits on the SIA’s Autonomous Working Group committee which is dedicated to helping shape the industry and support progressive legislation. Most recently Mr. Reinharz provided NY City’s ASIS CPP group a lecture that qualified as a continuing education credit.

RAD gets exposure to prospects, customers and investors through Mr. Reinharz’s efforts to educate the security market. Blogs and industry published articles can be found in the news section of www.roboticassistancedevices.com
It is expected that Mr. Reinharz continues his promotion of the new paradigm for the next few years until adoption is widespread.

Financing

RAD has entered into three royalty revenue agreements and taken on limited additional direct debt to sustain operations and research and development as the company drives towards positive cash flow. Furthermore Steve Reinharz has provided over an additional $250,000 plus 100% deferred earnings during this rebuilding period. Steve Reinharz has received no cash salary and has pledged to receive no salary payouts until RAD has positive cash flow. All RAD employees have also made financial contributions and sacrifices during this period of focus on profitability.

However, positive cash flow cannot fund the pace of expected deployments. As such RAD has been working on alternative funding options. The expected success and durability of RAD’s solutions, and depth and breadth of the sales funnel has attracted the attention of various asset funding companies. 

RAD has engaged with one such company that has provided RAD with a term sheet for a starting line of credit up to $2,000,000. The terms provide RAD enough capital for the deployment of units that can generate annual revenue between $2,500,000 and $ 4,000,000 depending on product mix and sales channel. The company that has provided this term sheet has assured RAD that the financing can be expanded well beyond $10,000,000 under expected circumstances. RADs largest client has updated contracts required to allow this financing to take place. RAD estimates they are in the last 50% of work required to secure this financing.

 RAD is engaged in supplemental financing efforts based on existing and future streams of revenue that will provide additional non-dilutive funding to the company. As these efforts mature updates will be issued or shared in the relevant filings.

Go To Market Strategy

RAD’s strategy continues to focus on creation and support of a strong dealer channel. This affords multiple benefits to RAD with few downsides. RAD has successfully integrated through the largest US guarding company and recently signed another top 3 guarding company as a RAD dealer. Furthermore, RAD has been signing up and developing mid-sized and smaller dealers. RAD is on track to develop a focused group of dealers of which most will exclusively represent RAD solutions. 

Supplemental to that RAD will, under certain circumstances, accept subscriptions directly from end users. These situations are largely characterized by the end user not having a guarding company, having a guarding company that RAD does not want as a dealer or other extenuating circumstances. RAD has no desired ratio of dealer vs direct subscriptions. Dealer subscriptions remain the primary focus. 

Competition

RAD has no direct competition save for one immediate competitor and one potential competitor as disclosed in Risk factors on page 11.

RAD is considered part of the ‘drones’ category of the security industry although at RAD we consider ourselves to be in the workflow automation industry. 

RAD deliberately restricts information that is public for three main reasons:


1. | Usually activities are covered by mutual non-disclosure agreements and RAD generally will not ask for permission to publicize customer activities. 
2. | These are generally security applications and most companies prefer to not advertise the details of their security systems. 
3. | Until RAD hits the ‘tipping point’ we prefer to keep our solutions stealthy to some extent so as not to give our would-be competitors tips to copy us.


It is anticipated that at some point some competition may enter the market. RAD seeks to maintain a 2+ year competitive advantage through a broad line of hardware solutions, the fastest and smoothest user interface and the strongest feature set with the most mature back-end. Furthermore RAD seeks to expand its sales staff and become the dominant incumbent in this new market that it has created.

RAD Results and Forecasts

At the time of this writing RAD has a contracted monthly run rate of over $ 30,000, the bulk of which is based on 2018 RAD pricing. RAD completed a price increase March 1, 2019 which allows positive cash flow achievement with 35% fewer deployments. Moreover, future orders that are allegedly in the final stages of customer procurement should allow RAD to achieve positive cash flow within 6 months or less.

RAD views itself as a fast growth technology company poised for exponential growth. RAD’s sales funnel is over 300 accounts strong in various stages of the sales process. Complementing that could be several hundred more accounts in progress with the dealer base that do not generally provide RAD with current or accurate sales funnel information. As an example, one dealer has shared a CRM report with over 180 accounts yet incoming subscriptions were never listed in the CRM.

Employees

As of June 7, 2019, we had 19 full-time employees and 2 contracted employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be excellent.
