Item 1.    Business
MasterBrand, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “MasterBrand” or the “Company”) was founded nearly 70 years ago in 1954 under the name United Cabinet Incorporated. We are the largest manufacturer of residential cabinets in North America, based on 2021 net sales. Our products are sold throughout the United States and Canada to the remodeling and new construction markets through three primary channels: dealers, retailers and builders.
On December 14, 2022, our former parent company, Fortune Brands Innovations, Inc. (formerly known as Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.) (“Fortune Brands”) completed a tax free spin-off transaction to separate its Cabinets segment into a standalone publicly-traded company (the “Separation”). The Separation was completed through a series of transactions ending with a pro rata distribution of all of the shares of MasterBrand, Inc. common stock owned by Fortune Brands to Fortune Brands stockholders (the “Distribution”). After the Distribution, we became an independent, publicly-traded company.
Strategy
Our superior product quality, innovative design and service excellence drives a compelling value proposition. We have insight into the fashion and features consumers desire, which we use to tailor our product lines across price points. Our volume leadership allows us to achieve an advantaged cost structure and service platform by standardizing product platforms and components to the greatest extent possible—resulting in a more flexible facility footprint and an efficient supply chain. Further, our decades of experience have informed how we use global geographies to optimize procurement and manufacturing costs. Finally, with the most extensive dealer network throughout the United States and Canada, we have an advantaged distribution model that cannot be easily replicated. We plan to further extend our competitive advantages by using technology and data to enhance the consumer’s experience from visualization and ordering to delivery and installation.
We believe we are only beginning to unlock the potential value of our unique combination of scale, operational agility, data-first operating model and strong continuous improvement culture. We intend to continue to distinguish this advantaged platform by capitalizing on the powerful demographic trends that we expect will drive repair and remodel (“R&R”) and new construction growth for years to come. We believe the combination of our leading market position and size, strategic vision, strong partnerships and commitment to continuous improvement will drive our future growth.
We seek to achieve exceptional financial performance and growth through the disciplined execution of The MasterBrand Way and our continued strategic transformation. 
The MasterBrand Way
Our ever-evolving business system and center of our culture is The MasterBrand Way. Based on foundational lean tools, The MasterBrand Way enables our associates across all locations and levels of work to operate under common frameworks and consistent lexicon to effectively develop cross-functional solutions to complex business issues. The MasterBrand Way organizes these proven lean tools around three guiding principles: The Four Basics, Continuous Improvement and Associate Engagement. Our disciplined deployment of these tools in recent years drove our strategic transformation and improvements in commercial and operational efficiency. To derive further efficiencies, we added three incremental initiatives to The MasterBrand Way: Align to Grow, Lead Through Lean and Tech Enabled.
Align to Grow – Deliver on the unique needs of each customer
As an organization that historically grew through acquisitions, processes across the disparate acquired companies was inherently different. We believe we have further opportunities to both commercially and operationally align our business to reduce complexity in our product offering to customers. We are focused on reducing complexity that consumers do not notice or value, without reducing the variety of choices available. Our ability to reduce complexity in our product offering, and move to common platforms, enables us to simplify our manufacturing processes as well. Common platforms across plants and standard work allows us to drive supply chain efficiencies. In addition to leveraging scale across our network, we believe these initiatives will reduce our lead times, allow for more rapid reaction to changing customer needs and preferences and increase our ability to respond to any future macroeconomic or other disruptions. We believe these factors will allow us to deliver on the unique needs of each customer and in the most efficient way possible.
Lead Through Lean – Engage teams and foster problem-solving
The MasterBrand Way and the associated lean tools not only drive efficiencies, but engage our associates in the process. The importance of human capital, specifically the ability to attract, retain and develop associates, has become more 
2


apparent in a post-pandemic world. Through weekly kaizen events across our manufacturing facilities and offices, we provide the individuals closest to our business problems with the training and tools required to fix these issues. Through empowering associates to remedy issues locally, it fosters problem-solving and enhances our culture of continuous improvement. Beyond improved engagement and retention, we are able to witness leadership amongst our associates and develop internal talent. As opportunities present themselves across the organization, we are positioned to staff these roles internally. Given the competition for skilled labor in North America, we believe our Lead Through Lean initiative will help us achieve exceptional financial performance.
Tech Enabled - Drive profitable growth and transform the way we work through digital, data, and analytics
We are focused on ways to transform our business and how we service our customers and, ultimately, the end consumer by leveraging technology. We see opportunities to leverage data and analytics across our back office, plant floor and through customer interactions. The consumer journey in residential kitchen and bath cabinets is evolving as new technologies become available to both consumers and manufacturers. Beyond a transactional process, the consumer journey is increasingly relationship-based, starting from the initial contact or touchpoint, continuing through the buying cycle and finishing at the end of installation. Customers prefer partners that can support them through this evolving landscape, and consumers are demanding a transformation of the buying process. We are utilizing data-first strategies like net promoter scores and web analytics to unlock insights into customer and consumer trends and drive improvements in the consumer experience. We believe we can further differentiate ourselves as the leader in this space by continuing to invest in digital tools and sophisticated data analytics capabilities that will improve the overall experience, speed to market and access to information, allowing us to serve consumers’ evolving needs and capture additional sales growth.
In addition, we believe there is ongoing potential in the e-commerce channel for cabinets and vanities. We believe there is opportunity for us to expand in this channel, through known large e-commerce platforms, our existing retailers’ websites, digital native specialized e-tailors or direct-to-consumer opportunities. As a result of our scale, our streamlined product offerings and our existing relationships, we believe we are uniquely positioned to win in the e-commerce space, and we plan to be the market leader in this high-potential channel.
Execute strategic acquisitions that broaden our platform and capitalize on our proven strengths. 
Our Company was built in part through strategic, well-executed acquisitions, and we have proven to be a highly effective consolidation platform. We believe we will have opportunities to drive future value creation through thoughtful and strategic acquisitions. We regularly monitor the landscape for attractive opportunities that could allow us to leverage our operations and strong customer relationships, expand our portfolio of products and expand into new categories and geographies. We expect to drive long-term stockholder value by utilizing a disciplined process to identify, evaluate, and execute strategic acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses.
Channels
Our products are sold throughout the United States and Canada to the remodeling and new construction markets through three primary channels: dealers, retailers and builders.
1.Dealers: We have built the industry’s largest and, we believe, strongest network, with well-established relationships with over 4,500 cabinet dealers across the United States and Canada, many with whom we have worked for decades. Our dealers cover a wide portion of the market, with some specializing in R&R, while others provide regional service to a variety of new construction home builders. Our extensive dealer network allows us to have exceptional market reach and the ability to target key growth areas.
2.Retailers: We serve the top retailers in North America and have developed strong and lasting partnerships with them, as a result of our category management and commitment to best-in-class execution.
3.Builders: We strategically partner with the industry’s best and most profitable builders for single-family construction.
In addition, we are actively growing our presence in the emerging cabinets e-commerce channel, including through our channel partners’ online presence, and are actively partnering with leading players to develop continuing opportunities to penetrate and innovate in this exciting category.
Products
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of leading residential cabinetry products for the kitchen, bathroom and other parts of the home. Our products are available in a wide variety of designs, finishes and styles and span the most attractive 
3


categories of the cabinets market: stock, semi-custom and premium cabinetry. Our unique product portfolio allows homeowners to create the living spaces of their dreams, tailored to their price point and personalized for their individual style. While our product offerings may overlap in different categories, they generally follow the following characteristics: (1) stock products provide consumers with a strong value proposition at entry level pricing, and these products benefit from low design complexity, standardized components and shorter lead times, while also offering exceptional quality and reliability; (2) semi-custom products offer more styles and features than stock cabinets, allowing consumers to create a more personalized space at a lower price point compared to premium products; and finally, (3) premium products enable consumers to achieve their dream home by designing highly customized cabinets to meet their exact specifications—if they can dream it, we can make it.
Customers
Our business competes based on quality, price, service and responsiveness to dealer, retailer and builder needs, as well as end-user consumer preferences. Our markets are very competitive. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (“Lowe’s”) comprised approximately 20 percent and 18 percent of our net sales for our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively. The Home Depot, Inc. (“The Home Depot”) comprised approximately 17 percent and 18 percent of our net sales for our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively. Approximately 6 percent of our net sales for both of our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years were to international markets.
Raw Materials
We utilize raw materials in the operation of our business, principally hardwoods (maple, birch and oak), plywood and particleboard. These materials are available from a number of sources. Volatility in the prices of commodities and transportation costs in making and distributing our products impacts the cost of manufacturing our products.
Intellectual Property
In addition to the brand protection offered by our trademarks, patent protection helps distinguish our unique product features in the market by preventing others from making, using, importing, and selling our innovations in markets in which we have patent protection. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various features used in products we sell. Although we rely on certain patents and patent groups that provide important protections to us, no single patent or patent group is material to our business as a whole.
Seasonality
We traditionally experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year when new home construction and R&R activity are at their lowest. As a result of sales seasonality and associated timing of working capital fluctuations, our cash flow from operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the year.
Environmental Matters
We endeavor to be a leader in environmental compliance and sustainability. Since 2018, we have partnered with the National Forest Foundation (“NFF”) tree planting campaign. NFF works with U.S. Forest Service to promote the health and public enjoyment of our 193-million-acre National Forest System. We support NFF’s campaign to plant 50 million trees across national forests.
We reserve for remediation activities to clean up potential environmental liabilities as required by federal and state laws based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. There were no material environmental accruals for the years ended December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other potentially responsible parties under Superfund or similar state laws or from insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Governmental Regulations
We are subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations in the countries where we conduct business. This includes compliance with the Lacey Act, governing trade in wildlife, fish, and plants in the U.S., and the Toxic Substances Act, which relates to the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals in the U.S. Compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of employees, as well as financial resources. During 2022, compliance with the applicable regulations did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 25, 2022, we had more than 13,000 full-time and part-time associates (excluding contract workers). Approximately 83 percent of our workforce is composed of hourly production and distribution associates and the remaining population is composed of associates in administrative roles. As of December 25, 2022, approximately 33 percent of our associates worked under collective bargaining agreements. Below is a summary of the number of associates by role as of December 25, 2022:

Production and Distribution | Office | Total 
11,392 | 2,262 | 13,654

We are a values-based organization and believe our strong culture is a true differentiator. We are guided by “The MasterBrand Way;” a cultural foundation of empowering teams to trust the process and knowledge from those closest to the work, embracing the full, diverse team of individuals and experiences, and a drive to move forward and be better every day. We build associate opportunity, purpose, and reward into everything we do creating a culture where our associates can thrive. We invest in our teams and develop our associates to become the next generation of leaders who seek out a continuous improvement mindset in all aspects of our business to unlock our full potential. We also endeavor to create a best place to work environment that keeps our associates safe, values their unique experiences and perspectives and fosters a culture of collaboration and belonging. We do this through the programs summarized below, and the objectives and related risks of each are overseen by our Board of Directors or its committees.
Health and Safety
Safety is a critical element to our growth strategy, integral to our culture and one of our core values. This is reflected in our goal of zero safety incidents and through our efforts to create an injury-free workplace. Our Employee Safety & Environmental Policies set standards for how we maintain a safe work environment and guides our business operations. We also have an Environmental, Health & Safety Leadership team comprised of representatives from across our operations that share best practices and are responsible for driving environmental, health and safety strategy. This helps drive our best-in-class programs designed to reinforce positive behaviors, to empower our associates to actively take part in maintaining a safe work environment, to heighten awareness and to mitigate risk on critical safety components. Within each of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we have site-specific safety and environmental plans designed to reduce risk. Through a continued commitment to improve our safety performance, we have historically been successful in reducing the number of injuries sustained by our associates. 
Two of our primary safety measures are the Total Recordable Incidence Rate (“TRIR”) and Lost Time Rate (“LTR”). For our 2022 fiscal year, our TRIR was 1.04, compared to 1.10 for our 2021 fiscal year, and our LTR was 0.26 for our 2022 fiscal year, compared to 0.34 for our 2021 fiscal year. Our safety focus is also demonstrated by comparing our TRIR and LTR to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) industry averages. For our 2022 fiscal year, our TRIR and LTR were below the 2021 BLS industry averages for each of 3.4 and 1.1, respectively.
Attracting and Retaining Superior Talent
To attract and retain superior talent at all levels of our Company, we have designed our offerings to be competitive and are seen as a community leader where our associates live and work. Our total rewards are designed to be market competitive, align incentives with our performance and provide physical, emotional, and financial well-being support to meet the individualized needs of our associates. We have a strong pay-for-performance culture that is supported by incentive programs that take into consideration business results and associate performance. We also offer a range of benefits including retirement savings plans, comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, wellness and associate assistance services. In 2022, we strengthened inclusivity in our benefit offerings by providing enhanced parental support benefits for our U.S. associates, including fertility benefits and specialized support from adoption and surrogacy assistance to pregnancy and post-partum.
Creating a Culture of DEI
We continue to take measured actions that create an inclusive culture and diverse workforce, increase representation and celebrate our diverse team of associates and experiences. We believe that attracting and engaging talented and diverse associates enables us to be more innovative, responsive to consumer needs and deliver strong performance and growth.
We are committed to increasing representation of professionals of color and women through hiring and promoting the right talent, ensuring an inclusive culture through proactive programs, business practices and education and by demonstrating support for equality in our communities through outreach and investment. As of December 25, 2022, our worldwide 
5


workforce was composed of approximately 37 percent women, while our workforce in the U.S. and Canada was composed of approximately 33 percent people of color.
All managers participated in an unconscious bias learning program, which was a 3 year program completed in 2022, and we hosted several roundtable discussions to learn where we can better support underrepresented talent. Our engagement pulse survey fosters our associate listening strategy, providing routine feedback and meaningful action to drive improvement in our culture and DEI awareness.
Talent Development and Succession
We leverage our MasterBrand Way culture as the foundation for our talent development philosophy by empowering teams to trust the tools and learn from those closest to the work, empower each team member and move forward by equipping our associates with tools to grow and be their best every day. We provide associates the tools to be successful in their current role and help them to develop the skills to build on opportunities to grow their career through career ladders and learning programs. We understand our most critical roles that serve as points of leverage to deliver value and place our best people in those roles, while attracting new talent and capabilities in support of continuous improvement in all we do. We use performance management programs to support a high-performance culture, strengthening our associate engagement and helping to retain our top talent. We provide associates with relevant skills training and provide leadership training for production and distribution associates in a supervisory role and mid-level office associates. We also make a significant investment in assessing our talent against the jobs both in the near term and the future and ensuring our leaders are prepared for greater levels of responsibility and can successfully transition into new roles.
Succession planning for critical roles is an important part of our talent program. Succession and development plans are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along established timelines.
