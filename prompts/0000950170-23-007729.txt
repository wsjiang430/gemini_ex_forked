ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is bezuclastinib (also known as CGT9486), a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to target exon 17 mutations found within the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, including KIT D816V. When KIT D816V remains in a perpetual ‘on’ state it causes mast cells, a type of white blood cell, to accumulate in various internal organs including the bone marrow. This mast cell accumulation results in an orphan disease called Systemic Mastocytosis (“SM”). Exon 17 mutations have also been found in advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (“GIST”), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. Bezuclastinib is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations. In addition to bezuclastinib, the Cogent Research Team is developing a portfolio of novel targeted therapies to help patients fighting serious, genetically driven diseases, and is initially targeting FGFR2 and ErbB2.
 We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, specifically including numerous successful precision medicines for genetically defined diseases. With the support of our board of directors and their expertise, we believe that the Company is well positioned to develop and commercialize novel precision medicines. Beginning with bezuclastinib, our mission is to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products that improve the lives of patients fighting rare, genetically driven diseases.
Our Strategy
Our vision is to discover, develop, and commercialize best-in-class therapies that have a meaningful impact for patients with genetically defined diseases. The principal components of our strategy include:
 •Explore the clinical utility of bezuclastinib in patients with Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“AdvSM”);
 •Explore the clinical utility of bezuclastinib in patients with Non-Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“Non-AdvSM”);
 •Explore the clinical utility of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib in patients with GIST;
 •Prepare to commercialize bezuclastinib should any or all of the planned clinical trials demonstrate clinical benefit for patients with high unmet medical need; 
 •Advance our FGFR2 and ErbB2 preclinical programs, as well as our other undisclosed preclinical programs; and 
 •Discover and develop additional precision medicines for patients with genetically defined diseases.
 

Our Pipeline
    Bezuclastinib Overview
 Bezuclastinib is designed to target mutations within the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, including KIT D816V. As a Type I inhibitor, bezuclastinib is designed to selectively bind the active conformation of mutant KIT. In preclinical studies, bezuclastinib has demonstrated comparable potency relative to other FDA-approved KIT mutant inhibitors, and clear selectivity for KIT mutations versus other kinase targets frequently associated with other KIT inhibitors including, but not limited to, FLT3, VEGFR, PDGFRα and CSF1R. In preclinical studies of bezuclastinib, limited blood-brain-barrier penetration was observed, and there have been no clinically significant CNS toxicities identified either preclinically or clinically. This preclinical profile of selectivity against kinases that have been associated with off-target toxicities and limited blood-brain-barrier penetration differentiate bezuclastinib from other KIT mutant inhibitors, and support the potential for a best-in-class clinical profile. The figures below provide a summary of potency and selectivity preclinical data.

 We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize bezuclastinib from Plexxikon Inc., a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group (“Plexxikon”). Under the terms of the license agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development and regulatory milestone payments along with mid- to high- single-digit royalty payments.
 Bezuclastinib, a potential best-in-class KIT mutant inhibitor, has demonstrated promising clinical activity and safety results in a completed Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with GIST and in an on-going Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with AdvSM, supporting accelerated timelines for further development. In 2021, we initiated three clinical trials designed to explore the safety and efficacy of bezuclastinib in patients with AdvSM, Non-AdvSM and GIST. Currently, all three clinical trials are actively recruiting patients.
 In 2022, we introduced a new formulation of bezuclastinib, which is currently being used in our clinical trial for patients with GIST and which we expect to incorporate into our SM trials in 2023. In 2022, we also filed a provisional patent application seeking to protect the new formulation of bezuclastinib, which could potentially provide exclusivity through at least 2043.
 

Clinical Trials and Disease Overviews
 Bezuclastinib – SM
 SM is driven by KIT D816V mutations causing a perpetual ‘on’ state within mast cells, a type of white blood cell, leading to proliferation and accumulation in various internal organs and bone marrow. Key biomarkers of SM include but are not limited to, elevated serum tryptase, high mass cell burden in bone marrow and the KIT D816V variant allele frequency. As a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor, bezuclastinib has the potential to provide a new treatment option for patients with SM. SM occurs when mast cells inappropriately accumulate in various internal organs in the body. Approximately 90% of patients present with Non-AdvSM and 10% of patients present with AdvSM a rare, very aggressive form of SM. There are three subtypes of AdvSM: aggressive SM (“ASM”), SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (“SM-AHN”) and mast cell leukemia (“MCL”).
 Patients diagnosed with Non-AdvSM, a life-long illness with chronic symptoms including headaches, urticaria pigmentosa, skin lesions, skin redness and warmth (flushing), abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroesophageal reflux (“GERD”), that significantly impact the patient’s quality of life. Many patients are also at high risk for severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to various triggers such as insect bites or stings. Patients with Non-AdvSM suffer from a poor quality of life and without any currently approved therapies, are in need of new treatment options.
Patients with AdvSM may suffer from a multitude of debilitating symptoms such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, ascites, bone fractures, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and enlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, which ultimately lead to organ failure and early death. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years.
Based on the characteristics of bezuclastinib, we are pursuing development of the compound in both patients living with AdvSM and patients with Non-AdvSM, the vast majority of whom have a KIT D816V mutation. Emerging clinical data for other kinase inhibitors with activity against KIT D816V have shown that SM patients are highly sensitive to inhibition of the target. Bezuclastinib was specifically designed to selectively inhibit KIT mutations, including KIT D816V.
 The underlying SM patient population is not yet well understood. The prevalence of SM in the United States is estimated to be up to 30,000 patients, with the prevalence of Non-AdvSM being approximately 25,000 patients. We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for clinically active, well tolerated treatment options for this patient population. We believe bezuclastinib is well suited to meet this need and target the direct underlying cause of SM.
 APEX (AdvSM)
 We are currently enrolling Part 1 of APEX, our global, open-label, multi-center, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with AdvSM evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of bezuclastinib. We expect to provide an update on the planned initiation of APEX Part 2 based on clinical data from approximately 25-30 patients in APEX Part 1 in mid-2023.

Figure 4. APEX study design graphic
 

In December 2022, at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, we reported positive updated clinical data from the ongoing APEX trial. As of the data cutoff date of October 26, 2022, 16 patients had been treated in Part 1 at one of four dose levels (50 mg BID, 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID or 400 mg QD). Eleven patients were evaluable for response per the modified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, and 12 patients were evaluable for response using pure pathological response (PPR) criteria. An objective response rate (ORR) of 89% (including centrally adjudicated confirmed and unconfirmed responses) was achieved in TKI therapy naïve patients, including 67% of patients achieving complete remission (CR), CR with partial hematologic remission (CRh), partial remission (PR) and 22% achieving CR or CRh. An ORR of 73% was achieved in all patients, regardless of prior treatment, and 75% ORR was achieved by PPR criteria, regardless of prior treatment. Additionally, results of key markers of clinical activity were reported from 16 patients.

Figure 6. Platelet counts observed over time in APEX study (Source: ASH conference 2022)
 

As of the cut-off date of October 26, 2022, 14 out of 16 patients treated with bezuclastinib achieved at least a 50% reduction in serum tryptase, with a median reduction of 85%, regardless of prior KIT D816V inhibitor treatment; 13 of 13 patients with at least two cycles of treatment achieved at least a 50 % reduction in bone marrow mast cell aggregates, with 10 of these patients achieving complete clearance of bone marrow mast cell aggregates. Also, 11 of 12 patients with baseline D816V mutation and at least two cycles of treatment achieved at least a 50% reduction in blood KIT D816V variant allele fraction by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Bezuclastinib was generally well-tolerated at all doses. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1/2 and occurred in no more than one patient. Grade 3 events reported as at least possibly related to bezuclastinib were neutropenia (2 patients), thrombocytopenia (1 patient), anemia (1 patient) and hypersensitivity/mediator flare (1 patient). Importantly, there were no related cognitive effects or bleeding events reported, which have been associated with other KIT inhibitors. Limited low-grade edema was observed, and analysis of platelet counts in bezuclastinib-treated patients showed a limited effect of bezuclastinib on platelet counts.

 SUMMIT (Non-AdvSM)
 We are also currently enrolling Part 1 of SUMMIT, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global Phase 2 clinical trial. The study is designed to explore the safety and efficacy of bezuclastinib in patients with moderate to severe Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis (“ISM”) or Smoldering Systemic Mastocytosis (“SSM”), collectively considered as Non-AdvSM. Based on the performance of bezuclastinib’s new formulation in the PEAK lead-in trial, as well as in a healthy normal volunteer study, the SUMMIT trial protocol has been amended to allow for the new formulation to be introduced during the dose optimization phase. We expect to present initial clinical data in patients with Non-AdvSM in the second half of 2023. Clinical data is expected to include safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and measures of clinical activity. The below figure shows the current SUMMIT clinical trial design. In March 2023, Cogent received approvals from European regulatory authorities to initiate the SUMMIT trial in patients with Non-AdvSM. Beginning in April 2023, we expect to start activating clinical trial sites across major countries in the European Union.

Bezuclastinib – GIST
 GIST is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the interstitial cells of the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract. At diagnosis, about 80% of GIST patients’ tumors are the result of primary KIT mutations. Imatinib is the current standard of care for treating GIST patients in the first line setting, with a median PFS of 19 months. However, the majority of GIST patients eventually develop resistance to imatinib due to secondary KIT mutations, most notably in exon 17 and exon 13. There are an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 patients with imatinib-resistant GIST eligible for treatment each year in the United States. We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for clinically active, well tolerated treatment options for this patient population and results from our clinical trial of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib demonstrated the potential for this novel combination to address the underlying drivers of imatinib resistance. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to bezuclastinib for the treatment of GIST.
 Bezuclastinib is designed to be a potent and selective inhibitor of KIT exon 17 mutations. By combining bezuclastinib with sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to inhibit KIT exon 13 mutations, we believe this combination has the potential to offer a new, active treatment option for imatinib resistant GIST patients.
The safety profile of bezuclastinib was clinically evaluated in approximately 50 GIST patients both as a single agent and as part of a combination therapy. Clinical data from this trial were published in the Journal of American Medical Association (“JAMA”) and were presented at several scientific conferences, including most recently by us at the 2020 annual Connective Tissue Oncology Society (“CTOS”) meeting, and previously by Plexxikon at the 2018 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) meeting and the 2017 annual CTOS meeting. In November 2020, we presented final results from a Phase 1/2 trial testing the combination of bezuclastinib with sunitinib in 18 heavily pre-treated GIST patients at 2020 CTOS. In the subset of 15 patients who had not been previously treated with bezuclastinib as a single-agent, the estimated mPFS reached 12 months , the confirmed ORR was 20% and the clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) was 80%, with 27% of patients remaining on therapy out 27-34 months. Importantly, there were no dose limiting toxicities in the three dose levels tested, and the most common Treatment Emergent Adverse Events that were grade 3 or higher included anemia (5 patients, 27.8%), hypophosphatemia (3 patients, 16.7%), diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, and lymphopenia (each 2 patients, 11.1%). Four subjects continued to receive bezuclastinib via individual patient INDs beyond the conclusion of the trial.

PEAK (GIST)
 We are currently enrolling Part 2 of PEAK, our randomized open-label, global Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib compared to sunitinib alone in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib.
 


Figure 11. PEAK study design graphic
 
Based on the data from the PEAK lead-in study we initiated the randomized portion of PEAK using a 600 mg dose of our new formulation of bezuclastinib, supplied as 75 mg tablets, which in the lead-in portion of the study demonstrated clinical exposure comparable to the 1,000 mg original formulation used in our GIST Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Initial safety and pharmacokinetic data from the PEAK lead-in study was presented at the CTOS annual meeting in November 2022. We expect to present updated clinical data from refractory GIST patients in the lead-in cohort of the Phase 3 PEAK trial of bezuclastinib plus sunitinib during the first half of 2023.
 Research Programs
 During the second quarter of 2021, we announced the formation of the Cogent Research Team, a highly experienced discovery and research group. Based in Boulder, Colorado, the Cogent Research Team is focused on pioneering best-in-class, small molecule therapeutics to expand our pipeline and deliver novel precision therapies for patients living with unmet medical needs. Dr. John Robinson, our Chief Scientific Officer, leads the Cogent Research team composed of highly experienced scientists with deep expertise across a broad range of functional specialties including medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, biology, enzymology and pharmacology.
 Our research team is building a pipeline of small molecule inhibitors, with our first efforts aimed toward targeting currently undrugged mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (“FGFR”). FGFR mutations are well-established oncogenic drivers in multiple diseases, but approved medicines fail to capture the full landscape of FGFR altered tumor types, with FGFR1-mediated hyperphosphatemia serving as the most common dose-limiting toxicity for pan-FGFR inhibitors. In October 2022, we reported preclinical data at EORTC-NCI-AACR (“ENA”) annual meeting on a next-generation fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (“FGFR2”) program, which retains potency across all primary, gatekeeper and molecular brake resistance mutations, including N549K and V564I, while sparing FGFR1 inhibition.
Our research team is also advancing a novel, ErbB2 mutant program, which is focused on actionable and underserved mutations in a variety of solid tumor indications. Currently available oral ErbB2 inhibitors struggle to provide broad mutant coverage while sparing EGFR activity. In October 2022, presented preclinical data at ENA on a novel ErbB2 mutant selective program which demonstrates robust cellular inhibition of all key resistance and primary driver mutations, including L755S, V842I and S310F/Y, while sparing wild type EGFR target engagement.
 For both FGFR and ErBB2, we see an opportunity to provide a more robust molecular response compared to existing therapies. We expect to initiate clinical trials for both of these programs in 2024.
Intellectual Property
One key to our success will be our ability to establish and maintain protection for our product candidates and know-how, in order to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing on the rights of others. We rely on our know-how, trade secrets and continuing technological innovation as well as on in-licensing of third-party intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Our patent portfolio consists of U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications that we in-licensed exclusively from Plexxikon, as well as additional patent applications we have filed on our own.
 With the acquisition of Kiq Bio LLC (formerly Kiq LLC) (“Kiq”) on July 6, 2020, we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to patents and applications owned by Plexxikon pursuant to a license agreement between Plexxikon and Kiq (the “License Agreement”). The licensed patents and applications under the License Agreement cover bezuclastinib, its therapeutic uses, and methods of making bezuclastinib and intermediates. These patents and applications include issued patents in multiple territories, including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Europe (validated in Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, as well as various other EU countries), Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, and the United States. The pending applications also include patent applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, and the United States. The issued U.S. patents covering bezuclastinib and its therapeutic uses are expected to expire in 2033 and 2034, and the issued foreign patents covering bezuclastinib and its therapeutic uses are expected to expire in 2033, without consideration of potential patent term extensions. Patent applications covering methods of making bezuclastinib and intermediates could potentially provide exclusivity through at least 2041. In 2022, we filed a provisional patent application seeking to protect our new formulation of bezuclastinib, which could potentially provide exclusivity through at least 2043.We may seek to obtain rights under additional patent applications relating to bezuclastinib and its use to treat SM and GIST in the United States and in other countries as we proceed with this development program.
We are not currently a party to and have not been a party to any legal proceedings involving patent rights.
In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by trade secret and confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States.
In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Moreover, we may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property. Disputes regarding ownership or inventorship of our patents or other intellectual property can arise in various contexts, including collaborations and sponsored research. If we are subject to a dispute challenging our rights in or to patents or other intellectual property, such a dispute could be expensive and time consuming. If we are unsuccessful, we could lose valuable rights in intellectual property that we regard as our own.
 For more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 

Licenses and Third-Party Research Collaborations
License Agreement with Plexxikon Inc.
 In July 2020, we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to research, develop, and commercialize bezuclastinib. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we are required to pay Plexxikon aggregate payments of up to $7.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones and up to $25.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain regulatory milestones. During the second quarter of 2022, as a result of the progression of the PEAK study, the first clinical milestone was achieved, resulting in payment of $2.5 million to Plexxikon in June 2022. As of December 31, 2022, no other milestone payments have been made or are considered probable of occurring.
 We are also required to pay Plexxikon tiered royalties ranging from a low-single digit percentage to a high-single digit percentage on annual net sales of products. These royalty obligations last on a product-by-product basis and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the date on which there is no valid claim of a licensed Plexxikon patent covering a subject product in such country or (ii) the 10th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. In addition, if we sublicense the rights under the License Agreement, we are required to pay a certain percentage of the sublicense revenue to Plexxikon ranging from mid-double digit percentages to mid-single digit percentages, depending on whether the sublicense is entered into prior to or after certain development and regulatory milestones.
The License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of the last to expire of the patents covering such licensed products or services or the 10-year anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. Plexxikon may terminate the License Agreement within 30 days after written notice in the event of a breach of contract that remains uncured. Plexxikon may also terminate the agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, or insolvency. In addition, we have the right to terminate the License Agreement in its entirety at will upon 90 days’ advance written notice to Plexxikon.
 Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that address precision medicines for patients with genetically defined diseases. There are several other companies working to develop therapies in this field using a similar strategy. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any drugs that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.


Bezuclastinib, if approved for the indications for which we are currently enrolling clinical trials, will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs that are currently in development.
 In SM, the only approved drugs for the treatment of AdvSM are Blueprint Medicines Corporation’s ("Blueprint") avapritinib and Novartis AG’s midostaurin. Additionally, Novartis AG’s imatinib is approved for AdvSM patients without the KIT D816V mutation or mutational status unknown. There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of Non-AdvSM. The most advanced drug candidate for the treatment of Non-AdvSM is Blueprint’s avapritinib, for which Blueprint has submitted a supplement new drug application to the FDA and has a PDUFA date of May 22, 2023. We may also face competition from other drug candidates in pre-clinical or clinical development for SM.
In GIST, the current approved standards of care for unresectable or metastatic patients are first-line imatinib, followed by second-line sunitinib upon imatinib progression, followed by third-line regorafenib upon sunitinib progression, followed by fourth-line ripretinib for patients who have received three or more prior kinase inhibitors. In addition, avapritinib was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for patients with GIST harboring a PDGFRα exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations only. We may face competition from other drug candidates in pre-clinical or clinical development including, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Xencor, Inc., Theseus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and IDRx.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and have no current plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for future commercial supply of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained API and drug product from third-party manufacturers for bezuclastinib to support preclinical and clinical testing. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase-order basis and do not have any long-term supply arrangements. We do not currently have a validated manufacturing process in place for any product candidate which would be required to support commercialization of any of our drug candidates, if approved.
 Our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured from readily available starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. The manufacturing process is amenable to scale-up. As we continue our clinical development of bezuclastinib, we expect to continue to enhance our manufacturing process to allow for drug candidates that are safer, more effective, have superior dosing regimens and are cost-effective.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, product approval, manufacture, quality control, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, marketing, and import and export of drugs and biologic products. Our current product candidates are expected to be regulated as drugs. The processes for obtaining regulatory approval in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities both pre- and post-commercialization, are a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our research and development activities and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA and other government entities regulate drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the United States at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, issuance of warning letters and other types of regulatory letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, refusals of or debarment from government contracts, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil or criminal investigations by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, State Attorneys General, and/or other agencies, False Claims Act suits and/or other litigation, and/or criminal prosecutions.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 •completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective without FDA objection before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations, to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for each indication for which approval is sought;
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA;
 •satisfactory review of the NDA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient or ingredients thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
 •payment of user fees, as applicable, and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, such as any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, or post-approval studies required by the FDA.
 

Preclinical Studies and an IND
 Preclinical studies can include in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Other studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity, stability and physical form of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the physical properties, stability and reproducibility of the formulated drug or drug product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing, such as longer-term toxicity testing, animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites in late-stage clinical trials to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently $2.876 million for fiscal year 2021, for applications requiring clinical data, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently $336,432 for fiscal year 2021. These fees are adjusted annually.
 Under certain circumstances, the FDA will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business, defined as a company with less than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, submits for review. An affiliate is defined as a business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity if one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity, or a third-party controls, or has the power to control, both entities. In addition, an application to market a prescription drug product that has received orphan designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or for which there is no reasonable expectation that U.S. sales will be sufficient to recoup the development and production costs.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 

The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. After approval, the FDA may seek to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. Some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of Fast Track Designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 The FDA may approve an NDA under the accelerated approval program if the drug treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, established the Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 

Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
 FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant criminal and civil liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 •the required patent information has not been filed;
 •the listed patent has expired;
 •the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
 •the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Legislative Developments
 The 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, includes provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments. For example, the Cures Act requires the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, to issue guidance on adaptive and novel clinical trial designs for new drugs, and to establish a process for qualifying drug development tools used to support FDA approval for marketing or investigational use of a drug. The Cures Act also permits the FDA to rely on qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application for an already approved drug. The FDA is in the process of implementing the Cures Act requirements.
 

Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 In order to market any pharmaceutical product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, clinical trials, marketing authorization, packaging, storage, record keeping, reporting, export and import, advertising, marketing and other promotional practices involving pharmaceutical products, as well as commercial sales, distribution, authorization, approval and post-approval monitoring and reporting of our products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a pharmaceutical product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the pharmaceutical product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Drug Development Process
 The conduct of clinical trials is currently governed by the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or Clinical Trials Directive, and will be replaced by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (“CTR”) once the latter comes into effect. The CTR introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. It entered into force on January 31, 2022. Under the current regime, which will expire after a transition period of one or three years, respectively, as outlined below in more detail, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted. The approval must be obtained from two separate entities: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”) and one or more Ethics Committees. The NCA of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member State before the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant NCA and Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member State where they occur.
 A more unified procedure will apply under the new CTR. A sponsor will be able to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial from being conducted in such Member State. The CTR also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. Member States will work in CTIS immediately after the system has gone live. For one year, until 31 January 2023, clinical trial sponsors can still choose whether to submit an initial clinical trial application in line with the current system (Clinical Trials Directive) or via CTIS. From 31 January 2023, submission of initial clinical trial applications via CTIS becomes mandatory, and by 31 January 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the current Clinical Trials Directive will be governed by the new Regulation and have to be transitioned to CTIS.
 Under both the current regime and the new CTR, national laws, regulations, and the applicable Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (“GCP)” and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 

During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medical Agency (“EMA”) and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party (“SAWP”). A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure, but is significantly reduced for designated orphan medicines. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) of the product concerned.
 Marketing Authorization Procedures
 In the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (together the European Economic Area or “EEA”), after completion of all required clinical testing, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). To obtain an MA of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant can submit an MAA through, amongst others, a centralized or decentralized procedure.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission (EC) that is valid for all EU Member States and, after respective national implementing decisions, in the three additional EEA Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific medicinal products, including for medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMP”) and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto- immune and viral diseases). For medicinal products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA before May 20, 2004 and indicated for the treatment of other diseases, medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations or for which the grant of a MA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at EU level, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a marketing authorization through the centralized procedure.
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), established at the EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure, the timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA’s CHMP is, in principle, 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more, unless the application is eligible for an accelerated assessment. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. On request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment. The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. However, the EC has final authority for granting the MA within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion.
The decentralized procedure permits companies to file identical MA applications for a medicinal product to the competent authorities in various EU Member States simultaneously if such medicinal product has not received marketing approval in any EU Member State before. This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference EU Member State and concerned EU Member States. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Subsequently each concerned EU Member State must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 If an EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding for all EU Member States.
 All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. RMPs and Periodic Safety Update Reports (“PSURs”) are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.


Marketing Authorizations have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may subsequently be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with only one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
 Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
 As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (even if the pharmaceutical product has already received a MA) and prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market. New Chemical Entities (“NCE”) approved in the EU qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity.
 An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies.
 The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first MA in the EU. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the MA holder’s data. However, a generic product cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product) if the MA holder obtains MA for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. Additionally, another noncumulative one -year period of data exclusivity can be added to the eight years of data exclusivity where an application is made for a new indication for a well-established substance, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication. Another year of data exclusivity may be added to the eight years, where a change of classification of a pharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials (when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance the competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year after the initial chance was authorized).
 Products may not be granted data exclusivity since there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to include a NCE. Even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the MA applicant is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the medicinal product if such company can complete a full MAA with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain MA of its product.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. The EMA grants orphan drug designation if the medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union (prevalence criterion). In addition, Orphan Drug Designation can be granted if, for economic reasons, the medicinal product would be unlikely to be developed without incentives and if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed medicinal product is a significant benefit to patients affected by the condition. An application for orphan drug designation (which is not a marketing authorization, as not all orphan-designated medicines reach the authorization application stage) must be submitted first before an application for marketing authorization of the medicinal product is submitted. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted, and sponsors must submit an annual report to EMA summarizing the status of development of the medicine. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Designated orphan medicines are eligible for conditional marketing authorization.


The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products reassesses the orphan drug designation of a product in parallel with the review for a marketing authorization; for a product to benefit from market exclusivity it must maintain its orphan drug designation at the time of marketing authorization review by the EMA and approval by the EC. Additionally, any marketing authorization granted for an orphan medicinal product must only cover the therapeutic indication(s) that are covered by the orphan drug designation. Upon the grant of a marketing authorization, orphan drug designation provides up to ten years of market exclusivity in the orphan indication.
 During the 10-year period of market exclusivity, with a limited number of exceptions, the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States and the EMA may not accept applications for marketing authorization, accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity for an orphan-designated condition when the results of specific studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”), addressing the pediatric population and completed in accordance with a fully compliant Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”). No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, i.e. the condition prevalence or financial returns criteria under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. When the period of orphan market exclusivity for an indication ends, the orphan drug designation for that indication expires as well. Orphan exclusivity runs in parallel with normal rules on data exclusivity and market protection. Additionally, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product (orphan or not) for the same or overlapping indication subject to certain requirements.
Pediatric Development
 In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product are obligated to study their product in children and must therefore submit a PIP together with a request for agreement to the EMA. The EMA issues a decision on the PIP based on an opinion of the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. Companies must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with the PIP approved by the EMA, unless a deferral (e.g., until enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults is available) or waiver (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults) has been granted by the EMA. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of all pediatric clinical trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with the approved PIP, unless a waiver or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials may be completed at a later date. Medical products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the approved PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the approved PIP are developed and submitted. An approved PIP is also required when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the EC and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practices rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of medicinal products.
 Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of the individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of pharmaceutical products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 

The holder of a MA for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products.
 These pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of MAs the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed medicinal products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine’s safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability. MA holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of PSURs in relation to medicinal products for which they hold MAs. The EMA reviews PSURs for medicinal products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the riskbenefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing MA for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The agency can advise that the MA holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. If the EC agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing MA. Failure by the MA holder to fulfill the obligations for which the EC’s decision provides can undermine the ongoing validity of the MA.
More generally, non-compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the MA for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
 The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the European Union is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”). These requirements include compliance with EU GMP standards when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union.
 Similarly, the distribution of pharmaceutical products into and within the European Union is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP, before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the European Union or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP.
 Advertising and Promotion
 The advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other national legislation of individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products and may differ from one country to another. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s SmPC as approved by the competent regulatory authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Pricing and Reimbursement Environment
 Even if a pharmaceutical product obtains a marketing authorization in the European Union, there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.
 Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, if any, to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, pharmaceutical products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally published and actual prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third party payers or authorities and public tenders may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.
 The so-called health technology assessment (“HTA”), of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and societal impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost- effectiveness of individual pharmaceutical products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of pharmaceutical products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of our products by a leading and recognized HTA body could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific pharmaceutical product.
 

On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technology assessment. This legislative proposal is intended to boost EU level cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new pharmaceutical products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the European Union, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. While EU Member States could choose to delay participation in the joint work until three years after the rules enter into force, it will become mandatory after six years. The European Commission has stated that the role of the HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States, but there can be no assurance that the HTA regulation will not have effects on pricing and reimbursement decisions. The HTA entered into force on January 11, 2022 and applies as of January 2025 followed by a further three-year transitional period during which EU member states must fully adapt to the new system.
 To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, including the EU Member States, we may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any country will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of our products, or that we will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.
 In certain of the EU Member States, pharmaceutical products that are designated as orphan pharmaceutical products may be exempted or waived from having to provide certain clinical, cost-effectiveness and other economic data in connection with their filings for pricing/reimbursement approval.
 European Data Laws
 The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”), which came into force in May 2018 and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States.
The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (processing includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data of individuals within the European Union and in the EEA, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of certain data processing activities to the national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. EU Member States may also impose additional requirements in relation to health, genetic and biometric data through their national implementing legislation.
 Under the GDPR, personal data can only be transferred within the EU Member States and the three additional European Economic Area countries (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) that have adopted a national law implementing the GDPR. Appropriate safeguards are required to enable cross-border transfers of personal data from the EU and EEA Member States to a “third country” (a country outside the EU or EEA). This status has a number of significant practical consequences, in particular for international data transfers, competent supervisory authorities and enforcement of the GDPR.
 

In conclusion, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Union/EEA (including the United States) that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, except if the data importer meets very specific requirements such as the use of standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”), issued by the European Commission. In this respect recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EU/EEA. For example, on June 4, 2021 the EU Commission issued a new set of SCCs for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA. These SCCs replace the old sets of SCCs that were adopted under the previous European Data Protection Directive 95/46. There were various implementation deadlines linked to the use of these new SCCs, and all contracts incorporating SCCs had to be updated to include the new SCCs by December 27, 2022. On November 11, 2021, the European Data Protection Board has adopted recommendations on such appropriate safeguards that supplement transfer mechanisms (like the SCCs). These recommendations aim to assist data exporters with their duty to identify and implement appropriate supplementary measures where they are needed to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection to the personal data they transfer to third countries. However, the European Commission published a set of Questions and Answers on May 25, 2022 which provides that the new 2021 SCCs do not work for data importers whose processing operations are subject to the GDPR as they would duplicate, and in part deviate from, obligations that already follow directly from the GDPR. The Commission indicated that it is in the processing of developing an additional set of SCCs for this scenario. This has created a situation where very limited transfer mechanisms exist for use by data importers in third countries such as the United States.
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, other administrative penalties and a number of criminal offenses (punishable by uncapped fines) for organizations and in certain cases their directors and officers as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union. Guidance developed at both EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
 There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the European Union which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU CTR, EMA disclosure initiatives and voluntary commitments by industry. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation and the GDPR, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.
 On June 28, 2021 the European Commission adopted two adequacy decisions for the United Kingdom – one under the GDPR and the other for the Law Enforcement Directive. Personal data may now freely flow from the European Union to the United Kingdom since the United Kingdom is deemed to have an adequate data protection level. Additionally, following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union and the EEA, companies also have to comply with the UK’s data protection laws (including the UK GDPR, which is based on the EU GDPR), which has the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The adequacy decisions include a ‘sunset clause’ which entails that the decisions will automatically expire four years after their entry into force.
 Promotional Activities
 In the European Union, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct both at EU level and in the individual EU Member States (at a national or regional level). The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 

Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States (at a national or regional level). Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, exclusion from public tenders, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 While the UK has left the EU, as mentioned above, it should be noted that the UK still has the strictest anti-bribery regime in Europe, the UK Bribery Act 2010. The Act is applicable English law and continues to apply to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the United Kingdom, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs.
 Other Legislation Regarding Marketing, Authorization and Pricing of Pharmaceutical Products in the European Union
  Other core legislation relating to the marketing, authorization and pricing of pharmaceutical products in the European Union includes the following:
 •Directive 2001/83/EC, establishing the requirements and procedures governing the marketing authorization for medicinal products for human use, as well as the rules for the constant supervision of products following authorization. This Directive has been amended several times, most recently by Directive 2012/26/EU regarding pharmacovigilance, and the Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62/EU.
 •Regulation (EC) 726/2004, as amended, establishing procedures for the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing the EMA.
 •Regulation (EC) 469/2009, establishing the requirements necessary to obtain a Supplementary Protection Certificate, which extends the period of patent protection applicable to medicinal products at the EU-level.
 •Directive 89/105/EEC, ensuring the transparency of measures taken by the European Union member states to set the prices and reimbursements of medicinal products. Specifically, while each member state has competence over the pricing and reimbursement of medicines for human use, they must also comply with this Directive, which establishes procedures to ensure that member state decisions and policies do not obstruct trade in medicinal products. The European Commission proposed to repeal and replace Directive 89/105/EEC, but this proposal was withdrawn in 2015.
 •Directive 2003/94/EC, laying down the principles of good manufacturing practice in respect of medicinal products and investigational medicinal products for human use (the GMP Directive).
 •Directive 2005/28/EC of April 8 2005, laying down principles and detailed guidelines for good clinical practice as regards investigational medicinal products for human use, as well as the requirements for authorization of the manufacturing or importation of such products (the GCP Directive).
 

New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the European Union, its member states and other states of Europe that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. In addition to new legislation, pharmaceutical regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the EMA and national agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
 The United Kingdom (“UK”) formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and the transition period, during which EU laws continued to apply to the UK, expired on December 31, 2020. This means EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Following the end of the transition period, the EU and the UK concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (“TCA”), which applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021.
 The TCA includes provisions affecting the life sciences sector (including on customs and tariffs) but areas for further discussion between the EU and the UK remain. In addition, there are some specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals. These include the mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) and issued GMP documents. The TCA does not, however, contain wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations and product standards.
 Since January 1, 2021, the EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable in the UK as “retained EU law”. As there is no general power to amend these regulations, the UK government has enacted the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021. The purpose of the act is to enable the existing regulatory frameworks in relation to human medicines, clinical trials of human medicines, veterinary medicines and medical devices to be updated. The powers under the act may only be exercised in relation to specified matters and must safeguard public health.
Specified provisions of the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 entered into force on February 11, 2021. The remaining provisions came into effect within two months of February 11, 2021 or will otherwise come into effect as stipulated in subsequent statutory instruments. The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 supplements the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (“UK Regulations”), which are based on the EU Medical Devices Directive as amended to reflect the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime. Notably, the UK Regulations do not include any of the revisions that have been made by the EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745, which, since May 26, 2021, now applies in all EU Member States.
The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) conducted a comprehensive consultation between September and November 2021 on proposals to develop a new UK regime for medical devices in the UK. The proposals include more closely aligning definitions for medical devices and in vitro medical devices with internationally recognised definitions and changing the classification of medical devices according to levels or risk. The proposals are intended to improve patient and public safety and increase the appeal of the UK market. The new regime is planned to come into force on July 1, 2023, which will align with the date from which the UK is due to stop accepting CE marked medical devices and require UKCA (“UK Conformity Assessed”) marking. It is envisaged that, in Northern Ireland, the amended regime could run in parallel with any existing or future EU rules in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.
 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as, in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not necessarily imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs, which may impact physician utilization.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, risk sharing, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
 In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs.
 Since its enactment, there have been continual judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. It is unclear how these efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify the ACA will impact the law on reimbursement. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, particularly as a result of the recent presidential election, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert

competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
 •the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (in cash or in kind), directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any item, facility or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation;
 •the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits, among other things, U.S. corporations and persons acting on their behalf from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official (including certain healthcare professionals in many countries), political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or otherwise seek preferential treatment abroad;
 •the federal False Claims Act, which may be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice or private whistleblowers to bring civil actions (qui tam actions) on behalf of the federal government, imposes civil penalties, as well as liability for treble damages and for attorneys’ fees and costs, on individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, making a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
 •the Department of Health and Human Services’ Civil Monetary Penalties authorities, which imposes administrative sanctions for, among other things, presenting or causing to be presented false claims for government payment and providing remuneration to government health program beneficiaries to influence them to order or receive healthcare items or services;
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other conduct, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes criminal and civil liability and penalties on those who violate requirements, including mandatory contractual terms, intended to safeguard the privacy, security, transmission and use of individually identifiable health information;
 •the federal false statements statute relating to healthcare matters prohibits falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
 •the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs (among other products) to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined by statute) and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the reporting manufacturers. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report payments and other transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year;


•similar state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and
 •certain state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with voluntary compliance guidelines promulgated by a pharmaceutical industry association and relevant compliance guidance issues by HHS Office of Inspector General; bar drug manufacturers from offering or providing certain types of payments or gifts to physicians and other health care providers; and/or require disclosure of gifts or payments to physicians and other healthcare providers.
 Various state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances; many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violation of any of these laws or any other current or future governmental laws and regulations that may apply to drug manufacturers include significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if the manufacturer becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, any of which could substantially disrupt its operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
 Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state, and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling, and disposal of various biologic, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in third countries that impose similar obligations.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 138 employees, approximately 62% of whom have an M.D., Ph.D., or other advanced degree. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain a diverse group of highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March 2014 under the name Unum Therapeutics Inc. On April 3, 2018, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock under the ticker “UMRX.” On October 2, 2020, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to change our name to Cogent Biosciences, Inc. The name change became effective on October 6, 2020. In connection with the name change, our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “COGT.”
As of December 31, 2022, we had 90,761,994 shares outstanding on a fully diluted and as-converted basis, including the 69,893,434 shares of common stock outstanding, the 606,060 pre-funded warrants that are exercisable for shares of common stock, and the 81,050 shares of Series A Preferred stock, which are convertible into 20,262,500 shares of common stock.
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
•only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
 •reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
 •no non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
 •exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. We have taken advantage of the reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.
We have irrevocably elected to “opt out” of the exemption for the delayed adoption of certain accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
