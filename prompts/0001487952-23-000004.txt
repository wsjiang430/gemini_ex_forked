Item 1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
General
Vishay Precision Group, Inc. (“VPG,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a global, diversified company focused on precision measurement and sensing technologies that help power the future by bridging the physical world with the digital one. Many of our specialized sensors, weighing solutions, and measurement systems are “designed-in” by our customers, and address growing applications across a diverse array of industries and markets. Our products are marketed under brand names that we believe are characterized as having a very high level of precision and quality, and we employ an operationally diversified structure to manage our businesses. 
Driven by the continued proliferation of data generated by the expanding use of sensors across a widening array of industrial and non-industrial applications, precision measurement and sensing technologies help ensure and deliver required levels of quality of mission-critical or high-value data. VPG’s products are often at the first stage of a data value chain (i.e., the process of converting the physical world into a digital format that can be used for a specific purpose) and as such impact the effectiveness of vast number of critical, high-value downstream processes. Over the past few years, we have seen a broadening of precision sensing applications in both our traditional industrial markets and new markets, due to the development of higher functionality in our customers' end products. Our precision measurement solutions are used across a wide variety of end markets upon which we focus, including industrial, test and measurement, transportation, steel, medical, agriculture, avionics, military and space, and consumer product applications. The Company has a long heritage of innovation in sensor technologies that provide accuracy, reliability and repeatability that make our customers' products safer, smarter, and more productive. As the functionality of customers products continues to increase, and they integrate more precision measurement sensors and related systems into their solutions, we believe this will offer substantial growth opportunities for our products and expertise. 
Our History
On July 6, 2010, our company was spun off by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (“Vishay Intertechnology”) through a tax-free stock dividend of VPG stock to Vishay Intertechnology’s stockholders, and we became a publicly-traded company. Vishay Intertechnology was founded in 1962 by Dr. Felix Zandman to develop and manufacture the first generation of Bulk Metal® foil resistors and later, foil strain gages. Shortly after its founding, Vishay Intertechnology established itself as a technical and market leader in precision foil resistors, and foil strain gages. These innovations were the genesis of the products and technology that provide a unique strategic competitive advantage for VPG, as these products were transitioned to VPG from Vishay Intertechnology as part of the spin off.
In the decade prior to the spin-off, Vishay Intertechnology expanded our sensor and measurement business through acquisitions, extending our business from its initial focus on precision foil resistors and foil strain gages to include an array of load cell-based solutions. 
Since becoming an independent company, we have made several acquisitions that have added to our strong, diverse, global manufacturing, sales and distribution network, which includes facilities in Canada, People's Republic of China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Sweden, Republic of China (Taiwan), the United Kingdom, and the United States.
We were incorporated in Delaware on August 28, 2009. Our principal executive offices are located at 3 Great Valley Parkway, Suite 150, Malvern, PA 19355. Our main telephone number is 484-321-5300.
Key Business Vision and Strategies
Our vision is to be a leading provider of precision measurement and sensing technologies, which include sensors, weighing solutions and measurement systems that deliver accuracy, reliability and repeatability that make our customers' products safer, smarter, and more productive. VPG delivers in-depth, deep engineering expertise to the design and manufacture of non-commodity sensors, weighing solutions and precision measurement systems that optimize and enhance our customers’ solutions performance across a broad array of end markets.
Our strategy is to leverage our core technologies and competitive positions in our home markets, establishing an accelerated organic growth, as well as by acquiring complementary precision measurement sensing products. Specifically, we are focused on the following strategic initiatives:
- 3 -


Operationally Diversified
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we formally adopted an operationally diversified structure and strategy, through which each of VPG's business segments maintains and deploys distinct go-to-market strategies, technical expertise, capital requirements, and acquisition opportunities. We use an operationally diversified strategy and structure to be close to our customers and to leverage our high-level engineering expertise to optimize and enhance the performance of our customers' solutions. We seek to maximize the performance and value of our businesses by leveraging our accumulated experience, methodologies, and expertise in driving operational excellence across our functional areas, as well as in the allocation of capital and investment. 
Optimize Core Competence
The Company’s core competencies include our innovative deep technical and applications-specific expertise to add value to our customers' products, our strong brands and customer relationships, our focus on operational excellence, our ability to select and develop our management teams, and our proven M&A strategy. We continue to optimize all aspects of our development, manufacturing and sales processes, including by increasing our technical sales efforts; continuing to innovate in product performance and design; and refining our manufacturing processes. 
Our Sensors segment research group developed innovations that enhance the capability and performance of our strain gages, while simultaneously reducing their size and power consumption as part of our advanced sensors product line. We believe this unique foil technology will create new markets as customers “design in” these next generation products in existing and new applications. Our development engineering team is also responsible for creating new processes to further automate manufacturing, and improve productivity and quality. Our advanced sensors manufacturing technology also offers us the capability to produce high-quality foil strain gages in a highly automated environment, which we believe results in reduced manufacturing and lead times, improved quality and increased margins. As a sign of our commitment to these businesses, we signed a long-term lease for a state-of-the-art facility that has been constructed in Israel. We fully transitioned to this facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
We also seek to achieve significant production cost savings through the transfer, expansion, and construction of manufacturing operations in countries such as India, Japan, and Israel, where we can benefit from improved efficiencies or available tax and other government-sponsored incentives. In the past several years, we incurred restructuring expense related to closing and downsizing of facilities as part of the manufacturing transitions of our load cell products to facilities in India and China, which marked key milestones in our ongoing strategic initiatives to align and consolidate our manufacturing footprint. 
Organic Growth
Our product portfolio is focused, to a significant extent, on specialty products serving niche markets. The development of specialty products requires us to form long-term relationships with our customers. Our specialty products are usually designed, or engineered, to meet unique specifications for OEMs. This often results in our customers creating a non-standard part number used solely to designate our product on their bill of materials. We call this customer activity a “design win.” This activity may create organic growth as the OEM customer begins to order increasing quantities to meet their production requirements, with little or no opportunity to purchase a similar part from competing suppliers. The “design in” time for these initiatives is typically 12 to 24 months.
We expect to continue to use our research and development, engineering, and product marketing resources to introduce new and innovative specialty products. An example of our success in this regard is the recent acceptance and growth of our on-board vehicle weighing solution incorporating microelectromechanical systems ("MEMS") technology. Our ability to react to changing customer needs, emerging markets, and industry trends will continue to be a key to our success.
Our design, research, and product development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations to market. We intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop and roll out new, innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends in terms of form, fit, and function. 
Growth from Acquisitions
We expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions where opportunities present themselves to grow and expand our segments. Historically, our growth and acquisition strategy had been largely focused on vertical product integration, using our foil strain gages in our load cell products, and incorporating those products into our weighing solutions. In recent years, we widened our acquisition strategy to include a broader set of precision measurement systems and product companies.

In 2013, we completed our first acquisition as an independent public company when we acquired substantially all of the assets of the George Kelk Corporation ("KELK"). KELK engineers, designs and manufactures highly accurate optical and electronic roll force measurement and control equipment primarily used by metals rolling mills and mining applications throughout the world.
On December 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Stress-Tek, Inc. ("Stress-Tek") based in Kent, Washington. Stress-Tek designs and manufactures state-of-the-art, rugged and reliable strain gage-based load cells and force measurement systems. Stress-Tek primarily operates in North America, where their sensors and display systems are used in a wide range of industries, predominantly in transportation and trucking, for timber, refuse, aggregate, mining, and general trucking applications. 
On April 6, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Pacific Instruments, Inc. ("Pacific Instruments") based in Concord, California. Pacific Instruments designs and manufactures high-performance signal conditioning, data acquisition and control systems and has extensive experience integrating these systems. Pacific Instruments sells primarily to the aerospace, commercial aviation and defense markets in the United States. 
On November 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of New York-based Dynamic Systems Inc. ("DSI"), a provider of specialized dynamic thermal-mechanical test and simulation systems used to develop new metal alloys and optimize production processes. DSI is an established, high margin business, with a strong brand and has the largest installed base of products of its type in the world, according to market estimates. DSI expands our position in the steel market and offers opportunities for growth by leveraging our sales capabilities and market presence, and by expanding DSI’s product line to address new opportunities. 
On June 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of California-based Diversified Technical Systems, Inc. (“DTS”), a leading manufacturer of data acquisition systems and sensors for product and safety testing. DTS's embedded data acquisition and data logging products expands our offerings to the automotive and avionics, military, and space markets. We believe DTS will continue to benefit from the global need for specialized safety testing that is expanding from the automotive and avionics sectors to sports applications. As a result of our acquisition, we acquired a leased manufacturing, engineering, sales and administrative facility in Seal Beach, California. 
We expect to expand our expertise, and our acquisition focus, outside our traditional vertical approach to other precision measurement solutions, including in the fields of measurement of force, weight, pressure, torque, tilt, motion, and acceleration. We believe acquired businesses will benefit from improvements we implement to reduce redundant functions and from our current global manufacturing and distribution footprint. 
Leverage Global Brand
While our acquisitions provided us an array of strong brand names, in addition to our historical resistor and strain gage brands, we believe the continued success of our strategy is best served by the establishment of a strong overall global brand. The “VPG” brand leverages the strength of these historical brands under the umbrella of a unified, globally recognizable VPG name. We continue to broaden and emphasize the VPG brand in the markets we serve under the following brands for each of our business segments:

Sensors | Weighing Solutions | Measurement Systems 
VPG Foil Resistors | VPG Transducers | KELK 
- VFR | - Celtron | Dynamic Systems Inc. or Gleeble

Business Segments and Products
Each of VPG's business segments maintains and deploys specific go-to-market strategies, technical expertise, capital requirements, and acquisition opportunities, which are in line with our operationally diversified structure and strategy. VPG reports in three product segments: Sensors, Weighing Solutions, and Measurement Systems.
Sensors
The Sensors segment is comprised of our precision resistor and strain gage businesses. Precision resistor products offer superior precision, stability, and reliability. Our resistor portfolio encompasses a wide variety of configurations and packages designed to meet the requirements of even the most demanding applications. 
Precision resistors are the most precise and stable type of resistors currently available. Resistors are basic components used in all forms of electronic circuitry to adjust and regulate levels of voltage and current. Our current sense resistors were developed with a low absolute TCR and Kelvin connections to meet the demand of stable resistive products.
Our precision resistors are based on Bulk Metal Foil® technology and are used in diverse applications, which require a high degree of precision and stability. The main market segments for our precision resistors are as follows: Avionics & Military, Space Communications, Fiber Optics, Industrial Automation, EV Battery Management Infrastructure, and Precision Weighing, Test & Measurements / Semiconductors and others. Foil resistors are marketed under four different brands: VFR, Alpha Electronics, Powertron and APR. APR is our off the shelf commercial product line based on AEC-Q200 standardization. To complement our extensive portfolio of high-performance precision resistors, we also offer decade boxes, standard resistors, exceptional precision thin film and power resistors including special construction configurations to meet the requirements of high temperature applications. We have a road map of new technology products to meet the required needs of our customers.
Our strain gage products, which include our advanced sensors, are resistive sensors that are attached to the surface of an object to determine the surface strain caused by an applied force. Marketed under the well-known Micro-Measurements brand, our strain gages are used for OEM and in stress analysis applications for structural testing in the aviation, military and space, infrastructure, and construction markets, along with force measurement and weighing markets. Typical applications of strain gages include test and measurement applications where the strength of the object is the main consideration and the object under test is a structural component in a machine or device, such as an automobile, an aircraft, or a highway bridge. Strain gages are also used inside precision transducers where the magnitude of an applied force is the focus of the measurement. Using strain gages attached to metal components, a variety of physical measurements can be made including force, weight, pressure, displacement, and acceleration. Our innovative advanced sensors product line enhances the capability and performance of our strain gages, while simultaneously reducing their size and power consumption. 
A portion of our strain gage products are sold to third parties as “standard catalog items”, while the remainder of these products are sold as non-standard and/or custom products to third parties and to our Weighing Solutions segment. Strain gage products are sold across several of our market sectors, with a significant portion being sold to consumer end markets. 
The products in the Sensors segment are primarily based on our resistive foil technology, which continues to evolve and enables many products in both segments to be suited for new and varied applications. 
The manufacturing of the foil material is a critical and common component of the Company’s strain gage and precision foil resistor operating segments, and as a result, we experience synergies between our precision resistor and strain gage operating segments. The production cycles for precision resistors and strain gages are similar and many of the same raw materials are utilized in the manufacturing processes for both operating segments. The foil resistor and strain gage products require a similar level of labor and capital. However, the advanced sensors’ manufacturing technology offers us the capability to produce high-quality foil strain gages in a highly automated environment, which we believe results in reduced manufacturing costs and lead times, higher quality, and increased margins. 
Weighing Solutions
The Weighing Solutions segment is comprised of our VPG Transducers, VPG Onboard Weighing, BLH Nobel, Stress-Tek and Vulcan businesses. 
VPG Transducers offers a broad line of load cells and force measurement transducers, which also known as force sensors, that are offered as precision sensors for industrial and commercial use. Typical applications for force sensors are in construction machinery (for stability control, overload protection), agricultural equipment (for precision force measurement), and medical devices (such as hospital beds and medication dosing). The heavy equipment market has begun to adopt load cell technology as process control and equipment control features for their products. In some cases, these products use our strain gage products, which serve as sensing elements and components within each unit. Further integration of our load cell technology is also 
- 6 -


offered as part of our weighing module products, which provide customers with a complete sensor assembly that may be used within a wide variety of digital transducers. 
A transducer is mounted on a structure that is subjected to weight or other forces, such as the platform of an industrial scale. The term “load cell” is primarily used to describe transducers used in weighing applications. Strain-gage based transducers consist of one or more strain gages bonded to a metallic support. The change in resistance of the strain gages in response to deformation of the transducer by the applied load is detected by electronic instrumentation. Transducers are manufactured with different designs and configurations depending on their application and the type of stress or strain to be measured; for example, weight or tension. We produce both analog and digital transducers. Modules are transducers combined with a mounting and with external features, such as instruments and cables, and are used for weighing and control applications. We sell our load cells and modules under the overall VPG Transducers name as we continue to transition from the previously used Celtron, Revere, Sensortronics, and Tedea-Huntleigh brands.
Approximately half of VPG Transducer load cell products are sold to third parties as “standard catalog items,” but a growing sector of this segment’s products are sold as non-standard and/or custom products to third parties including OEM manufacturers. Our sales teams act as direct sales channels (field application engineers (“FAEs”)) utilizing the primary customer interface relating to initial design specifications, development of prototypes, and pricing/delivery of this segment’s products. Distributors are also used for those customers that desire standard products.
Our VPG Onboard Weighing business specializes in high-quality, high-accuracy vehicle weighing and load monitoring systems for all commercial vehicle types, including trucks, vans and specialty vehicles. Many of these products use solid-state sensors. VPG Onboard Weighing products, sold under the brand names TruckWeigh and VanWeigh, are used by drivers and fleet operators to monitor vehicle loads within legally permitted limits and regulations.
Our Stress-Tek, Vulcan, and BLH Nobel businesses mainly provide load cells and instrumentation for weighing and force control/measurement for a variety of uses. These include systems to control process weighing in food, chemical, and pharmaceutical plants; force measurement systems used to control web tension in paper mills, cable tension in winch controls; onboard weighing systems installed in logging and waste-handling trucks; and special scale systems used for aircraft weighing and portable truck weighing.
Major components that comprise our Weighing Solutions products include: load cells, electronic displays, signal processors, MEMS sensors, cabling, system software, and communications software/hardware. The end use for the majority of these products is the precision measurement of force, weight, pressure, torque, tilt, motion, and acceleration. FAEs are utilized as the primary customer interface relating to initial design specifications, development of prototypes, and pricing/delivery of this segment's products. We also use distributors and sales agents, as appropriate, to market, sell, and support certain products in this segment.
Measurement Systems
The Measurement Systems segment includes highly specialized systems for steel production, materials development, and safety testing. This segment is comprised of our KELK, DSI, Pacific Instruments, and our DTS businesses. 
Our KELK business provides high accuracy and performance sensors and systems for the steel and aluminum industries — and within those industries, mainly for rolling mills. KELK's products include rolling force measuring load cell systems and pressure transmitters; web tension measurement load cells and systems; optical strip width gages; laser velocimeters for speed and length measurements, and closed-loop crop optimization control systems for optimal strip cuts. Our products are required to meet the most demanding requirements of the steel and aluminum industries, providing high accuracy and reliability under the most demanding harsh conditions of rolling mills.
Our DSI business specializes in thermal-mechanical simulation systems for metallurgical research. Marketed under the name "Gleeble®", DSI's line of physical simulation systems are used by universities, research departments, and development departments within the steel ecosystem to accelerate the development of new metal alloys, explore new production techniques, optimize existing processes, or simulate the conditions a material will face in the real world.
Our Pacific Instruments business offers a broad range of high performance signal conditioning, data acquisition and control systems, many of which reach customers outside our traditional commercial customer base, such as U.S. government-related customers.
Our DTS business provides data acquisition systems and sensors for product safety testing. As a major supplier of embedded data acquisition and data logging capabilities for crash test dummies, DTS expands our offering in the automotive market and in the avionics, military and space market. We believe DTS will continue to benefit from the global need for specialized safety testing technology that is expanding from the automotive and avionics sectors to other applications such as sports safety.

Qualifications and Specifications
Certain of our products must be qualified or approved under various military and aerospace specifications and other standards.
We have qualified certain of our foil resistor and sensor products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the United States Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”), under certain European military specifications, and various aerospace standards approved by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”) and the European Space Agency (“ESA”).
Qualification and specification levels are based in part upon the rate of failure of products. We must continuously perform tests on our products, and report the results for qualified products to the qualifying organization. If a product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level, the product’s classification may be suspended or reduced to a lower level. During the time that the classification is suspended or reduced, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected.
Certain of our load cell and instrumentation products are approved by the National Type Evaluation Program (“NTEP”) and International Organization of Legal Metrology (“OIML”). Many of our weighing systems must also meet these standards to make them usable for legal-for-trade weighing applications. Products and systems that are to be used in hazardous areas, where explosive atmospheres might exist, must comply with special safety standards, such as the European Atmosphère Explosible (“ATEX”) Standard and the U.S. Factory Mutual (“FM”) Standard. Our load cell manufacturing sites undergo periodic audits by regulatory authorities in order to verify compliance with standard requirements and to extend product approvals. 
Manufacturing Operations
Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in Israel, the United States, Canada, India, the People’s Republic of China, Germany, and Japan. We also have manufacturing facilities in Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Republic of China (Taiwan), and France. Over the past several years, we have invested substantial resources to increase capacity and to enhance automation in our plants, which we believe will further reduce production costs.
We have quality management systems at all of our major manufacturing facilities approved under the ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems Standard. ISO 9001 is a comprehensive set of quality program standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO"). The quality management system in our major foil resistors manufacturing site is certified against Aerospace Standard AS9100.
Our DTS business unit, manufacturing data acquisition systems, data loggers and sensors for critical testing for aerospace, military, crash safety, is certified to ISO/IEC 17025 standard. Compliance to this standard ensures that the DTS facilities operate quality management systems, are technically competent and generate technically valid results.
To maintain our cost competitiveness, we are pursuing our strategic initiatives to shift manufacturing emphasis to more advanced automation in higher-labor-cost regions and to relocate production to regions with skilled workforces and relatively lower labor costs. See additional information in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Cost Management” related to our restructuring efforts.
Sources of Supplies
Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers. The principal materials used in our products include various metallic foil alloys, aluminum, stainless steel, tool steel, plastics, and for a few products, gold. Some of the most highly specialized materials for our sensors are sourced from a single vendor. We maintain a safety stock inventory of certain critical materials at our facilities. We are taking steps to determine the use, source, and origin of any tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold in our global product portfolio and, if appropriate, would work with our suppliers to remediate issues and source more responsibly.
A portion of our Weighing Solutions and Measurement Systems segment products are based on strain gages produced by our Sensors segment.
Inventory and Backlog
We manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications. We maintain an inventory of standardized components, and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products.
We include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months. Many of our customers for strain gages, load cells, and foil resistors encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products. They typically order products from us based on their forecasts. If the customers' business needs change, they may 
- 8 -


cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog, in many instances without the payment of any penalty. Therefore, the backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
Customers and Marketing
Our customer base is diversified in terms of industry, geographic region, and range of product needs. No single customer comprises greater than 10% of net revenues. A portion of our products are used in the broad industrial market for wide variety of applications in waste management, bulk hauling, logging, scales manufacturing, engineering systems, pharmaceutical, oil, chemical, steel, paper, and food industries. In addition, we sell to an expanding array of end markets including test and measurement, steel, medical, construction, agricultural, and consumer.
Many of our products have historically been sold by dedicated sales forces, consisting mainly of FAEs focusing on specific market segments or specific customers. The FAEs help identify the products in our portfolio that best meet the needs of our customers and provide technical and applications support. Their in-depth knowledge of customer needs is a key factor in new product design and future research and development initiatives.
Competition
Our competitive success depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of superior product capability and performance, product quality, know-how, proprietary data, market knowledge, service capability and business reputation. Price competitiveness can be an important factor, especially within our Weighing Solutions segment. Our sales and marketing programs offer our customers a broad range of world-class precision technologies, and superior global sales and support.
Competition in the markets where we sell the bulk of our products is extremely fragmented, both geographically and by application. To our knowledge, there are no competitors with the same product mix and proprietary technology as ours. Our competitors range from very small, local companies to large, international companies with greater financial resources than us. 
Our foil resistors and our foil strain gages are based on our proprietary technology. Competitors try to compete in this market using different technology to offer functionally equivalent products. Examples of competition in our Sensors segment includes KOA, Bourns, Vishay Intertechnology, TT Electronics, Susumu, Isabellenhute, Caddock and Flat Dashi for foil resistors, and HBK, an operating company of Spectris, Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd (TML), Kyowa and Zemic for foil strain gages. Competitors in our Weighing Solutions segment include HBK, Zemic, Utilcell, Flintec, Hardy Instruments and Mettler-Toledo for load cell products, and Air-Weigh, Vehicle Weighing Systems, MOBA, and AMCS for onboard weighing products. In the Measurement Systems segment, we compete with ABB, Siemens, Haehne, Dalian, IMS and Fuji in the steel market and Kistler for data acquisition systems.
Research and Development
Many of our products, manufacturing techniques, and technologies have been invented, designed, and developed by our engineers and scientists. Special proprietary resistive metal foil is the most important material in both our foil resistors and our foil strain gages, and our research and development activities related to foil materials are an important linkage between these two products.
We maintain strategically placed design centers for each of our business segments where proximity to customers enables us to more easily monitor and satisfy the needs of local markets. These design centers are located in the United States, Israel, Canada, Sweden, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. 
We also maintain research and development staff, and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products, and to improve manufacturing techniques. This decentralized approach encourages individualized product development at specific manufacturing facilities that occasionally has applications at other facilities.
Our research and development staff and our sales force are closely linked. Our sales force is comprised of individuals with an engineering background who can help meet the needs of our customers for technical and applications support. This in-depth knowledge of customer needs and specifications is a key factor in future research and development initiatives.
Research and development will continue to play a key role in our efforts to introduce innovative products for new sales, and to improve profitability. We expect to continue to expand our position as a leading supplier of precision foil technology products. We believe our R&D efforts should provide us with a variety of opportunities to leverage technology, products, and our manufacturing base and, ultimately, our financial performance. To that end, we expect to sustain or increase our R&D expenditures in order to fill the product development pipeline and lay the foundation for future sales growth.

Patents and Licenses
We have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products. We seek to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business. Although we have numerous United States and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes, no particular patent is considered individually material to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and continuing technological innovation.
Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. Although we have been awarded, have filed applications for, or have obtained numerous patents in the United States and other countries, there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents, or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued.
We require all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees, and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed, or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity’s or individual’s relationship with us, is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Substantially all of our technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us.
Environmental, Social and Governance
As part of our launch of a corporate Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") program in 2022, we completed a materiality assessment, developed a multi-year ESG plan, and established an internal scorecard with short and long-term objectives. 
The implementation of our multi-year ESG plan is on track as evidenced by our actions over the past year, which include revising our Board Committee charters and other applicable governance documents to include ESG-related topics and oversight, launching a sustainability website, sharing key ESG performance indicators with our stockholders, key stakeholders and the general public and adding ESG policies on Human Rights and Solid and Hazardous Waste. Our multi-year ESG plan continues to be built on four pillars: Our People, Our Environment, Our Governance and Our Products, and serves as a guiding framework that will be added to as new trends, requests from stakeholders and internal business strategies require. 
We have issued an Environmental, Health and Safety Policy that sets forth our commitment to achieving health and safety for employees and protecting of the environment, to maintaining compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, to promoting proper management of hazardous materials, and to minimizing the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations. In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to various regional, federal, state, and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment. Since we are subject to Environmental, Health and Safety laws worldwide we incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs to comply with such laws and any investigations of us related to such laws.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,700 total employees, substantially all of which were full-time employees. Approximately 84% of our employees were located outside the United States. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel. Some of our employees outside the United States are members of trade unions. 
We support worldwide employment and promotion of diversity to innovate and drive long-term value, by continuous monitoring of compensation and benefits to assure competitiveness, while implementing a worldwide talent strategy that includes workforce planning and succession planning.
The impact of COVID-19 on our operations has been mitigated through the issuance of Guidelines for Manufacturing Safety, Travel Safety and Personal Protective Equipment sourcing to ensure employee and visitor, contractor safety and continuity of operations. We have had no employee strikes or work stoppages due to labor disputes and we consider our relationship with employees to be generally good, however, no assurance can be given that labor unrest or strikes will not occur. We continue to support employee’s rights to collective bargaining and other recognized employee interests to organize.
