History and Significant Events
Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc.
In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for property and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.
In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. 
In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units.
In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market.
In fiscal 2018, we opened a development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts.
Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their respective brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase speed and accuracy, integrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship.

Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from ongoing support and maintenance agreements, subscription services, cloud applications and professional services.
Products, Support and Professional Services
We are a leading developer and marketer of software enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including: software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and, professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions.
We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories: 

• | Products (hardware and software)


• | Support, maintenance and subscription services


• | Professional services

Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows:

 | Year ended March 31,
(In thousands) | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 
Products | $ | 39,003 | | $ | 33,699 | $ | 38,339 
Support, maintenance and subscription services | 75,496 | | 69,068 | | 63,308 
Professional services | 26,343 | | 24,593 | | 26,031 
Total | $ | 140,842 | | $ | 127,360 | $ | 127,678

Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions' ability to help our customer meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases. 
Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting these offerings while market demand for maintenance services and updates that enhance reliability, as well as the desire for flexibility in purchasing options, continue to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.
Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money.
Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions:
The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated "platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage including the applications necessary to support this ecosystem.

Our technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our focus is to help hospitality operators recruit and retain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey - from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions.

Flexible Check-in and Check-out Solutions

We operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA.
The hotel and resort market sector remains strong and continues to expand with record-setting occupancy for US hotels 3 years in a row according to the 2019 Lodging Technology Study. Occupancy rates increased to 66.4% in 2018 which is up from 65.9% in 2017. Revenue per available room (RevPar) has increased at least 3% eight years in a row and CPA firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts RevPar will increase by 2.6% in 2019. Along with the current expansion of the hotel revenue, IT Budgets for Hoteliers increased by 15% in 2018 and are expected to continue to increase by similar amounts in 2019. Overall technology spend has increased on a percentage of revenue basis from 3.5% in 2016 to 4.6% of revenue in 2018. Of the technology spend as a percentage of revenue, our products nearly 40% of these items or about 1.7% of the 2018 hotel revenues. 
We have a significant customer base in the commercial casino and gaming sector. According to CPA firm Rubin Brown's Gaming Services Group, U.S. Gaming industry annual revenues grew to nearly $79 billion in 2018, as compared to approximately $76 billion in 2017 and $73 billion in 2016. Amenities in contemporary casinos extend well beyond gaming to include a variety of entertainment and leisure options as well as modern convention centers and meeting facilities to attract the corporate market. International gaming markets are growing rapidly both in size and new jurisdictions. Asian gaming markets continue to generate robust growth. Gross gaming revenue in Macau exceeds that of the Las Vegas Strip, with a number of the current and planned properties in the region operated by U.S.-based companies. As the market share leader in providing POS and PMS to casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, we are well positioned to benefit from these strong and long-standing relationships as our customer base expands into international markets. Additionally, as gaming operators migrate toward cashless operations, optimization of non-gaming spend and digital track-and-log of unique guest behavior, we are able to provide the requisite technologies and expertise to satisfy their needs. Between the hotel and resort sector and the gaming sector we currently serve approximately 271,000 rooms out of a possible market of 17.5 million rooms worldwide.

The food service management (FSM) sector services restaurants in corporate cafes, airports, healthcare facilities, universities, stadiums and arenas. The industry employs around 700,000 individuals and continues to expand. According to the IBIS World Industry Report, labor and wages have reduced in the sector as a percentage of revenue over the past 5 years as operators continue to look for overall labor efficiency improvements. The FSM sector has a focus on faster line time, food cost optimization and reducing costs. IBISWorld expects the FSM industry revenue to increase from nearly $48 billion to nearly $53 billion over the next five years. The healthcare division continues to expand with an aging population increasing their need for large cafeterias in their facilities. The Sports and Entertainment (S&E) division has continued to grow over the last five years as sporting event attendance has been on the incline. The S&E sector is very sensitive to customer spending patterns, driven by quality and range of food service. Our technologies position us well in the FSM sector to support their cost and revenue initiatives in these high volume environments. 
We also have expertise in serving the unique needs of Cruise ship operators. Guests and potential guests are expecting an experience that reflects their unique tastes, preferences and travel habits, and cruise operators have seen the need to adequately support the increasing level of personalization and detail required to capture the highest level of guest satisfaction. Our products and services are designed to best help them deliver on this critical part of their business. According to the Cruise Lines International Association and Cruise Market Watch 2018, cruise lines continued the growth trends of recent years in 2018. The worldwide cruise ship fleet currently stands at 314 ships and the current order book includes 18 new ships to be delivered by 2019. The industry carried an estimated 26.0 million passengers in 2018, up from nearly 25.2 million passengers in 2017.
Customers
Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique companies, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important, particularly in the lodging, casino, destination resort, cruise line, foodservice industries where competition for guest recruitment is intense. During fiscal 2017, we had one customer representing 10% of consolidated revenue for the year due to a large scale project. Otherwise, our customer base is highly fragmented.
Seasonality
Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results.
Competition
Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. 
We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., NCR, Constellation Software, Inc., Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with software companies like POSitouch, Northwind and Appetize Technologies. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.
Environmental Matters
We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations. 
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, we had 936 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, have had no strikes or work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
