Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics for cancer and, through our license to Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Santen), wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. We are a leader in the field of endoglin biology and are using our expertise to develop antibodies that bind to the endoglin receptor. Endoglin is essential to angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation required for solid cancer growth and wet AMD. We are developing our lead product candidate, TRC105 (carotuximab), an endoglin antibody, for the treatment of multiple solid tumor types in combination with inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, pathway, or in combination with inhibitors of the programmed cell death protein 1, or PD-1, pathway. The VEGF pathway regulates vascular development in the embryo, or vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis, while the PD-1 pathway represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism that protects tumors from host immunity. We believe treatment with TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors or PD-1 inhibitors may improve survival in cancer patients when compared to treatment with a VEGF inhibitor or PD-1 inhibitor alone. TRC105 has been studied in 13 completed Phase 2 clinical trials and four completed Phase 1 clinical trials, and is currently being dosed in one Phase 3 clinical trial, three Phase 2 clinical trials and one Phase 1 clinical trial.

Our TRC105 oncology clinical development plan is broad and involves a tiered approach. We are initially focused on angiosarcoma which is a tumor that highly expresses endoglin, the target of TRC105, and therefore may be more responsive to treatment with TRC105. We have seen complete durable responses in this tumor type and are currently enrolling the international multicenter Phase 3 TAPPAS trial in angiosarcoma. We obtained Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on our clinical trial design for the Phase 3 trial in angiosarcoma and also incorporated scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding the adequacy of the trial design. We also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for TRC105 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, including angiosarcoma, in 2016. The trial is an adaptive design and based on the planned interim analysis, the trial will accrue a variable number of patients into one of four zones: 190 patients if the interim results lie in the favorable or unfavorable zones, 340 patients if the interim results lie in the promising zone, or 220 patients with cutaneous disease if the interim results lie in the enrichment zone. In the case the interim results are in the unfavorable zone, the DMC could also terminate the trial for futility. The TAPPAS trial has enrolled more than 120 patients to date and based on current accrual rates and the occurrence of events that define the primary endpoint of Progression Free Survival (PFS), we expect to conduct the interim analysis to determine the final sample size and eligible population for the trial in April 2019 and expect final data in 2020, which could vary dependent upon the final sample size and the rate at which events occur.
 The next tier of TRC105 development includes a Phase 2 trial in the mid-size indication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The trial is ongoing, with completion of enrollment of up to 33 patients and top-line data expected by the first quarter of 2020. Positive data from this Phase 2 trial could enable Phase 3 development and we consider this indication attractive because the endpoint for regulatory approval may be attained more quickly than the endpoint for other indications. We also expect this indication would be for the same line of treatment for which the companion VEGF inhibitor is approved. 
 Finally, the third tier of TRC105 development includes large indications including a Phase 1/2 trial in breast cancer, a Phase 2 trial in prostate cancer, and a Phase 1 trial in lung cancer. Positive data in these larger indications could enable further development. The lung cancer trial represents the initial study of TRC105 in combination with Opdivo® (nivolumab), an inhibitor of the PD-1 checkpoint pathway, and is based on preclinical data demonstrating that TRC105 potentiated PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment in three separate tumor models that were presented at the International Cancer Microenvironment Society meeting in 2018.
 We have produced a formulation of TRC105 called DE-122 for ophthalmology indications, which is being developed by Santen for the treatment of wet AMD, the leading cause of blindness in the Western world. In March 2014, Santen licensed from us exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize DE-122 and in July 2017, Santen initiated dosing in the randomized Phase 2a AVANTE study of DE-122, which is a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of repeated intravitreal injections of DE-122 in combination with Lucentis® (ranibizumab) compared to Lucentis single agent therapy in patients with wet AMD. Santen has expanded enrollment in the randomized Phase 2a AVANTE study and we expect top-line data in early 2020. 
 
Our second clinical stage product oncology candidate is TRC102, a small molecule being developed for the treatment of lung cancer and mesothelioma. TRC102 reverses resistance to specific chemotherapeutics by inhibiting base excision repair, or BER. In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy, including agents approved for the treatment of lung cancer and mesothelioma. TRC102 is being studied in a Phase 2 trial with Temodar in patients with ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancer and with Alimta (pemetrexed) in patients with mesothelioma, in addition to two Phase 1 trials.
 
We are also developing TRC253, a small molecule compound we licensed from Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (Janssen) in September 2016. TRC253 is being developed for the treatment of men with prostate cancer and is a novel small molecule high affinity competitive inhibitor of wild type androgen receptor (AR) and multiple AR mutant receptors containing point mutations that cause drug resistance to currently approved treatments. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC253 in March 2017, established the recommended Phase 2 dose in July 2018, and subsequently commenced the Phase 2 portion of the trial, which is currently enrolling. We expect to present top-line data from the Phase 1 portion of the study in 2019 and expect top-line data from the Phase 2 portion of the study by the end of 2020.  Until 90 days after we complete the initial Phase 1/2 study, Janssen has an exclusive option to reacquire full rights to TRC253 for an upfront payment of $45.0 million to us, and obligations to make regulatory and commercialization milestone payments totaling up to $137.5 million upon achievement of specified events and a low single-digit royalty. If Janssen does not exercise its exclusive option to reacquire the program, we would then retain worldwide development and commercialization rights, in which case we would be obligated to pay Janssen a total of up to $45.0 million in development and regulatory milestones upon achievement of specified events, in addition to a low single digit royalty. We also licensed TRC694 (formerly JNJ-6420694), a novel, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of NF-kB inducing kinase (NIK), from Janssen in September 2016. Following completion of the pre-clinical development of TRC694, we determined the compound did not warrant further development and in February 2019, we issued written notice to terminate the agreement with respect to TRC694 and returned TRC694 and all rights thereto to Janssen.
 We utilize a product development platform that emphasizes capital efficiency. Our experienced clinical operations, data management, quality assurance, product development and regulatory affairs groups manage significant aspects of our clinical trials with internal resources. We use these internal resources to minimize the costs associated with utilizing contract research organizations, 
 4

or CROs. In our experience, this model has resulted in capital efficiencies and improved communication with clinical trial sites, which expedites patient enrollment and improves the quality of patient data as compared to a CRO-managed model. We have leveraged this platform in all of our ongoing clinical trials including our international Phase 3 TAPPAS trial in angiosarcoma. We have also leveraged our product development platform to diversify our product pipeline without payment of upfront license fees.  In 2016 we executed a license agreement with Janssen for TRC253 and TRC694 without an upfront payment. In November 2018 we entered into separate strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreements (the Collaboration Agreements) with I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab) for TJ004309 (the TJ004309 Agreement), a novel, humanized antibody against CD73 expressed on stromal cells and tumors that converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, which is highly immunosuppressive, and for the development of up to 5 bi-specific antibodies (the Bispecific Agreement) that includes US commercialization rights, which were both executed without an upfront payment to I-Mab. We continue to evaluate ex-U.S. companies that are in need of a rapid and capital-efficient U.S. drug development solution that includes U.S. and European Union (EU) clinical development expertise and U.S. commercialization expertise. We believe we can become a preferred clinical developmental and U.S. commercialization partner through a cost- and risk-sharing partnership structure which may include U.S. commercialization.  
 Pursuant to the TJ004309 Agreement, we have begun development of I-Mab’s proprietary CD73 antibody TJ004309, also known as TJD5. In December 2018, we submitted an IND application to the FDA, which was subsequently cleared in January 2019. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study and begin enrollment in the U.S. in the first half of 2019 to assess safety and preliminary efficacy of TJ004309 as a single agent and when combined with a PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced solid tumors. The Bispecific Agreement allows for the development of up to five of I-Mab’s proprietary bispecific antibody product candidates to be nominated within a five-year period for development and commercialization in North America, with the option to opt-in and acquire product rights outside of Greater China and Korea.
We have also collaborated with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which selected TRC105 and TRC102 for federal funding of clinical development, as well as Case Western Cancer Center (Case Western), the University of Alabama – Birmingham (UAB), and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Under these collaborations, NCI sponsored or is sponsoring ten completed or ongoing clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102, Case Western sponsored two clinical trials of TRC102, UAB is sponsoring one clinical trial of TRC105, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is sponsoring one clinical trial of TRC105. All TRC105 NCI sponsored trials have been completed.
 The following table summarizes key information regarding ongoing development of our product candidates:

Our goal is to be a leader in the development of targeted therapies for patients with cancer and other diseases of high unmet medical need. As key components of our strategy, we intend to:
 
 
• | Focus the initial tier of clinical development of TRC105 on oncology indications that highly express endoglin and have demonstrated durable complete responses to treatment, and have potential reduced time to regulatory approval. We initiated dosing in 2017 and are currently enrolling our international multicenter randomized Phase 3 TAPPAS clinical trial of TRC105 in angiosarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma that highly expresses endoglin, in combination with the approved VEGF inhibitor Votrient® (pazopanib) versus single agent Votrient. We expect an interim analysis in

April 2019 that will determine the final sample size and we expect top-line data in 2020, which could vary dependent upon the final sample size and the rate at which events occur. We obtained SPA agreement from the FDA on our clinical trial design for the Phase 3 TAPPAS trial in angiosarcoma and also incorporated scientific advice from the EMA regarding the adequacy of the trial design. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival, or the time a patient lives without the cancer progressing, rather than overall survival. A progression-free survival primary endpoint can be achieved sooner than an overall survival endpoint, thereby reducing the time to complete the clinical trial and submit applications for regulatory approval. We also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for TRC105 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, including angiosarcoma, in 2016.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus the second tier of clinical development of TRC105 on oncology indications that have potential reduced time to regulatory approval. We plan to continue ongoing Phase 2 development of TRC105 in combination with an approved VEGF inhibitor in the oncology indication of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is associated with reduced time to achieve the endpoint necessary for regulatory approval, with the goal of enabling a Phase 3 clinical trial in this indication. Although the endpoint for approval for HCC is overall survival, this endpoint is typically reached sooner for HCC than for many other solid tumors. The trial is ongoing, with the completion of enrollment of up to 33 patients and a presentation of data expected in the first quarter of 2020. Positive data from this Phase 2 trial could enable Phase 3 development. Our Phase 2 randomized TRAXAR study in renal cell carcinoma did not meet the primary endpoint of improved PFS and we have discontinued TRC105 development in this indication. We expect to report final data from the TRAXAR study at a scientific conference later this year.

• | Focus the third tier of clinical development of TRC105 on large market oncology indications. To maximize the commercial opportunity of TRC105, we intend to continue developing TRC105 in additional oncology indications with large patient populations. We initiated dosing in a Phase 2 trial of TRC105 in combination with either Zytiga (abiraterone) or Xtandi (enzalutamide) in prostate cancer in 2018, a Phase 1 trial of TRC105 in combination with Opdivo in lung cancer in 2017, and a Phase 1/2 trial of TRC105 with Afinitor® (everolimus) and Femara® (letrozole) in breast cancer in 2016. We expect top-line data in the prostate cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer studies in 2019 that, if positive, could enable further development in these indications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to leverage our collaborative relationship with NCI to accelerate and broaden development of TRC105 and TRC102. Our collaboration with NCI allows us to pursue more indications with our assets than we would otherwise be able to pursue on our own. If merited by Phase 2 data, we expect to fund additional Phase 3 clinical trials of TRC105 and TRC102 and, based on NCI’s past course of conduct with similarly situated pharmaceutical companies in which it has sponsored pivotal clinical trials following receipt of positive Phase 2 data, we anticipate that NCI would sponsor Phase 3 clinical trials in additional indications.

• | Support Santen during clinical development to advance DE-122 in wet AMD. We are using our expertise in the development of endoglin antibodies to assist Santen in the development of DE-122. Santen filed an IND in June 2015 for the development of DE-122, reported safety and bioactivity data from the Phase 1/2 PAVE trial of DE-122 in February 2018, and is currently enrolling wet AMD patients into the Phase 2a AVANTE trial of DE-122, with top-line data expected in 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue development of TRC253 in patients with prostate cancer. We filed an IND in December 2016, which was cleared by the FDA in January 2017. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC253 in March 2017 and the recommended Phase 2 dose was established in July 2018, allowing dosing to commence in the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 trial, which is currently enrolling. We expect to complete enrollment of the Phase 2 portion in 2020. Until 90 days after we complete the initial Phase 1/2 study, Janssen has an exclusive option to reacquire full rights to TRC253 for an upfront payment of $45.0 million to us, and obligations to make regulatory and commercialization milestone payments totaling up to $137.5 million upon achievement of specified events and a low single-digit royalty. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Begin development of TJ004309 in patients with solid tumors. We filed an IND for TJ004309 in December 2018 and in January 2019 the FDA completed their safety review and concluded that we may proceed with our proposed clinical trial for solid tumor patients. We expect to begin dosing patients in a Phase 1/2 study in the first half of 2019 and expect to report Phase 1 data in 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage internal capabilities to advance other programs efficiently and cost effectively through our product development platform. We have assembled a management team that has contributed to the approval of seven therapeutics, including VEGF inhibitors in cancer and in wet AMD, and that has core competencies relating to clinical operations, regulatory affairs, quality assurance and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC). We expect to continue to benefit from these capabilities through the development of additional early and mid-stage product candidates, both from internal programs and potential in-licensed programs, and continue to evaluate ex-U.S. companies who are in

Our Lead Product Candidate– TRC105
 
Rationale for Developing Endoglin Antibodies to Treat Cancer and Wet AMD
 
We focus on developing antibodies that target the endoglin receptor. Endoglin is a protein that is overexpressed on endothelial cells, the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels, when they experience hypoxia, which is a condition characterized by inadequate oxygen supply. Endoglin allows endothelial cells to proliferate in a hypoxic environment and is required for angiogenesis. These properties render endoglin an attractive target for the treatment of diseases that require angiogenesis, including solid cancers and wet AMD, especially in combination with VEGF inhibitors.
 
We believe the endoglin pathway serves as the dominant escape pathway that allows continued angiogenesis despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. We believe that a combination of VEGF and our endoglin antibodies may have application in wet AMD as well as a number of oncology indications where VEGF inhibitors are currently approved by regulatory authorities. Tumor types for which VEGF inhibitors have been approved include colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer.
 
In addition, endoglin is expressed on activated macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs are implicated as a mechanism of tumor evasion from immune surveillance that operates independently of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition.  Endoglin antibodies potentiated the activity of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in three preclinical models of tumor growth, one of early stage cancer and two of late stage cancer.  In a model of late stage cancer, the combination of TRC105 and a PD-1 antibody caused complete regression of 30-60% of palpable tumors in mice.  
 
We believe inhibition of the endoglin pathway may sensitize tumors that are insensitive to treatment with single agent PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that a combination of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors and our endoglin antibodies may have application in a number of oncology indications where PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are currently approved by regulatory authorities, including colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, head and neck cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma and urothelial cancer.
 
Anti-Angiogenesis VEGF and PD-1/PD-L1 Checkpoint Inhibitors in Oncology Indications
 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the Western world and may affect any organ in the human body. Localized cancer is generally treated and cured with surgery. However, metastatic cancer that has spread beyond the location where it started is generally incurable. Metastatic cancer is treated with chemotherapeutics or targeted agents that specifically inhibit pathways implicated in tumor growth or angiogenesis.
 
There are several FDA-approved drugs that inhibit the VEGF pathway or the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint, with over $10.0 billion in reported aggregate worldwide sales in oncology in 2018. VEGF inhibitors or PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are approved in the following oncology indications, among others:
 
 
• | Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Including Angiosarcoma. The American Cancer Society, or the ACS, estimates there were approximately 13,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma in the United States in 2018 with more than 5,100 deaths. Localized tumors are curable, but patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of approximately 12 months following diagnosis. Standard systemic chemotherapy regimens are poorly tolerated and of limited usefulness with response rates of approximately 20% to 30%. Votrient, a small molecule VEGF inhibitor, was approved in the United States for the second line treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in 2013. Votrient is also approved for angiosarcoma where there are an estimated 600 cases annually in the United States and 1,200 cases annually in the European Union. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hepatocellular Carcinoma. The ACS estimates there were approximately 42,200 new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States in 2018 with more than 30,000 deaths. Nexavar, a VEGF inhibitor, is approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China for the first line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 2017, reported global sales of Nexavar were over $900 million worldwide. Opdivo, a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, is approved in the United States for use following prior Nexavar treatment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Colorectal Cancer. The ACS estimates there were approximately 140,300 new cases of colon cancer or rectal cancer in the United States in 2018 with more than 50,600 deaths. Multiple VEGF inhibitors are approved in colorectal cancer: Avastin is approved with chemotherapy for first and second line treatment; Cyramza® (ramucirumab) is approved with chemotherapy for second line treatment; Zaltrap® (ziv-aflibercept) is approved with chemotherapy for second line treatment; Stivarga (regorafenib) is approved for use following prior treatment with chemotherapy and a VEGF inhibitor. The PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors Opdivo and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) are approved in microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer following prior treatment with chemotherapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. The ACS estimates there were approximately 234,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States in 2018 with more than 154,000 deaths. Avastin is approved for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with chemotherapy and Cyramza is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo is approved for second line treatment and Keytruda is approved for first line treatment (with chemotherapy) and second line treatment (as a single agent) of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

TRC105 Development in Oncology
 
Clinical Development Overview
 
TRC105 is our investigational novel human chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is currently being dosed weekly or every two weeks by intravenous, or IV, infusion in clinical trials. Commercialized chimeric antibodies include Rituxan® (rituximab), Erbitux® (cetuximab) and Adcetris® (brentuximab vedotin), which collectively had reported global sales of over $7.0 billion in 2018. 
 
Clinical trials of TRC105 as a single agent in patients whose cancer had progressed on multiple prior therapies indicated limited single agent activity in treatment-resistant patients with prostate cancer, metastatic bladder cancer, advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. However, single agent activity, as evidenced by progression-free survival greater than 18 months or partial response, was achieved in individual treatment-resistant patients with soft tissue sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. VEGF levels are elevated following TRC105 treatment and the collective clinical data support the development of TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors rather than development as a single agent. Initially, TRC105 was studied in the last line treatment setting, where patients tend to be resistant to additional treatments, but ongoing development focuses on the treatment of cancer patients in the first and second line treatment settings, where we expect increased susceptibility to anti-angiogenic treatment. Additionally, TRC105 may be more effective as a single agent in tumor types, including angiosarcoma, known to densely express endoglin.
 
TRC105 is being studied in five ongoing clinical trials and has been studied in 17 completed clinical trials as a single agent or with VEGF inhibitors. The following table summarizes certain key information regarding clinical trials of TRC105 in cancer patients:
 
Ongoing Clinical Trials of TRC105
 
 
 | | | Companion | Design 
Phase | Indication | Sponsor | Treatment | (Number of Patients) 
3 | Angiosarcoma | TRACON | Votrient | Randomized (Up to 340) 
1/2 | Hepatocellular carcinoma | TRACON | Nexavar | Dose escalation portion and single arm portion (up to 33)
1 | Lung cancer | TRACON | Opdivo | Dose escalation portion and single arm portion (up to 30)
1/2 | Breast cancer | UAB | Afinitor and Femara | Dose escalation portion and single arm portion (up to 35)
2 | Prostate cancer | Cedars-Sinai | Zytiga or Xtandi | Parallel cohort single arm (up to 40) 

Ongoing Clinical Trials of TRC105
 
Phase 3 TAPPAS Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Votrient in Patients with Angiosarcoma
 
We are currently enrolling the randomized multicenter international Phase 3 TAPPAS clinical trial of TRC105 following SPA from the FDA and scientific advice from the EMA regarding the adequacy of the trial design.  The trial compares single agent Votrient, an approved VEGF inhibitor, to the combination of Votrient and TRC105, in patients with cutaneous and non-cutaneous angiosarcoma. The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by central radiographic review with overall survival as a secondary endpoint.  In August 2018, we submitted an amendment to the FDA to increase the sample size to account for the fewer than expected number of events that define the endpoint of progression free survival, 
 8

reflecting a higher than expected rate of withdrawal for disease progression unconfirmed by central review. The FDA accepted the amendment, with retention of the SPA, which increased the size of the trial to 190 patients if the interim results lie in the favorable or unfavorable zones, 340 patients if the interim results lie in the promising zone, or 220 patients with cutaneous disease if the interim results lie in the enrichment zone. In the case the interim results are in the unfavorable zone, the DMC could also terminate the trial for futility. The amendment increased the number of patients analyzed at the interim analysis from 70 to 120.  At this time, over 120 patients have enrolled, the interim analysis is expected in April 2019, and top line data are expected in 2020, which could vary dependent upon the final sample size and the rate at which events occur.
 
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Nexavar in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
 
We are currently enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic HCC in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Nexavar, which is approved for the first line treatment of HCC. We reported updated positive data at the ASCO 2019 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in January 2019. Key results included confirmed partial responses by RECIST 1.1 occurred in 3 of 15 (20%) evaluable patients and a reduction of 50% or greater in alpha fetoprotein (AFP) concentration occurred in 6 of 12 (50%) evaluable patients. Reduction in AFP, a tumor marker expressed in patients with HCC, in early treatment may help predict a favorable response to treatment. Since the presentation, one additional patient developed a partial response, such that four of seventeen evaluable patients (24%) have achieved partial responses by RECIST to date. TRC105 trough concentrations were lower in HCC patients compared with prior TRC105 studies in other tumor types, and weekly dosing at 10 mg/kg was required to exceed target concentrations consistently. This may reflect increased target mediated clearance in HCC patients, many of whom had fibrotic or cirrhotic liver disease. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) was observed more frequently in patients with HCC (76%) compared with prior studies of TRC105 in other tumor types (e.g., RCC, sarcoma, and lung where ADA has been approximately 5%) and may prevent prolonged dosing of TRC105 in some patients with HCC. Adverse events typical of each drug did not increase in frequency or severity when TRC105 and sorafenib were administered concurrently. The trial is ongoing, with the completion of enrollment of up to 33 patients and presentation of data expected in the first quarter of 2020.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Opdivo in Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
 We initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Opdivo for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in late 2017. Endoglin is expressed on activated myeloid derived suppressor cells, and we have observed encouraging activity of TRC105, or its preclinical surrogate antibody, in combination with PD-1 inhibitors in preclinical syngeneic mouse tumor models.  Patients were treated with 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of TRC105 weekly for four doses and then 15 mg/kg every two weeks, in combination with the approved dose of Opdivo of 240 mg every two weeks. Best response was assessed by immune RECIST 1.1. In February 2019, at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Targeted Therapies for Lung Cancer conference, an update was presented on the positive top-line data from the dose escalation portion of the trial previously reported in December 2018. The combination of TRC105 and Opdivo was well-tolerated without the development of dose limiting toxicity in six patients who were treated as part of dose escalation. One of these six patients, whose archival tumor did not express PD-L1 and who had not received prior PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition treatment, developed a partial response and remains on study for more than 12 months.  Two of the other five patients, one of whom progressed following prior Opdivo treatment, remain on trial with stable disease.  Patients are currently enrolling into two parallel 12 patient expansion cohorts, one that includes patients who have progressed following prior PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition treatment and one that includes patients who have not received prior PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition treatment. We expect to report top-line data in late 2019. 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Afinitor and Femara in Postmenopausal Women with Newly Diagnosed Local or Locally Advanced Potentially Resectable Hormone-Receptor Positive and Her-2 Negative Breast Cancer
 
UAB is conducting a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 as a neoadjuvant in combination with Afinitor and Femara, each of which is approved for the treatment of breast cancer. The trial is enrolling patients with locally advanced breast cancer who will receive TRC105 in combination with Afinitor and Femara prior to surgical removal of the tumor. Part 1 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 18 patients to determine whether TRC105 can be administered safely concurrently with Afinitor and Femara and assess pharmacokinetic parameters. Part 2 of the trial is expected to enroll up to 20 patients with locally advanced potentially resectable hormone-receptor positive and Her-2 negative breast cancer to determine the pathologic complete response rate and downstaging rate, or rate of tumor size reduction, at the time of surgery. We expect to report data in 2019.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Zytiga and with Xtandi in Prostate Cancer Patients Progressing on Therapy
 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial consisting of parallel single arm cohorts of TRC105 in combination with Zytiga (abiraterone) or TRC105 in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide), in patients who have biochemical but not radiographic progression on prior Zytiga or Xtandi treatment, respectively.  The trial is expected to enroll up to 20 patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer into each cohort. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants with stabilization of disease for at least 2 months or disease improvement at any time from start of combination therapy by radiographic 
 9

and/or biochemical criteria through treatment completion, up to an estimated period of 24 months. We expect Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to report data in 2019.
 
Recently Completed Clinical Trials of TRC105
 
Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Inlyta in Patients with Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
 
In December 2018, we announced our Phase 2 TRAXAR study did not meet its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS from 4.8 to 7.7 months. Prespecified statistical analyses of PFS according to expression of two plasma biomarkers, TGFβ receptor III and osteopontin, also did not achieve statistical significance.  The safety profile observed in TRAXAR was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibitors. We are evaluating additional data from the study and plan to present data at a scientific conference in 2019.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Nexavar in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
 
NCI conducted a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Nexavar, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in 27 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Part 1 of the trial was completed following the enrollment of 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 15 of whom were evaluable by RECIST 1.1, and Part 2 of the trial was initiated in the third quarter of 2014 and enrolled 22 patients. Part 1 of the trial was designed as an ascending dose trial with an expansion stage with the primary endpoint of evaluating the safety and tolerability of 3, 6, 10 and 15 mg/kg TRC105 every two weeks in combination with the approved dose of Nexavar to select a dose level of TRC105 (in combination with Nexavar) for further study if merited. The NCI published the results from the trial in 2017 in the journal Clinical Cancer Research. These data assessed the overall response rate by RECIST across four dose groups.  All observed responses occurred in the two highest dose groups, in which 5 of 15 (33%) patients demonstrated a response.  Four patients had confirmed stable disease, one of whom was treated for 22 months. Median PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.2-5.6 months) and median overall survival was 15.5 months (95% CI: 8.5-26.3 months). Nexavar was approved for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC based on median OS of 10.7 months (95% CI: 9.4-13.3 months) versus 7.9 months (95% CI: 6.8-9.1 months) with placebo in the multicenter SHARP trial.  The overall response rate by RECIST for Nexavar treatment in the SHARP trial was 2%.
 
Maximum percentage change in target lesion size in
 hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with TRC105 and Nexavar
 


Based on these data, we initiated dosing in a multicenter Phase 1b/2 study of TRC105 in hepatocellular carcinoma and reported updated response rate data in January 2019.

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Votrient in Patients with Soft Tissue Sarcoma
 
We conducted a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Votrient, an approved VEGF inhibitor, in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Part 1 of the trial completed enrollment of 18 evaluable patients. TRC105 and Votrient demonstrated encouraging preliminary signs of activity in a highly pretreated population, including partial responses by Choi criteria in six of 18 (33%) patients, including a complete response by RECIST 1.1 that was sustained for over two years in a patient with cutaneous angiosarcoma.  
 
Based on the tolerability and anti-tumor activity observed, Part 2 of the trial began enrollment in September 2014. Part 2 of the trial completed accrual of the planned 63 patients at eight sites in the United States in November 2015, and top-line data indicate that median PFS unstratified by histology or tumor endoglin expression (3.9 months) was similar to the PFS expected for Votrient alone, based on data from the Votrient Phase 3 PALETTE trial in soft tissue sarcoma. However, median PFS in patients with angiosarcoma was superior to that reported in five prior trials of single agent VEGF inhibitors.  Therefore, additional angiosarcoma patients were enrolled, such that 18 in total were treated initially with the combination of TRC105 and Votrient and nine were treated with single agent TRC105 followed by the combination of TRC105 and Votrient at progression. PFS in patients treated with single agent TRC105 was similar to the PFS reported following treatment with single agent VEGF inhibitors in angiosarcoma. However, PFS and complete response rate with the combination of TRC105 and Votrient was superior to prior studies of single agent VEGF inhibitors in angiosarcoma.
 
Updated data were presented in November 2017 at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS) annual meeting for the 18 angiosarcoma patients treated with the combination of TRC105 and Votrient, two of whom had complete responses to treatment. Median PFS was 7.8 months in 13 VEGF inhibitor naïve angiosarcoma patients treated with the combination of TRC105 and Votrient using either 10 mg/kg weekly dosing or the hybrid dosing schedule of TRC105. The median PFS compared favorably to the median PFS of 1.8 to 3.8 months reported in five studies of single agent VEGF inhibitors (including Votrient) in patients with angiosarcoma. In the 17 patients who received prior treatment for metastatic disease, treatment duration on TRC105 and Votrient exceeded treatment duration of the most recent prior therapy in seven of 12 VEGF naïve angiosarcoma patients and two of five patients who received a prior VEGF inhibitor as part of their most recent therapy. TRC105 administered at its recommended Phase 2 dose of 10 mg/kg weekly was well-tolerated in combination with Votrient at its approved dose, which allowed for prolonged dosing without an increase in the frequency or severity of adverse events typical of each individual drug. 
 

Phase 1 Clinical Trial of TRC105 with Taxol, Carboplatin and Avastin in Patients with Lung Cancer
 
We initiated dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of TRC105 in combination with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin for the initial treatment of advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in 2016. The combination of Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin is approved for the initial treatment of advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and the combination of Taxol and Avastin is approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine whether TRC105 can be safely administered concurrently with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin. Thirteen patients were treated with TRC105 
 11

concurrently with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, overall response rate by RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival and overall survival.

In September 2018, data were presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) in Toronto, Canada. Four of 13 (31%) evaluable patients had partial response by RECIST 1.1, including one patient who achieved an 81% reduction in tumor volume. The combination of TRC105 with Taxol, carboplatin and Avastin was determined to be able to be safely administered. However, current development of TRC105 in lung cancer is focused on combining TRC105 with Opdivo. 
 
Safety of TRC105 as a Single Agent and in Combination with Approved VEGF Inhibitors and/or Chemotherapy
 
In clinical trials as of December 31, 2018, TRC105 has been administered to more than 600 patients and was generally well tolerated as a single agent and in combination with VEGF inhibitors and chemotherapy. The most commonly reported adverse events related to TRC105 therapy, either alone or in combination, have included anemia, dilated small vessels in the skin and mucosal membranes (which may result in nosebleeds and bleeding of the gums), headache, and gastrointestinal and other symptoms during the initial infusion of TRC105, or infusion reactions. Infusion reactions were reduced in frequency and severity through the use of premedication. The majority of treatment-related adverse events have been mild. Serious adverse events considered related to TRC105 have largely been isolated events.
 
TRC105 does not appear to be highly immunogenic and patients with anti-drug-antibodies have not demonstrated specific clinical effects, however we have observed a higher frequency of immunogenicity in patients with HCC.
 
TRC105 Investigational New Drug Applications
 
We are evaluating TRC105 in the United States in clinical trials under three INDs, the first of which we filed with the FDA in November 2007 for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors, the second of which we filed with the FDA in September 2014 for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, and subsequently gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, and the third of which we filed with the FDA in June 2016 for the treatment of patients with sarcoma. Subsequent amendments to the first IND have included clinical protocols to study TRC105 alone, or in combination with VEGF inhibitors, in patients with multiple tumor types. TRC105 has also been studied in the United States under three INDs sponsored by NCI to evaluate TRC105 in patients with prostate cancer, liver cancer and bladder cancer, which NCI filed in December 2009, December 2010 and August 2010, respectively, and one IND sponsored by NCI to evaluate TRC105 in patients with renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, which NCI filed in April 2012. The INDs filed by NCI cross reference our initial solid tumor IND. TRC105 is also being administered to oncology patients under investigator-sponsored and compassionate use protocols. 
Translational Research
 
Soluble biomarker studies in patients with renal cell carcinoma in a Phase 1b trial indicated that baseline osteopontin and TGF-β receptor 3 concentrations were associated with response rate.  These markers were assessed for correlation with efficacy in the randomized Phase 2 TRAXAR trial, and expression of these baseline biomarkers were not associated with efficacy. In the Phase 1b sarcoma trial, patients who had a greater than 10% reduction in tumor volume following treatment with TRC105 and Votrient were significantly more likely to have lower baseline levels of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and thrombospondin-2.  These markers will be evaluated for correlation with efficacy in the randomized Phase 3 TAPPAS angiosarcoma trial to assess if expression of a baseline biomarker is associated with efficacy.  
 
Endoglin expressing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are being studied in the Phase 3 TAPPAS angiosarcoma trial.  Updated data were presented in November 2018 at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS) annual meeting. Paired patient plasma samples taken at baseline and six weeks following treatment with either TRC105 and Votrient or single agent Votrient were analyzed in a blinded manner, without knowledge of treatment assignment. Endoglin expressing CTCs decreased overall after 6 weeks of study treatment.  Three key findings emerged in the blinded analysis:
  
• | 18 of 51 patients (35%) had a greater than two-fold reduction in endoglin expressing CTCs, including 13/51 patients (25%) with a greater than 10-fold reduction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 19 of 51 patients (37%) had a greater than two-fold increase in endoglin expressing CTCs, including 13/51 patients (25%) with a greater than 10-fold increase.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 14 of 51 patients (27%) had no significant change in endoglin expressing CTCs, all but one of whom had fewer than four endoglin expressing CTCs per mL detected at baseline.

Role of Endoglin Antibodies in AMD Treatment
 
Overview of AMD
 
AMD is a major public health problem that has a devastating effect on patients. AMD distorts central vision, which is necessary for daily activities such as reading, face recognition, watching television and driving and can lead to loss of central vision and blindness. According to a 2010 study sponsored by AMD Alliance International, the annual direct healthcare system cost of visual impairment worldwide due to AMD was estimated at approximately $255 billion.
 
According to the Macular Degeneration Partnership, approximately 15 million people in the United States and 30 million people worldwide suffer from some form of AMD. There are two forms of AMD: dry AMD and wet AMD. It is reported that wet AMD represents approximately 10% of all cases of AMD, but is responsible for 90% of the severe vision loss associated with the disease. Wet AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the Western world.
 
In a subset of AMD patients, dry AMD progresses to wet AMD as a result of abnormal angiogenesis in the choroid layer beneath the retina, which is referred to as choroidal neovascularization, or CNV. In the context of wet AMD, CNV is associated with the accumulation of other cell types and altered tissue. The new blood vessels associated with this abnormal angiogenesis tend to be fragile and often bleed and leak fluid into the macula, the central-most portion of the retina responsible for central vision and color perception. If left untreated, the blood vessel growth and associated leakage typically lead to retinal distortion and eventual retinal scarring, with irreversible destruction of the macula and loss of vision. This visual loss occurs rapidly with a progressive course.
 
Currently Available Therapies for Wet AMD
 
The current standard of care for wet AMD is administration by intraocular injection of VEGF inhibitors as single agents. VEGF inhibitors have been reported to be effective in treating wet AMD because of their ability to inhibit the effects of abnormal angiogenesis that defines CNV. The FDA has approved the VEGF inhibitors Lucentis (ranibizumab), Eylea® and Macugen® (pegaptanib sodium) for the treatment of wet AMD. Lucentis is an antibody fragment derived from the same full length antibody from which Avastin was derived. In 2017, annual worldwide sales of Lucentis and Eylea for all indications totaled more than $8.0 billion. This sales number does not include Avastin, which is commonly used off-label to treat wet AMD in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the European Union.
 
The availability of VEGF inhibitors has significantly improved visual outcomes for many patients with wet AMD. A retrospective study published in 2012 confirmed that the prevalence of both legal blindness and moderate visual impairment in patients two years after being diagnosed with wet AMD has decreased substantially following the introduction of VEGF inhibitor therapy. Nonetheless, the condition of many patients with wet AMD treated with VEGF inhibitors does not improve significantly and in many cases deteriorates.
 
VEGF inhibitors prevent VEGF from binding to its natural receptor on endothelial cells in the abnormal new blood vessels, thereby inhibiting further CNV and leakage associated with wet AMD. However, VEGF inhibitor therapy may be limited in its ability to improve CNV. Results of third-party clinical trials suggest that visual outcomes for wet AMD patients receiving treatment with a VEGF inhibitor worsen over time and are often associated with the development of subretinal fibrosis and the growth of CNV over time.  At the present time, the development of agents that effectively complement approved treatment in wet AMD remains an unmet need.
 
As is the case with angiogenesis that drives tumor growth, we believe that the endoglin pathway serves as an escape pathway that allows continued CNV despite inhibition of the VEGF pathway. In addition, the impact of VEGF inhibitors may be limited by the activity of pericytes, which are the cells that cover the outside of blood vessels and support and stabilize newly formed vessels. Pericytes are not targeted by VEGF inhibitor therapies, but because they express endoglin, they are an additional target for endoglin antibodies such as TRC105. These facts provide the rationale for treating wet AMD with a combination of endoglin antibodies and VEGF inhibitors.
 
DE-122 for Wet AMD
 
Our endoglin antibodies for ophthalmology indications are being developed in collaboration with Santen. We have produced a formulation of TRC105 for development in ophthalmology that Santen is developing under the name DE-122. In June 2015, Santen filed an IND with the FDA for the initiation of clinical studies for DE‐122 in patients with wet AMD.  Santen is currently enrolling the Phase 2a AVANTE clinical trial of DE-122 in wet AMD patients and top-line data are expected in early 2020. In addition, safety and bioactivity data from the Phase 1/2 PAVE trial were reported at the Bascom Palmer conference on Angiogenesis, Exudation and Regeneration on February 10, 2018.
 
13

The open-label, dose-escalation, sequential-cohort Phase 1/2 study assessed the safety, tolerability, and bioactivity of a single intravitreal injection of DE-122 at four dose levels in 12 subjects (n=3 per dose) with wet AMD refractory to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Subjects were followed up to 90 days. No serious adverse events were reported. One adverse event of yellowish deposits in the vitreous was reported to be related to DE-122 in cohort 2 of 4, that spontaneously resolved. Eight of twelve refractory wet AMD patients demonstrated signs of bioactivity, as evidenced by improved visual acuity, decreased macular edema or decreased fluorescein leak by angiography, after treatment with DE-122 followed by a single dose of the VEGF inhibitor treatment used prior to study entry.  In July 2017, Santen initiated the Phase 2a AVANTE clinical study of DE-122 for the treatment of patients with wet AMD. The Phase 2a AVANTE study is a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of repeated intravitreal injections of DE-122 in combination with Lucentis compared to Lucentis monotherapy in patients with wet AMD.
 
Our Second Product Candidate – TRC102
 
Overview of Base Excision Repair and the Mechanism of Action of TRC102
 
Base-excision repair, or BER, is a complex and fundamental cellular process used by cancer cells to repair the DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutics, especially the classes of chemotherapeutics known as alkylating agents, including Temodar, dacarbazine and bis-dichloroethyl-nitrosourea, or BCNU, and anti-metabolite agents, including Fludara and Alimta. The process of BER removes DNA bases damaged by chemotherapy, resulting in the formation of gaps in the DNA strand called apurinic and apyrimidinic, or AP, sites. The appropriate base is then inserted in this gap to restore the proper tumor DNA sequence. By this process, cancer cells can circumvent the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy.
 
Inhibition of BER has been proposed as a way to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutics; however, to our knowledge, no inhibitors of BER have been tested in clinical trials. We are developing TRC102 (methoxyamine hydrochloride) to reverse resistance to specific chemotherapeutics by inhibiting BER. TRC102 interrupts BER by rapidly and covalently binding within AP sites, converting the AP site to a substrate for the enzyme topoisomerase II, which cleaves TRC102-bound DNA, resulting in an accumulation of DNA strand breaks that trigger cellular apoptosis, or programmed cell death, as illustrated in the figure below:
 


TRC102 binding results in apoptosis
 

The induction of apoptosis by TRC102 is relatively selective for cancer cells, which typically overexpress topoisomerase II. In nonmalignant cells with low topoisomerase II expression, TRC102-bound DNA is excised and replaced by a separate DNA repair system.

TRC102 Development in Oncology
 
TRC102 is being developed to reverse resistance to Temodar, an alkylating chemotherapeutic, as well as to Alimta and Fludara, two antimetabolite chemotherapeutics. We consider it advantageous to combine TRC102 with Alimta because Alimta is approved in one large market indication (lung cancer) and one orphan drug indication (mesothelioma). Temodar is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat glioblastoma, and Fludara is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat lymphoma and leukemia. In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy.
 
We filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2008, Case Western filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2006, and NCI filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2013, all for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. The IND filed by NCI cross references our IND.
 
Phase 1 ascending dose clinical trials evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of TRC102 were completed with Alimta in patients with advanced solid tumors, with Fludara in patients with hematologic malignancy and with Temodar in patients with solid tumors. In each trial, TRC102 was tolerable with the companion chemotherapeutic, and demonstrated signs of activity.  One patient treated with TRC102 and Alimta had a partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and remained in our clinical trial without cancer progression for 14 months. In addition, 14 patients had stable disease for three or more cycles including patients with squamous cell lung cancer (three patients), epithelial ovarian cancer (three patients), colorectal cancer (two patients), non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (one patient), pancreatic cancer (one patient), prostate cancer (one patient), endometrial cancer (one patient), head and neck cancer (one patient) and breast cancer (one patient). These data were published in Investigational New Drugs in 2012. Case Western reported data from a trial of intravenous TRC102 given in combination with Fludara in a Phase 1 clinical trial that were published in Oncotarget in 2017. Anti-tumor activity, including partial response, was noted in patients with lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including patients treated previously with Fludara. TRC102 combined with Fludara was safe and well tolerated. Hematologic toxicity was comparable to single agent Fludara and activity appeared to correlate with increased levels of DNA damage.  Case Western reported data from a trial of TRC102 given intravenously in combination with Temodar in a Phase 1 clinical trial at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015. Anti-tumor activity was noted in patients with ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
 
The following table summarizes certain key information regarding ongoing clinical trials of TRC102 in cancer patients:
 
 
 | | | Companion | Design 
------+----------------------------+---------+--------------------+--------------------------------------
Phase | Indication | Sponsor | Treatment | (Number of Patients) 
2 | Mesothelioma | NCI | Alimta | Single arm Phase 2 portion (14 total)
1 | Solid Tumors | NCI | Almita + Cisplatin | Dose escalation (44) 
1 | Solid Tumors and Lymphomas | NCI | Temodar | Dose escalation (65) 
1 | Lung Cancer | NCI | Chemoradiation | Dose escalation (15) 

 
The NCI reported data from the Phase 1 study of TRC102 in combination with Temodar in relapsed solid tumors and lymphoma patients at ASCO in 2017. There were no pharmacologic interactions between the two drugs and TRC102 target concentrations were achieved. Based on partial responses in patients with ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and KRAS-positive colorectal cancer, the NCI decided to enroll expansion cohorts in each of these tumor types at the recommended Phase 2 oral dose of TRC102.  The authors concluded that the combination of Temodar and TRC102 is active, and DNA damage response markers (Rad51, ϒ-H2AX and/or pNbs1) were induced in four of five paired colonic biopsies, indicating DNA damage following treatment.
 
The combination of TRC102 and Temodar was assessed in a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent glioblastoma that was reported at the Society for Neuro-Oncology annual meeting in November 2018.  The combination of Temodar and TRC102 was tolerable, but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating objective responses by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria in the 19 enrolled patients, most of whom were treated at Cleveland Clinic.  Two patients (10.5%) demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit and met the secondary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) beyond 6 months.  Both patients who demonstrated PFS for more than 11 months were alive over 30 months following treatment initiation with TRC102 and Temodar for recurrent glioblastoma.  PFS of greater than 11 months was associated with N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase expression, a biomarker that initiates the BER pathway of resistance that is inhibited by TRC102. Efforts to identify whether DNA glycosylase expression can be used as a predictive biomarker of TRC102 activity are expected to continue in ongoing TRC102 trials in 2019.

Our Third Product Candidate – TRC253 
 
TRC253 Development
 
TRC253 (formerly JNJ-63576253) is a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule discovered and developed by Janssen that is a potent, high affinity competitive inhibitor of the wild type androgen receptor (AR) and multiple AR mutations, including the F877L mutation, and is under development for the treatment of men with prostate cancer. The AR F877L mutation results in an alteration in the ligand binding domain that confers resistance to current AR inhibitors, including Xtandi® (enzalutamide) and Erleada (apalutamide).  
 
Activation of the AR is crucial for the growth of prostate cancer at all stages of the disease. Therapies targeting the AR have demonstrated clinical efficacy by extending time to disease progression, and in some cases, the survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, resistance to these agents is often observed and several molecular mechanisms of resistance have been identified, including amplification, overexpression, alternative splicing, or mutation of the AR.  
 
Initial clinical development of TRC253 is focusing on the safety and activity in patients with resistance to current AR inhibitors, by specifically enrolling patients with mutations in the AR ligand binding domain, including F877L. AR mutations were identified using circulating tumor DNA in the Phase 1 portion of the trial, that determined the recommended Phase 2 dose of TRC253. The Phase 2 portion of the trial began in August 2018, and will enroll two cohorts, one will consist of 15 patients with the F877L mutation and one cohort will consist of 30 patients with other mutations conferring resistance to Xtandi or other drugs. We completed the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 trial in July 2018 and expect to complete the Phase 2 portion of the trial in 2020, due to a slower than expected enrollment resulting from a lower than expected frequency of the F877L mutation targeted by TRC253 among metastatic prostate cancer patients. TRC253 also potently inhibits signaling through the wild type AR and may also be developed in earlier lines of treatment as a single agent or in combination with drugs approved in prostate cancer.
 
Other Product Candidates
 
TJ004309
 TJ004309, is a novel, humanized antibody against CD73, an ecto-enzyme expressed on stromal cells and tumors that converts extracellular AMP to adenosine, which is highly immunosuppressive. In December 2018, we submitted an IND application with the U.S. FDA for the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with advanced solid tumors, which was cleared by the FDA in January 2019.  TJ004309 is expected to begin clinical testing in the United States in the first half of 2019 in a trial to assess safety and preliminary signs of efficacy as a single agent and when combined with a PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. We expect to report Phase 1 data in 2020.

 The TJ004309 Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party, or for safety reasons related to TJ004309.  I-Mab may also terminate the TJ004309 Agreement if we cause certain delays in completing a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, I-Mab may terminate the TJ004309 Agreement for any reason 
 16

within 90 days following the completion of the first Phase 1 clinical study, in which case we would be entitled to a minimum termination fee of $9.0 million, or following the completion of the first Phase 2 clinical study, in which case we would be entitled to a pre-specified termination fee of $15.0 million and either a low double-digit percentage of non-royalty consideration up to $35.0 million that I-Mab may receive as part of a license to a third party, or an additional payment of $35.0 million if TJ004309 is approved for marketing outside Greater China before a third party license is executed, in addition to a double digit percentage of royalty consideration. 
 Pursuant to the Bispecific Agreement, we and I-Mab may mutually select through a JSC up to five of I-Mab’s bispecific antibody product candidates within a five-year period for development and commercialization in North America. 
 For each product candidate selected by the JSC for development under the Bispecific Agreement, I-Mab will be responsible for and bear the costs for IND-enabling studies and establishing manufacturing for the product candidate, while we will be responsible for and bear the costs of filing an IND and conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies, and we will be responsible for and will share equally with I-Mab in the costs of conducting Phase 3 or pivotal clinical studies, in each case within North America. Subject to I-Mab’s right to co-promote an approved product candidate, we will be responsible for commercializing any approved product candidates in North America, and we will share profits and losses equally with I-Mab in North America. We would also be entitled to tiered low single digit royalties on net sales of product candidates in the EU and Japan.
 At any time prior to completing the first pivotal clinical study for a product candidate or if I-Mab ceases to support development costs or pay its portion of Phase 3 clinical study costs for a product candidate or the JSC decides to cease development over our objections after initiating Phase 3 clinical studies, we will have an option to obtain an exclusive license to such product candidate in all territories except Greater China and Korea, and any other territories in which I-Mab previously licensed rights to a third party subject to our right of first refusal for any licenses I-Mab may grant to third-parties.  
 If we exercise the option, we would assume sole responsibility for developing and commercializing the product candidate in the licensed territory, and in lieu of profit or loss sharing with I-Mab with respect to such product candidate, we would owe I-Mab pre-specified upfront and milestone payments and royalties on net sales, with the payments and royalties escalating depending on the phase of development the product candidate reached at the time we obtained the exclusive license: (i) if before IND-enabling studies and the preparation of the CMC activities of the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $10.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $90.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal study, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the mid-single digits on annual net sales; (ii) if after IND submission but before completion of a Phase 1a study of the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $25.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $125.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal study, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the high single digits on annual net sales; (iii) if after completion of a Phase 1a study but before completion of Phase 2 proof of concept study for the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $50.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $250.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal study, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the low double digits on annual net sales; and (iv) if after completion of Phase 2 proof of concept study and before completion of a pivotal study for the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $80.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $420.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal study, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the high-teens on annual net sales.
 Each party agreed that for a specified period of time, it would not develop or license to or from any third party any bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting the same two biological targets as those of any selected product candidates under the Bispecific Agreement.
 If development of any selected product candidates is terminated by a decision of the JSC, all rights to the product candidate will revert to I-Mab, subject to our rights to obtain an exclusive license in certain circumstances.  If development is terminated after submission of an IND and prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical studies or after initiating Phase 3 clinical studies and with our concurrence, we would be entitled to tiered low single digit royalties on net sales of the product candidate in North America, the EU and Japan.
 The Bispecific Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party, or with respect to any selected product candidate, for safety reasons related to that product candidate.
 
License Agreement with Ambrx, Inc.
 
In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Ambrx, Inc., for the development and commercialization of TRC105 in Greater China. 
 
In consideration of the rights granted to Ambrx under the agreement, we received a one-time upfront fee of $3.0 million. In February 2019, following discussions between us and Ambrx regarding Ambrx’s progress towards initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial of 
 17

TRC105 in China, Ambrx notified us that it had elected to terminate the license agreement, resulting in all rights to TRC105 in Greater China reverting to us.
 License Agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.
 
In September 2016, we entered into a strategic licensing collaboration with Janssen for two novel oncology assets from Janssen’s early oncology development portfolio. The agreement, as amended, grants us the rights to develop TRC253 (formerly JNJ-63576253), a novel small molecule high affinity competitive inhibitor of wild type androgen receptor (AR Mutant Program) and multiple AR mutant receptors which display drug resistance to approved treatments, which is intended for the treatment of men with prostate cancer, and TRC694 (formerly JNJ-6420694), a novel, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of NF-kB inducing kinase (the NIK Program and, together with the AR Mutant Program, the Programs), which is intended for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies, including myeloma. Following completion of the pre-clinical development of TRC694, in February 2019, we determined the compound did not warrant further development and issued written notice to terminate the agreement with respect to the TRC694 NIK Program, thereby returning TRC694 and all rights thereto to Janssen.
 
Janssen maintains an option, which is exercisable until 90 days after we demonstrate clinical proof of concept with respect to the AR Mutant Program, to regain the rights to the licensed intellectual property and to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize the compounds and certain other specified intellectual property developed under the AR Mutant Program. If Janssen exercises the option, Janssen will be obligated to pay us (i) a one-time option exercise fee of $45.0 million; (ii) regulatory and commercial based milestone payments totaling up to $137.5 million upon achievement of specified events; and (iii) royalties in the low single digits on annual net sales of AR Mutant Program products. If Janssen does not exercise the option, we would then have the right to retain worldwide development and commercialization rights to the AR Mutant Program, in which case, we would be obligated to pay to Janssen (x) development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $45.0 million upon achievement of specified events, and (y) royalties in the low single digits based on annual net sales of AR Mutant Program products, subject to certain specified reductions.
 
The license agreement may be terminated for uncured breach (including failure to satisfy specified development and spending obligations we have in relation to the Programs), bankruptcy, or the failure or inability to demonstrate clinical proof of concept with respect to a particular Program during specified timeframes. In addition, the license and agreement will automatically terminate with respect to the AR Mutant Program, upon Janssen exercising its option in respect of the AR Mutant Program and making payment of the option exercise fee to us or, if Janssen does not exercise the option, upon the expiration of all our payment obligations to Janssen with respect of the AR Mutant Program. We may also terminate the agreement in its entirety without cause, subject to specified conditions.
 
License Agreement with Santen
 
In March 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Santen, under which we granted Santen an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, information and know-how related to TRC105, or the TRC105 Technology. Under the agreement, as amended, Santen is permitted to use, develop, manufacture and commercialize TRC105 products for ophthalmology indications, excluding systemic treatment of ocular tumors. Santen also has the right to grant sublicenses to affiliates and third party collaborators, provided such sublicenses are consistent with the terms of our agreement. In the event Santen sublicenses any of its rights under the agreement relating to the TRC105 Technology, Santen will be obligated to pay us a portion of any upfront and certain milestone payments received under such sublicense. 
 
Santen has sole responsibility for funding, developing, seeking regulatory approval for and commercializing TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology. In the event that Santen fails to meet certain commercial diligence obligations, we will have the option to co-promote TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology in the United States with Santen. If we exercise this option, we will pay Santen a percentage of certain development expenses, and we will receive a percentage of profits from sales of the licensed products in the ophthalmology field in the United States, but will not also receive royalties on such sales. 
 
We will own any and all discoveries and inventions made solely by us under the agreement, and Santen will own any and all discoveries and inventions made solely by Santen under the agreement. We will jointly own discoveries and inventions made jointly by us and Santen. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the patents licensed to Santen under the agreement, and Santen has the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the patents it controls that are related to TRC105 and the patents owned jointly by us and Santen. Subject to certain limitations, if the party with the first right to enforce a patent fails to timely do so, the other party will have the right to enforce such patent. 
 
In consideration of the rights granted to Santen under the agreement, we received a one-time upfront fee of $10.0 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to a total of $155.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, of which $20.0 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities, $52.5 million relates to the submission of certain regulatory filings and receipt of certain regulatory approvals and $82.5 million relates to commercialization activities and the 
 18

achievement of specified levels of product sales. If TRC105 products are successfully commercialized in the field of ophthalmology, Santen will be required to pay us tiered royalties on net sales ranging from high single digits to low teens, depending on the volume of sales, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. In addition, Santen will reimburse us for all royalties due by us under certain third party agreements with respect to the use, manufacture or commercialization of TRC105 products in the field of ophthalmology by Santen and its affiliates and sublicensees. Royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis through the later of the expiration of our patent rights applicable to the TRC105 products in a given country or 12 years after the first commercial sale of the first TRC105 product commercially launched in such country. As of December 31, 2018, $10.0 million of the development milestones have been achieved and received in accordance with the agreement. 
 
Santen may unilaterally terminate this agreement in its entirety, or on a country-by-country basis, for any reason or for no reason upon at least 90 days’ notice to us (or 30 days’ notice if after a change in control). Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or dissolution or for the other party’s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured 90 days (or 30 days with respect to a payment breach) after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect until the termination of Santen’s payment obligations. 
 License Agreement with Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Health Research Inc.
 
In November 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Health Research Inc. and Roswell Park Cancer Institute, referred to collectively as RPCI. Under the agreement, as amended, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights controlled by RPCI related to endoglin antibodies, including TRC105, and their therapeutic uses, which we refer to as the RPCI Technology, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain know-how controlled by RPCI related to the RPCI Technology. Under the agreement, we are permitted to use, manufacture, develop and commercialize products utilizing the RPCI Technology in all fields of use. In addition, we are permitted to sublicense our rights under the agreement to third parties.
 
Under the agreement, we are responsible for development and commercialization activities for products utilizing the RPCI Technology, and we are obligated to use all commercially reasonable efforts to bring a product utilizing the RPCI Technology to market timely and efficiently.
 
In consideration of the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid a one-time upfront fee to RPCI. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $6.4 million upon the achievement of certain milestones for products utilizing the RPCI Technology, including TRC105, of which approximately $1.4 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities and $5.0 million relates to certain regulatory filings and approvals. Pursuant to an amendment entered into in November 2009, we may also be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $6.4 million upon the achievement of certain milestones for products utilizing a patent owned by us covering humanized endoglin antibodies, including TRC205, a humanized and deimmunized endoglin antibody, of which approximately $1.4 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities and $5.0 million relates to certain regulatory filings and approvals. Upon commercialization, we will be required to pay RPCI mid-single-digit royalties based on net sales of products utilizing the RPCI Technology in each calendar quarter, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. In addition, pursuant to the amendment entered into in November 2009, we will be required to pay RPCI low single-digit royalties based on net sales in each calendar quarter of products utilizing our patent covering humanized endoglin antibodies. Our royalty obligations continue until the expiration of the last valid claim in a patent subject to the agreement, which we expect to occur in 2029, based on the patents currently subject to the agreement.
 
We may unilaterally terminate this agreement in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason, upon at least 60 days’ notice to RPCI. RPCI may terminate the agreement if we fail to pay any amount due under the agreement or materially breach the agreement and the breach remains uncured 90 days after receiving notice. In the event of our bankruptcy, the agreement will automatically terminate. Unless otherwise terminated, the agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last valid claim under the patents subject to the agreement.
 License Agreement with Case Western
 In August 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Case Western, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, know-how and other intellectual property controlled by Case Western related to methoxyamine, which we refer to as the TRC102 Technology. Under the agreement, as amended, we have the right to use, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the TRC102 Technology for all mammalian therapeutic uses, and to sublicense these rights.
 Under the agreement, we are generally obligated to use our best efforts to commercialize the TRC102 Technology as soon as possible. We are also required to meet specified diligence milestones, and if we fail to do so and do not cure such failure, Case Western may convert our license into a non-exclusive license or terminate the agreement.
 19

In consideration of the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid a one-time upfront fee to Case Western. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $9.8 million in milestone payments, of which $650,000 relates to the initiation of certain development activities and approximately $9.1 million relates to the submission of certain regulatory filings and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. If products utilizing the TRC102 Technology are successfully commercialized, we will be required to pay Case Western a single-digit royalty on net sales, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. Beginning on the earlier of a specified number of years from the effective date of the agreement and the anniversary of the effective date following the occurrence of a specified event, we will be required to make a minimum annual royalty payment of $75,000, which will be credited against our royalty obligations. In the event we sublicense any of our rights under the agreement relating to the TRC102 Technology, we will be obligated to pay Case Western a portion of certain fees we may receive under the sublicense. Our royalty obligations will continue through the later of (i) the expiration of any orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a product utilizing the TRC102 Technology, (ii) August 2026, or (iii) on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last valid claim under the TRC102 Technology or any patent we receive that is a derivative of the TRC102 Technology.
 We may unilaterally terminate this agreement in its entirety, for any reason or for no reason, upon at least 30 days’ notice to Case Western. If we do so, we will be required to pay Case Western a termination fee. If we fail to pay any amount required under the agreement and do not cure the default within 90 days of receiving notice, Case Western will have the right to convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license or to terminate the agreement entirely. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured 60 days after receiving notice of the breach.
 License Agreement with Lonza Sales AG
 In June 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, under which we obtained a world-wide non-exclusive license to Lonza’s glutamine synthetase gene expression system consisting of cell lines into which TRC105 may be transfected and corresponding patents and applications, which we refer to as the Lonza Technology. Under the agreement, we are permitted to use, develop, manufacture and commercialize TRC105 obtained through use of the Lonza Technology.
 In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we are required to pay Lonza a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of TRC105 product manufactured by Lonza. In the event that we or a strategic partner or collaborator manufactures the product, we will be required to pay Lonza an annual lump sum payment of £75,000, along with a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of the manufactured TRC105 product. In the event that we sublicense our manufacturing rights under the agreement (other than to a strategic partner or collaborator), we will be obligated to pay Lonza an annual lump sum payment of £300,000 per sublicense, along with a low single-digit percentage royalty on the net selling price of the manufactured TRC105 product. If, on a country-by-country basis, the manufacture or sale of the TRC105 product is not protected by a valid claim in a licensed patent, our royalty obligations in such country will decrease and will expire 12 years after the first commercial sale of the product.
 We may unilaterally terminate this agreement for any reason upon at least 60 days’ written notice to Lonza. Either party may terminate the agreement by written notice if the other party commits a breach and, if the breach is curable, does not cure the breach within 30 days of receiving notice from the non-breaching party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement with written notice in the event of the other party’s liquidation or appointment of a receiver. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement continues in effect until the later of the expiration of the last valid claim in a licensed patent or for so long as the know-how subject to the agreement is identified and remains secret and substantial.
 Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with NCI
 We are a party to two Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, or CRADAs, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by NCI, for the development of TRC105 and TRC102 for the treatment of cancer. We entered into the CRADA governing the development of TRC105 in January 2011, or the 2011 CRADA, with NCI’s Center for Cancer Research. We entered into the CRADA governing the development of TRC102 in August 2012. 
 Under the CRADAs, as amended, NCI conducts clinical trials and non-clinical studies of either TRC105 or TRC102. We are responsible for supplying TRC105 for NCI’s activities under the TRC105 CRADAs. Pursuant to the terms of the 2011 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $5,000 per year for support for its research activities, as well as up to $5,000 per year for personnel-related expenses. We may also provide funding for mutually agreed upon animal studies. Under the TRC102 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $20,000 per year per Phase 1 clinical trial and $25,000 per year per Phase 2 clinical trial, as well as expenses incurred by NCI in connection with carrying out its responsibilities under the TRC102 CRADA, up to an aggregate maximum per year of $200,000. We may also provide funding to support assays and other studies, and if NCI supplies TRC102 for additional mutually approved clinical trials beyond the planned trials, we will reimburse NCI for costs associated with manufacturing TRC102. In addition, we made a one-time payment of $20,000 for the initial IND filing and may be required to make additional one-time payments of $10,000 each for 
 20

additional IND filings. Funding for clinical trials beyond those contemplated by the 2011 CRADA or the TRC102 CRADA will be determined in an amendment to the applicable CRADA.
 Under each CRADA, each party individually owns all inventions, data and materials produced solely by its employees in the course of performing research activities pursuant to the CRADA. The parties jointly own any inventions and materials that are jointly produced by employees of both parties. Subject to certain conditions, we have the option under each CRADA to negotiate commercialization licenses from the government to intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice in performance of the CRADA research plan that was developed solely by NCI employees or jointly by us and NCI employees.
 Each CRADA had an original five-year term, with the 2011 CRADA, as amended, expiring on January 28, 2021, and the TRC102 CRADA expiring on August 7, 2020. Each CRADA may be terminated at any time by mutual written consent, and we or NCI may unilaterally terminate any of the CRADAs for any reason or no reason by providing written notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. We therefore rely on various third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates. TRC105 drug substance for our preclinical studies and clinical trials is manufactured by Lonza, a contract manufacturer that also manufactures approved biologic cancer treatments marketed by other companies and is compliant to U.S. and European regulatory standards.
 TRC105 drug substance is produced by Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells developed at Lonza and manufactured using Lonza’s proprietary manufacturing and purification processes. 
 
On February 22, 2017, we entered into a manufacturing agreement, or the Manufacturing Agreement, with Lonza Biologics Tuas Pte Ltd, or Lonza, for the long-term manufacture and supply of registration and commercial batches of TRC105.  
 
Under the Manufacturing Agreement, Lonza has agreed to manufacture TRC105 pursuant to purchase orders and in accordance with the manufacturing specifications agreed upon between us and Lonza. Initially, we are required to purchase and Lonza is obligated to supply certain batches prior to approval of TRC105 by the FDA or EMA. Following regulatory approval, we will be required to purchase and Lonza will be required to supply a minimum number of batches annually. In the event we cancel any purchase orders, we may be obligated to pay certain cancellation fees.  In addition, we are obligated to pay a milestone fee to Lonza upon the earlier of the first approval of TRC105 by the FDA or EMA or our receipt of a complete response letter or non-approvability letter (or equivalent communication) indicating that the rejection of the marketing application was not due to a deficiency in Lonza’s facility, the manufacturing process or services performed by Lonza.
 
The Manufacturing Agreement has an initial term beginning on the effective date and ending on the seventh anniversary of the date of first regulatory approval of TRC105 by the FDA or EMA. The Manufacturing Agreement may be renewed for an additional three years upon the written agreement of both parties no later than the fifth anniversary of the date of first approval by the FDA or EMA. 
 Either party may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement due to a material breach of the Manufacturing Agreement by the other party, subject to prior written notice and a cure period, due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, or due to a force majeure event that prevents performance under the Manufacturing Agreement for at least six months. We may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement, subject to 60 days’ written notice, if we discontinue the TRC105 program, whether due to a notice of non-approval or withdrawal of marketing approval by a regulatory agency or otherwise.  In the event of a termination by us due to discontinuation of the TRC105 program or a termination by Lonza due to our material breach or insolvency or bankruptcy, we would be obligated to pay to Lonza certain batch cancellation and/or early termination fees. 
 TRC105 drug product is produced by an FDA-registered contract manufacturer. Drug product is filter-sterilized and aseptically filled into single-use pharmaceutical grade vials and stoppered using an automated filling machine. The final drug product is stored refrigerated until used.
 TRC102 drug substance is manufactured through a standard chemical synthesis and may be obtained from multiple manufacturers.
 TRC253 drug substance is manufactured through a standard chemical synthesis by an experienced contract manufacturer and is currently being produced at clinical scale. 
 21

TJ004309 is supplied to us from a contract manufacturer contracted by I-Mab as I-Mab is responsible for the supply of TJ004309 and all related drug supply activities under the terms of the TJ004309 Agreement.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive, and we and our collaborators face competition with respect to each of our product candidates in their target indications. Many of the entities developing and marketing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
 If our product candidates are approved, they will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will include its efficacy, safety profile, price, method of administration and level of promotional activity.
 Oncology Therapies
 We are developing TRC105 to be used in combination with VEGF or PD-1 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. If TRC105 is approved, it could compete with other non-VEGF angiogenesis inhibitors in development, including some that also target the endoglin pathway and have the potential to be combined with VEGF inhibitors or used independently of VEGF inhibitors to inhibit angiogenesis. Amgen, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly and Company, MedImmune LLC, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Roche AG are each developing non-VEGF angiogenesis inhibitors, which are in various phases of clinical development. In addition, drugs have recently been approved or are being developed that target other oncologic pathways, including immune surveillance targets, that may decrease the need for treatments like TRC105 that target angiogenesis.
 We are developing TRC102 to be used in combination with alkylating chemotherapeutics (including Temodar) and antimetabolite chemotherapeutics (including Alimta and Fludara) for the treatment of cancer. If TRC102 is approved, it could compete with other inhibitors of DNA repair. Tesaro, Inc., Clovis Oncology and Astra Zeneca each market inhibitors of DNA repair that work by a mechanism of action that is distinct from that of TRC102. In addition to the therapies mentioned above, there are many generic chemotherapeutics and other regimens commonly used to treat various types of cancer, including soft tissue sarcoma and glioblastoma.
 We are developing TRC253 for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. If TRC253 is approved, it could compete with other androgen receptor inhibitors such as Xtandi, ODM-201 and Erleada. In addition to the therapies mentioned above, there are many generic chemotherapeutics and other agents commonly used to treat prostate cancer.
 We are developing TJ004309 for the treatment of solid tumors, including bladder cancer. If TJ004309 is approved, it could compete with other anti-CD73 immunotherapies including CD73 antibodies already in clinical development sponsored by Bristol Meyers Squibb, AstraZeneca, and Corvus Pharmaceuticals. 
 Wet AMD Therapies
 Our partner, Santen, is developing DE-122 for the treatment of wet AMD and other eye diseases. If DE-122 is approved as a single agent, it would compete with currently marketed VEGF inhibitors, including Avastin and Lucentis (marketed by Genentech in the United States), and Eylea (marketed by Regeneron in the United States), which are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors as the standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. In addition, DE-122 could face competition from other VEGF inhibitors in development, such as Allergan’s VEGF inhibitor, DARPin, and Novartis’ brolucizumab which are both in late stage clinical development in wet AMD.
 22

Commercialization
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights for our oncology product candidates (subject to certain rights held by Janssen for TRC253 and I-Mab for TJ004309), while Santen holds worldwide commercialization rights for our endoglin antibodies, including TRC105, in the field of ophthalmology. If any of our product candidates are approved in oncology indications, our plan is to build an oncology-focused specialty sales force in North America to support their commercialization and seek a partner to support commercialization outside of North America. We believe that a specialty sales force will be sufficient to target key prescribing physicians in oncology. We currently do not have any sales or marketing capabilities or experience. We plan to establish the required capabilities within an appropriate time frame ahead of any product approval and commercialization to support a product launch. 
Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our protein therapeutics, novel biological discoveries, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See “Government Regulation.”
 Our patenting strategy is focused on our protein therapeutics. We seek composition of matter and method of treatment patents for each such protein in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection with respect to companion diagnostic methods and compositions and treatments for targeted patient populations. We have sought patent protection alone or jointly with our collaborators, as dictated by our collaboration agreements.
 Our patent estate as of December 31, 2018, on a worldwide basis, includes 19 issued patents/allowed applications and 14 pending patent applications in the United States and 60 issued patents/allowed applications and 104 pending patent applications outside the United States with pending and issued claims relating to our product candidates. Forty-four (44) of our issued US and foreign patents and allowed applications cover antibodies to endoglin and uses thereof that we have selected as the core focus of our development approach. These figures include in-licensed patents and patent applications to which we hold exclusive commercial rights in non-ophthalmologic fields of use.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to our protein therapeutic candidates will expire on dates ranging from 2019 to 2038, exclusive of possible patent term extensions. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 National and international patent laws concerning protein therapeutics remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States, Europe or other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be 
 23

commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below:

The expected expiration date for patents issuing from these applications is 2033, exclusive of possible patent term extensions.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation
 The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our product candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, in addition to the FDA’s implementing regulations. We expect TRC105 to be regulated by the FDA as a biologic, which requires the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. We expect our small molecule product candidate TRC102 to be regulated as a drug and subject to New Drug Application, or NDA, requirements, which are substantially similar to the BLA requirements discussed below. Manufacturers of our product candidates may also be subject to state regulation. Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution.
 The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish that the biological product is “safe, pure and potent,” which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license which is the approval necessary to market a biologic therapeutic product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Nonclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lends themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND on clinical hold because of its concerns about the drug candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol included in the IND. The FDA can also place the IND on clinical hold at any time 
 25

during drug development for safety concerns related to the investigational drug or to the class of products to which it belongs. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, and monitor the study until completed.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in a limited number of patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects for indications other than oncology. The drug candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.
 Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks.
 Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 The FDA and an IND sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in a BLA or NDA. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. A SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. For certain types of protocols, including carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3 protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim, the FDA has agreed under its performance goals associated with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, to provide a written response on most protocols within 45 days of receipt. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goals, and additional FDA questions and resolution of issues leading up to a SPA agreement may result in the overall SPA process being much longer, if an agreement is reached at all.
 The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the drug candidate for a proposed indication. Under the PDUFA, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual program fees for approved products, can be substantial. The fees typically increase each year. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA’s established goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard BLA applications within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a drug candidate within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility complies with cGMPs. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, 
 26

or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, created a pathway for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products licensed under the PHSA. Also under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. 
 Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Orphan Drug Act
 TRC105 has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, which includes angiosarcoma in the US and EU. The United States Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug.
 Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the United States, including in the European Union and Japan. The orphan legislation in the European Union is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if sponsors complete a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the European Medicines Agency. Orphan legislation in Japan similarly provides for ten years of marketing exclusivity for drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases and conditions.
 27

Exclusivity
 TRC105 and TRC205, as new biological products, will benefit, if approved, from the data exclusivity provisions legislated in the United States, the European Union and Japan. All three regions effectively provide a period of data exclusivity to innovator biologic products. U.S. legislation provides a 12-year period of data exclusivity from the date of first licensure of a reference biologic product. EU legislation provides a period of 10 to 11 years and Japan legislation provides a period of 8 years during which companies cannot be granted approval as generic drugs to approved biologic therapies. Protection from generic competition is also available for new chemical entities, including potentially the small molecule TRC102, in the United States for 5 years, in the European Union for 10 to 11 years and in Japan for 8 years.
 Exclusivity in the European Union
 The European Union has led the way among the International Council for Harmonisation regions in establishing a regulatory framework for biosimilar products. The marketing authorization of generic medicinal products and similar biological medicinal products are governed in the European Union by Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC (2001). Unlike generic medicinal products, which only need to demonstrate bioequivalence to an authorized reference product, similar biological medicinal products are required to submit preclinical and clinical data, the type and quantity of which is dictated by class and product specific guidelines. In order to submit a marketing authorization for a similar biological medicinal product, the reference product must have been authorized for marketing in the European Union for at least 8 years. Biosimilars can only be authorized for use once the period of data exclusivity on the biological reference medicine has expired. In general, this means that the biological reference medicine must have been authorized for at least 10 years before a similar biological medicine can be made available by another company. The 10-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 if, during the first 8 years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison to existing therapies.
 Many EU countries have banned interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products to ensure adequate characterization of the safety profile of the biosimilar and to enable comparison to that of reference product.
 Exclusivity in Japan
 In 2009, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency, or PMDA, issued the first Japanese guidance on biosimilars. The guideline (currently available only in Japanese), which shares common key features to EU guidelines, outlines the nonclinical, clinical and CMC requirements for biosimilar applications and describes the review process, naming conventions and application fees. 
 Japan does not grant exclusivity to pharmaceutical products; however, the country does have a Post Marketing Surveillance, or PMS, system that affects the timing of generic entry and, in effect, provides a period of market exclusivity to innovator products. This system allows safety data to be acquired for each product. A PMS period is set for most of new drug approvals, and until this period is over, generic companies cannot submit their applications for drug approvals as generic drugs. Recently, this period was extended to 8 years for all new drug approvals. Japan’s regulations do not allow currently for interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products.
 Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and biologics, and/or provide for the approval of a drug or biologic on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial.
 28

Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may decline to issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels, for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 29

Healthcare Reform
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, including our product candidates if approved. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. 
Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we or our collaborators must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we or our collaborators may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be approved by the competent national health authority and by independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. A favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 In China, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) monitors and supervises the administration of pharmaceutical products, as well as medical devices and equipment.  In order to conduct clinical trials in China a clinical trial application must be submitted and approved by the CFDA.  When clinical trials have been completed, an applicant must apply to the CFDA for approval of a new drug application. The CFDA, the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE), and the Drug Inspection Institution will then conduct reviews and on-site inspections. The CFDA determines whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive evaluation opinions produced by the reviews and on-site inspections. We or our collaborators must obtain approval of new drug applications before our product candidates can be manufactured and sold in the Chinese market.  In addition, all facilities and techniques used in the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale in China must be operated in conformity with good manufacturing practice guidelines as established by the CFDA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in the termination of manufacturing and significant fines.
