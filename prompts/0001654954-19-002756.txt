  Item 1. Business
 
  General
 
 We are an international renewable fuels and biochemicals company focused on the production of advanced renewable fuels and chemicals through the acquisition, development, and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace traditional petroleum-based products primarily through the conversion of first-generation ethanol and biodiesel plants into advanced biorefineries. We operate in two reportable geographic segments: “North America” and “India.” For revenue and other information regarding our operating segments, see Note 12- Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
  We were incorporated in Nevada in 2006.
 
 We own and operate a 60 million gallon per year ethanol production facility located in Keyes, California (the “Keyes Plant”). In addition to ethanol, the Keyes Plant produces Wet Distillers Grains (“WDG”), Distillers Corn Oil (“DCO”), and Condensed Distillers Solubles (“CDS”), all of which are sold to local dairies and feedlots as animal feed. The primary feedstock used for the production of low carbon renewable fuel ethanol at the Keyes Plant is number two yellow dent corn. The corn is procured by J.D. Heiskell from various Midwestern grain facilities and shipped via Union Pacific Rail Road to an unloading facility adjacent to the Keyes Plant.
 
 During the third quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with a major industrial gas company, The Linde Group (“Linde”), to sell carbon dioxide (“CO2”) produced at the Keyes Plant to Linde for conversion into Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). In the fourth quarter of 2018, we finished purchasing a 5.2-acre parcel of land next to the Keyes Plant and leased the land to Linde to build a gas compression plant and piping structure to connect to the CO2 produced at the adjacent Keyes Plant (the “Linde CO2 Project”). The Linde CO2 Project is expected to add incremental income for the North America segment when construction is completed in late 2019.

 We also leased a site in Riverbank, CA, near the Keyes Plant, where we plan to utilize biomass-to-fuel technology that we have licensed from LanzaTech Technology (“LanzaTech”) and InEnTec Technology (“InEnTec”) to build a cellulosic ethanol production facility (the “Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility”) capable of converting local California surplus biomass – principally agricultural waste – into ultra-low carbon renewable cellulosic ethanol. By producing ultra-low carbon renewable cellulosic ethanol, we expect to capture higher value D3 cellulosic renewable identification numbers (RINs) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) carbon credits. D3 RINs have a higher value in the marketplace than D6 RINs due to D3 RINs’ relative scarcity and mandated pricing formula from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”).
 
 During 2018, Aemetis Biogas, LLC. (“ABGL”) was formed to launch a biogas education and marketing program to local dairies in Central California, many of whom are already customers of the distillers’ grain produced by the Keyes Plant. ABGL currently has 14 signed participation agreements and two fully executed leases with nearby dairies at the Keyes Plant in order to capture their volatile methane, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, primarily from their wastewater lagoons.  Biogas is a blend of methane along with CO2 and other impurities that can be captured from dairies, landfills and other sources.  After a gas cleanup and compression process, biogas can be converted into bio-methane, which is a direct replacement of petroleum natural gas and can be transported in existing natural gas pipelines. We plan to capture biogas from multiple dairies and pipe the gas to a centralized location at our Keyes Plant where we will clean the biogas into bio-methane. The bio-methane can be used in the Keyes Plant to displace petroleum natural gas, or can be sold at retail to trucking companies or injected into the utility natural gas pipeline to be utilized in the transportation sector to displace diesel in trucks.  The environmental benefits of the Aemetis Biogas project are potentially significant because dairy biogas has a negative carbon intensity under the California LCFS and conversion into bio-methane for displacement of diesel in trucks is a valuable use of biogas.  The biogas produced by ABGL will also receive D3 RINS under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) which have a higher value than the current D6 RINS we receive in the traditional ethanol market.
 
 During 2017, Goodland Advanced Fuels, Inc. (GAFI) was formed to acquire land, buildings and process equipment in Goodland, Kansas. At acquisition, the assets were purchased for $15.4 million and provided a base for the construction and development of a next generation biofuel facility. GAFI entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Third Eye Capital Corporation (“Third Eye Capital”). GAFI, the Company and its subsidiary Aemetis Advanced Product Keyes (AAPK) also entered into separate Intercompany Revolving Notes, pursuant to which GAFI may lend a portion of the proceeds of the Revolving Loan under the Note Purchase Agreement. Aemetis has the power to direct the activities of GAFI and has future plans to construct an advanced biofuels facility at the Goodland site.
 
 We also own and operate a biodiesel production facility in Kakinada, India (the “Kakinada Plant”) with a nameplate capacity of 150 thousand metric tons per year, which is equal to about 50 million gallons per year. We believe the Kakinada Plant is one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in India on a nameplate capacity basis. The Kakinada Plant is capable of processing a variety of vegetable oil and animal fat waste feedstocks into biodiesel that meet international product standards. The Kakinada Plant also distills the crude glycerin byproduct from the biodiesel refining process into refined glycerin, which is sold to the pharmaceutical, personal care, paint, adhesive and other industries.
 
  Strategy
 
 Key elements of our strategy include:
 
  North America
 
 Leverage technology for the development and production of additional advanced biofuels and renewable chemicals. We hold certain exclusive rights to the LanzaTech and InEnTec technologies (the “LanzaTech and InEnTec Technologies”) for the conversion of agricultural waste, forest waste, dairy waste, and construction and demolition waste into an ultra-low carbon renewable fuel referred to in the biofuels industry as “cellulosic ethanol”. We intend to utilize this technology to produce cellulosic ethanol from agricultural biomass waste abundantly available from orchard waste wood and nutshells in the California Central Valley. We have initiated a project to adopt the LanzaTech and InEnTec Technologies at the Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility. Our first phase has an estimated twelve million gallons per year nameplate capacity. We intend to expand the production facility to an estimated 36 million gallons per year nameplate capacity, and build additional plants in California to utilize the estimated 1.6 tons of waste orchard wood, as well as other waste wood and nutshell feedstocks. We continue to evaluate new technology and develop technology under our existing patents, and are conducting research and development to produce renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels from renewable feedstocks. Our objective is to continue to commercialize our portfolio of technologies and expand the adoption of these advanced biofuels and bio-chemicals technologies.

 Diversify and expand revenue and cash flow by continuing to develop and adopt value-added by-product processing systems and optimize other systems in our existing plants. In April 2012, we installed a DCO extraction unit at the Keyes Plant and began extracting corn oil for sale into the livestock feed market. During 2014, we installed a second oil extraction system to further improve corn oil yields from this process. During 2017, we entered into agreements to sell substantially all of the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced at the Keyes Plant to a leading industrial gas supplier who is building a liquid CO2 capture plant adjacent to the Keyes Plant. During 2018, we entered into an agreement with Mitsubishi Chemical to install a membrane dehydration system at the Keyes Plant in order to reduce natural gas usage and lower the carbon intensity of the ethanol produced at the plant (thereby increasing the value of the ethanol). We continue to evaluate and, as allowed by available financing and free cash flow from operations, adopt additional value-added processes that decrease costs and increase the value of the ethanol, distillers grain, corn oil and CO2 produced at the Keyes Plant.
 
 Leverage our position as a plant operator to develop additional streams of revenues and profitability. In December 2018, we leveraged our relationship with central valley dairy farmers by signing two leases and raised funds to construct dairy digesters that produce and send methane by pipeline to our Keyes Plant. We are currently signing additional dairies, and plan to have participating agreements and signed leases with 16 dairies for the construction of the biogas pipeline. Additionally, we continue to evaluate technologies from our existing and planned operations for the development of the property in Goodland, KS.
 
 Acquire, license our technologies to, or joint venture with other ethanol and biodiesel plants. There are approximately 210 operating ethanol plants and more than one hundred biodiesel plants in the U.S., as well as biofuels plants in Brazil, Argentina, India and elsewhere in the world that could be upgraded to expand revenues and improve their cash flow using technology commercially deployed or licensed by us. After developing and commercially demonstrating technologies at the Keyes, Kakinada and/or new Riverbank plants, we will evaluate on an opportunistic basis the benefit of acquiring ownership stakes in other biofuel production facilities and entering into joint venture or licensing agreements with other ethanol, renewable diesel or renewable jet fuel facilities.
 
 Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive value opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of technologies that would be accretive to earnings.
 
  India
 
 Capitalize on recent policy changes by the Government of India. We plan to continue to pursue the traditional bulk and transportation biodiesel markets in India, which may become more economically attractive as a result of potential changes to government tax structures and policies, as well as new marketing channels that may open as a result changes to government policy changes. The rationalization of indirect taxation by the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (the “GST”), biodiesel sales under government oil marketing company (“Government Oil Marketing Company”) contracts and contracts with major oil consumers are expected to become more readily available.
 
 Diversify our feedstocks from India. We designed our Kakinada Plant with the capability to produce biodiesel from multiple feedstocks. In 2009, we began to produce biodiesel from non-refined palm oil (NRPO). During 2014, we further diversified our feedstock with the introduction of animal oils and fats, which we used for the production of biodiesel to be sold into the European markets. In 2017 and 2018, we used refined, bleached & deodorized Palm Stearin (RBD Palm Stearin), which is derived from refining palm oil from crude and was imported from Indonesia. Additionally, the Kakinada Plant is capable of producing biodiesel from used cooking oil (“UCO”); however, the importation of UCO is not currently allowed in India, and as a result, we are looking for a local supply source of UCO to expand our feedstock diversity. In 2018, we completed construction of a pretreatment unit at the Kakinada Plant to convert high free fatty acid (“FFA”) feedstocks into oil that can be used to produce biodiesel.
 
 Develop and commercially deploy technologies to produce high-margin products. During 2018, we upgraded the plant processes to allow for the processing of high FFA feedstocks, available at lower cost than our traditional feedstocks. We plan to continue investing in the conversion of lower quality, waste oils into higher value biofuels, including renewable diesel. The technologies for this conversion process may be licensed from third parties or internally developed.
 
 Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive earnings opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, or enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of accretive earnings business opportunities.

  2018 Highlights
 
  North America
 
 During 2018, we produced four products at the Keyes Plant:  denatured fuel ethanol, WDG, DCO, and CDS.  We sold 100% of the ethanol and WDG produced to J.D. Heiskell pursuant to a Purchase Agreement established with J.D. Heiskell (the “Heiskell Purchase Agreement”).  J.D. Heiskell in turn sells 100% of our ethanol to Kinergy Marketing LLC (“Kinergy”) and 100% of our WDG to A.L. Gilbert Co. (“A.L. Gilbert”), a local feed and grain business. We sell DCO directly to local animal feedlots (primarily poultry) as well as other feed mills for use in various animal feed products. Smaller amounts of CDS were sold to various local third parties as an animal feed supplement.  
 
  The following table sets forth information about our production and sales of ethanol and its by-products in 2018 and 2017:
 
 
 | 2018 | 2017 | % Change
----------------------------+--------+--------+---------
Ethanol | | | 
Gallons Sold (in thousands) | 65,596 | 60,774 | 7.9% 
Average Sales Price/Gallon | $1.74 | $1.75 | -0.6% 
WDG | | | 
Tons Sold (in thousands) | 424 | 407 | 4.2% 
Average Sales Price/Ton | $76.38 | $64.93 | 17.6% 


 
 Ethanol pricing for sales to J.D. Heiskell is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement between Kinergy and us, and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area as published by the Oil Price Information Service (“OPIS”), as well as quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with numerous fuel blenders.  The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement between A.L. Gilbert and us, and is generally determined in reference to the local price of dry distillers grains (“DDG”), corn, and other protein feedstuffs.
  
  India
 
  In 2018, we produced two products at the Kakinada Plant: biodiesel and refined glycerin. Crude glycerin produced as a by-product of the production of biodiesel was further processed into refined glycerin. After installation of the pretreatment unit, we can convert high-FFA oil into a renewable oil feedstock that may be sold to biodiesel plants in India or exported to foreign plants to use for the production of biodiesel, renewable diesel and/or jet fuel.
 
  The following table sets forth information about our production and sales of biodiesel and refined glycerin in 2018 and 2017:

  Competition
 
  North America
 
 According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (the “EIA”), there were approximately 210 operating commercial ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with a combined nameplate production of approximately 17 billion gallons per year at the end of 2018. The EIA short-term U.S. ethanol production forecast for 2019 is approximately 15.9 billion gallons. The production of ethanol is a commodity-based business where producers compete on the basis of price. The production of ethanol is a commodity-based business where producers compete on the basis of price. We sell ethanol into the Northern California market. However, since insufficient production capacity exists in California to supply the state’s total fuel ethanol consumption (in excess of 1.5 billion gallons annually), we compete with ethanol transported into California from Midwestern producers. Similarly, our co-products are, principally WDG and DCO, sold into local California markets and compete with DDG and corn oil imported into the California markets as well as with alternative feed products.
 India
 
  With respect to biodiesel sold as fuel, we compete primarily with the producers of petroleum diesel, consisting of the three state-controlled oil companies: Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, and two private oil companies: Reliance Petroleum and Essar Oil, all of whom have significantly larger market shares than we do and control a significant share of the distribution network. These competitors also purchase our product for blending and further sales to their customers. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and reliable delivery, since our plant can produce distilled biodiesel and we have historically been a more reliable and high-quality supplier than some other biodiesel producers in India.
 
  With respect to biodiesel sold directly to fleets and other customers, we supply logistics companies that operate fleets of trucks, ocean port facilities with extensive trucking activities, beverage distributors, cement ready-mix suppliers and other companies that use diesel for transportation. With respect to crude and refined glycerin, we compete with other glycerin producers and refiners selling products into the personal care, paints and adhesive markets primarily on the basis of price and product quality.
 
  Customers
 
  North America
 
  All of our ethanol and WDG are sold to J.D. Heiskell pursuant to the Heiskell Purchase Agreement. J.D. Heiskell in turn sells all of our ethanol to Kinergy and all of our WDG to A.L. Gilbert. Kinergy markets and sells our ethanol to petroleum refiners and blenders in Northern California. A.L. Gilbert markets and sells our WDG to approximately 100 dairy and feeding operators in Northern California.
 India
 
  During 2018, we derived 79% and 21% of our sales from biodiesel and refined glycerin respectively. Two of our biodiesel customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues at 53% and 13%. None of our refined glycerin customers have accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues in 2018. During 2017, we derived 77% and 23% of our sales from biodiesel and refined glycerin respectively. Two of our biodiesel customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues at 47% and 13%. None of our refined glycerin customers have accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues in 2017.
 Pricing
 
  North America
 
 We sell 100% of the ethanol and WDG we produce to J.D. Heiskell. Ethanol pricing is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement between Kinergy and us and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area in California, as published by OPIS, as well as the terms of quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with local fuel blenders and available premiums for fuel with low carbon intensity as provided by California’s LCFS. The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement between A.L. Gilbert and us and is generally determined in reference to the price of DDG and other protein feedstuffs, based on local pricing in California’s Central Valley.

  India
 
  In India, the price of biodiesel is based on the price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets. India changed to daily dynamic pricing model where diesel prices are changed on daily basis by the Oil Marketing Companies. Biodiesel sold into Europe is based on the spot market price but recent government ban on exports, for the time being, closed this market for the Company. We sell our biodiesel primarily to Government Oil Marketing Companies, transport companies, resellers, distributors and private refiners on an as-needed basis. We have no long-term sales contracts. Our biodiesel pricing is related to the price of petroleum diesel, and the increase in the price of petroleum diesel is expected to favorably impact the profitability of our India operations.
 Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
  North America
 
 We entered into a Corn Procurement and Working Capital Agreement with J.D. Heiskell in March 2011, which we amended in May 2013 (the “Heiskell Agreement”). Under the Heiskell Agreement, we agreed to procure number two yellow dent corn from J.D. Heiskell. We have the ability to obtain corn from other sources subject to certain conditions. However, in 2017 and 2018, all of our corn supply was purchased from J.D. Heiskell. Title to the corn and risk of loss pass to us when the corn is deposited into our weigh scale. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2019.
 India
 
  In 2018, a significant amount of our biodiesel was derived from processing crude palm stearin, which was imported from Indonesia, and the remaining portion was derived from refining feedstocks based on animal fats. During 2018 and 2017, we imported crude glycerin for further processing into refined glycerin. In addition to feedstock, the Kakinada Plant requires quantities of methanol and chemical catalysts for use in the biodiesel production process. These chemicals are also readily available and sourced from a number of suppliers surrounding the Kakinada Plant. We are not dependent on sole source or limited source suppliers for any of our raw materials or chemicals.
 Sales and Marketing
 
  North America
 
  As part of our obligations under the Heiskell Agreement, we entered into a purchase agreement with J.D. Heiskell, pursuant to which we granted J.D. Heiskell exclusive rights to purchase 100% of the ethanol and WDG we produce at prices based upon the price established by the marketing agreements with Kinergy and A.L. Gilbert. In turn, J.D. Heiskell agreed to resell all the ethanol to Kinergy (or any other purchaser we designate) and all of the WDG to A.L. Gilbert.
 
  In March 2011, we entered into a WDG Purchase and Sale Agreement with A.L. Gilbert, pursuant to which A.L. Gilbert agreed to market, on an exclusive basis, all of the WDG we produce. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2019.
 
 In October 2010, we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Kinergy to market and sell our ethanol. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on August 31, 2019.
 
 We sell our DCO and CDS directly to local third-party animal feedlots.
 
  India
 
  We sell our biodiesel and refined glycerin to (i) end-users utilizing our own sales force and independent sales agents, (ii) brokers who resell the product to end-users and (iii) Government Oil Marketing Companies. We pay a sales commission on sales arranged by independent sales agents.

  Commodity Risk Management Practices
 
  North America
 
  The cost of corn and the price of ethanol are volatile and the correlation of the pricing of these commodities form the basis for the profit margin at our Keyes Plant. We are, therefore, exposed to commodity price risk. Our risk management strategy is to operate in the physical market by purchasing corn and selling ethanol on a daily basis at the then prevailing market price. We monitor these prices daily to test for an overall positive variable contribution margin. We periodically explore and utilize methods of mitigating the volatility of our commodity prices. During 2017 and 2018, we offered three-month WDG contracts to our customers, which we offset with the purchase of corn basis, allowing us to fix a portion of the margin at the Keyes Plant. We continued with three-month WDG contracts to our customers in 2019.
 India
 
  The cost of crude palm stearin and the price of biodiesel are volatile and are generally uncorrelated. We therefore are exposed to ongoing and substantial commodity price risk. Our risk management strategy is to produce biodiesel in India only when we believe we can generate positive gross margins and to idle the Kakinada Plant during periods of low or negative gross margins. Additionally, we are pursuing relationships with large oil companies and trading partners pursuant to which we would process feedstocks and produce biofuels for sales into international markets on a fixed margin basis.
 
  In addition, to minimize our commodity risk, we modified the processes within our facility to utilize lower cost crude palm stearin and Palm based products with high FFA content, which enables us to reduce our feedstock costs. The price of our biodiesel is generally indexed to the local price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets.
 
  We have in the past, and we may in the future, use forward purchase contracts and other hedging strategies. However, the extent to which we engage in these risk management strategies may vary substantially from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors.
 
  Research and Development
 
  Our R&D efforts consist of developing, evaluating, and commercializing technologies and expanding the production of cellulosic ethanol and other renewable bio-chemicals in the United States and India. The objective of this development activity is to bring efficient conversion technologies using waste feedstocks to produce biofuels and biochemicals on a large-scale, commercial basis. Some of our innovations are protected by issued or pending patents. We are developing additional technology and expect to file additional patents that will further strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. We expect to continue to file and protect patents related to our business and future plans.
 
  We built an Integrated Demonstration Unit for our cellulosic ethanol project in 2017, which was successfully built and tested to produce renewable cellulosic ethanol by combining the LanzaTech and InEnTec Technologies with our own technology. The expense of building this unit was charged to R&D expense in 2017. In 2018, in cooperation with a federally funded agency, we secured a grant from the California Energy Commission to optimize and demonstrate the effectiveness of ionic liquids technologies for breaking down biomass to produce cellulosic ethanol. After completion of technology development and pilot testing, this technology may be applied to upgrade the Keyes Plant to add waste wood as a feedstock, thereby lowering feedstock costs and increasing the value of the ethanol produced by the plant.
 
  R&D expense was $0.2 million and $2.4 million respectively, in the years ended 2018 and 2017.
 
  Patents and Trademarks
 
 We filed a number of trademark applications within the U.S.  We do not consider the success of our business, as a whole, to be dependent on these trademarks.  In addition, we hold nine awarded patents in the United States.  Our patents cover processes to break down plant biomass and a technology to convert carbon chain chemical structures.  We intend to develop, maintain and secure further intellectual property rights and pursue new patents to expand upon our current patent base. In December 2018, the Company wrote off $0.9 million of patents associated with the Z-microbeTM and enzymatic processes to facilitate the degradation of certain plant biomass as the Company no longer plans to commercially develop the technologies itself and to free up resources to pursue other methods.

 We have acquired exclusive rights to patented technology in support of the development and commercialization of our products, and we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technology in developing potential products.  We continue to place significant emphasis on securing global intellectual property rights and we are pursuing new patents to expand upon our strong foundation for commercializing products in development.
 
  We have received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”. Infringement or other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, which could harm our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause delays in the development of our products, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may require us to license back our technology or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
  Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
  North America
 
 In December 2018, the EPA finalized the volume requirements and associated percentage standards that apply under the RFS program in calendar year 2019 for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel.
 
 The final volumes requirements are set forth below and represent continued growth over historic levels. The final percentage standards meet or exceed the volume targets specified by Congress for total renewable fuel, biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel.
 
 
Renewable Fuel Volume Requirements for 2015-2019
------------------------------------------------
Year | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 
Cellulosic biofuel (million gallons) | 123 | 230 | 311 | 288 | 418 
Biomass-based diesel (billion gallons) | 1.73 | 1.9 | 2.0 | 2.1 | 2.1 
Advanced biofuel (billion gallons) | 2.88 | 3.61 | 4.28 | 4.29 | 4.92

  We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws, regulations and permits may, from time to time, require us to incur significant capital costs. These include, but are not limited to, testing and monitoring plant emissions, and where necessary, obtaining and maintaining mitigation processes to comply with regulations. They may also require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A significant violation of these laws, regulations, permits or license conditions could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.

  We are also subject to potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous wastes. If significant contamination is identified at our properties in the future, costs to investigate and remediate this contamination as well as costs to investigate or remediate associated damage could be significant. If any of these sites are subject to investigation and/or remediation requirements, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of such investigation and/or remediation, and for damage to natural resources. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from such properties. While costs to address contamination or related third-party claims could be significant, based upon currently available information, we are not aware of any such material contamination or third-party claims. Based on our current assessment of the environmental and regulatory risks, we have not accrued any amounts for environmental matters as of December 31, 2018. The ultimate costs of any liabilities that may be identified or the discovery of additional contaminants could materially adversely impact our results of operation or financial condition.
 
  In addition, the production and transportation of our products may result in spills or releases of hazardous substances, which could result in claims from governmental authorities or third parties relating to actual or alleged personal injury, property damage, or damage to natural resources. We maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses caused by our operations. Our general and umbrella liability policy coverage includes, but is not limited to, physical damage to assets, employer’s liability, comprehensive general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation. We do not carry environmental insurance. We believe that our insurance is adequate for our industry, but losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of events which result in significant personal injury or damage to our property, natural resources or third parties that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
  Our air emissions are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, and similar state laws, which generally require us to obtain and maintain air emission permits for our ongoing operations as well as for any expansion of existing facilities or any new facilities. Obtaining and maintaining those permits requires us to incur costs, and any future more stringent standards may result in increased costs and may limit or interfere with our operating flexibility. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because other ethanol manufacturers in the U.S. are and will continue to be subject to similar laws and restrictions, we do not currently believe that our costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations will adversely affect our competitive position with other U.S. ethanol producers. However, because ethanol is produced and traded internationally, these costs could adversely affect us in our efforts to compete with foreign producers who are not subject to such stringent requirements.
 
  New laws or regulations relating to the production, disposal or emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may require us to incur significant additional costs with respect to ethanol plants that we build or acquire. We currently conduct our North American commercial activities exclusively in California. Climate change and greenhouse gas emission (“GHG”) reduction legislation is a topic of consideration by the U.S. Congress and California State Legislature, which may significantly impact the biofuels industry’s emissions regulations, as will the RFS, California’s LCFS, and other potentially significant changes in existing transportation fuels regulations.
 
  India
 
  We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits, including with respect to the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws may require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.
 Employees
 
  At December 31, 2018, we had a total of 153 employees, comprised of 13 full-time employees and one part-time equivalent employee in our corporate offices, 40 full-time equivalent employees at the Keyes Plant, and 99 full-time equivalent employees in India.
 
 We believe that our employees are highly skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain our employees and attract new qualified employees, many of whom are in great demand. We have never had a work stoppage or strike, and no employees are presently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are positive.
