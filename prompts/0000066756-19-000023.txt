Six taconite facilities served by Minnesota Power made up approximately 80 percent of 2017 iron ore pellet production in the U.S. according to data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue 2018 Mining Tax Guide. Sales to taconite customers and iron concentrate customers represented 5,039 million kWh, or 69 percent of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2018. Taconite, an iron‑bearing rock of relatively low iron content, is abundantly available in northern Minnesota and an important domestic source of raw material for the steel industry. Taconite processing plants use large quantities of electric power to grind the iron-bearing rock, and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite pellets. Iron concentrate reclamation facilities also use large quantities of electricity to extract and process iron-bearing tailings left from previous mining operations in the production of iron ore concentrate.
Minnesota Power’s taconite customers are capable of producing approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, pipe and tube products for the gas and oil industry, and in the construction industry. Historically, less than 10 percent of Minnesota taconite production has been exported outside of North America. Minnesota Power also has provided electric service to three iron concentrate facilities capable of producing up to approximately 4 million tons of iron concentrate per year. Iron concentrate is used in the production of taconite pellets. These facilities have been idled since at least 2016. On July 17, 2018, ERP Iron Ore announced it would no longer seek to restart its iron concentrate operations. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Outlook – Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load.)
There has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute, an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 78 percent of capacity in 2018 (74 percent in 2017 and 71 percent in 2016). The World Steel Association, an association of over 160 steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes representing approximately 85 percent of world steel production, projected U.S. steel consumption in 2019 will increase by approximately one percent compared to 2018.

* Preliminary data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue. 

Minnesota Power’s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power’s taconite customers’ production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Minnesota Power proactively sells power in the wholesale power markets that is temporarily not required by industrial customers to optimize the value of its generating facilities. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a general rate case to recover lost revenue.
In addition to serving the taconite industry, Minnesota Power serves a number of customers in the paper, pulp and secondary wood products industry, which represented 987 million kWh, or 14 percent of total industrial customer kWh sales in 2018. Minnesota Power also has agreements to provide steam for two of its paper and pulp customers for use in the customers’ operations. The four major paper and pulp mills we serve reported operating at lower levels in 2018 compared to 2017 resulting from the closure of the smaller of UPM Blandin’s two paper machines in the fourth quarter of 2017. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load.) 
Large Power Customer Contracts. Minnesota Power has eight Large Power Customer contracts, each serving requirements of 10 MW or more of customer load. The customers consist of six taconite facilities and four paper and pulp mills. Certain facilities have common ownership and are served under combined contracts.
Large Power Customer contracts require Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available. In turn, each Large Power Customer is required to pay a minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs associated with having this capacity available to serve the customer, including a return on common equity. Most contracts allow customers to establish the level of megawatts subject to a demand charge on a four-month basis and require that a portion of their megawatt needs be committed on a take-or-pay basis for at least a portion of the term of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge, each Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each kWh used that recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity. Five of the Large Power Customer contracts have interruptible service which provides a discounted demand rate in exchange for the ability to interrupt the customers during system emergencies. Minnesota Power also provides incremental production service for customer demand levels above the contractual take-or-pay levels. There is no demand charge for this service and energy is priced at an increment above Minnesota Power’s cost. Incremental production service is interruptible.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Large Power Customer Contracts (Continued)
All contracts with Large Power Customers continue past the contract termination date unless the required advance notice of cancellation has been given. The required advance notice of cancellation varies from two to four years. Such contracts minimize the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from significant reductions in kWh sales to such customers. Large Power Customers are required to take all of their purchased electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Regulatory Matters – Electric Rates.)
Minnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly energy usage estimates. These customers receive estimated bills based on Minnesota Power’s estimate of the customer’s energy usage, forecasted energy prices and fuel adjustment clause estimates. Minnesota Power’s taconite‑producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable energy usage on a week-to-week basis and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Other Power Suppliers. The Company also enters into off-system sales with Other Power Suppliers. These sales are at market‑based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations.
Our PSAs are detailed in Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraphs.
Basin PSAs. Minnesota Power has an agreement to sell 100 MW of capacity and energy to Basin for a ten-year period which expires in April 2020. The capacity charge is based on a fixed monthly schedule with a minimum annual escalation provision. The energy charge is based on a fixed monthly schedule and provides for annual escalation based on the cost of fuel. The agreement also allows Minnesota Power to recover a pro rata share of increased costs related to emissions that occur during the last five years of the contract. Minnesota Power has three additional agreements to sell capacity to Basin at fixed prices. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Commitments.)
Minnkota Power PSA. Minnesota Power has a PSA with Minnkota Power where Minnesota Power is selling a portion of its entitlement from Square Butte to Minnkota Power, resulting in Minnkota Power’s net entitlement increasing and Minnesota Power’s net entitlement decreasing until Minnesota Power’s share is eliminated at the end of 2025. Of Minnesota Power’s 50 percent output entitlement, it sold approximately 28 percent to Minnkota Power in 2018 (28 percent in 2017 and in 2016). (See Power Supply – Long-Term Purchased Power.) 
Silver Bay Power PSA. In 2016, Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power entered into a PSA through 2031. Silver Bay Power supplies approximately 90 MW of load to Northshore Mining, an affiliate of Silver Bay Power, which has been served predominately through self-generation by Silver Bay Power. Through 2019, Minnesota Power will supply Silver Bay Power with at least 50 MW of energy and Silver Bay Power has the option to purchase additional energy from Minnesota Power as it transitions away from self-generation. By December 31, 2019, Silver Bay Power is expected to cease self-generation and Minnesota Power is expected to supply the energy requirements for Silver Bay Power.
Seasonality
The operations of our industrial customers, which make up a large portion of our electric sales, are not typically subject to significant seasonal variations. (See Electric Sales / Customers.) As a result, Minnesota Power is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in electric sales; however, Minnesota Power and SWL&P electric and natural gas sales to other customers may be affected by seasonal differences in weather. In general, peak electric sales occur in the winter and summer months with fewer electric sales in the spring and fall months. Peak sales of natural gas generally occur in the winter months. Additionally, our regulated utilities have historically generated fewer sales and less revenue when weather conditions are milder in the winter and summer.
Power Supply
In order to meet its customers’ electric requirements, Minnesota Power utilizes a mix of its own generation and purchased power. As of December 31, 2018, Minnesota Power’s generating capability is primarily coal-fired, but also includes wind energy, hydroelectric, natural gas-fired, biomass co-fired and solar generation. Purchased power primarily consists of long-term coal, wind and hydro PPAs as well as market purchases. The following table reflects Minnesota Power’s generating capabilities as of December 31, 2018, and total electrical supply for 2018. Minnesota Power had an annual net peak load of 1,589 MW on August 13, 2018.

Power Supply (Continued)
Fuel. Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin region located in Montana and Wyoming. Coal consumption in 2018 for electric generation at Minnesota Power’s coal-fired generating stations was 3.8 million tons (3.8 million tons in 2017; 4.2 million tons in 2016). As of December 31, 2018, Minnesota Power had coal inventories of 0.9 million tons (1.2 million tons as of December 31, 2017). Minnesota Power has coal supply agreements providing for the purchase of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2019 and a portion of its coal requirements through December 2021. In 2019, Minnesota Power expects to obtain coal under these coal supply agreements and in the spot market. Minnesota Power continues to explore other future coal supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub‑bituminous coal will continue to be available.
Minnesota Power also has coal transportation agreements in place for the delivery of a significant portion of its coal requirements through December 2021. The costs of fuel and related transportation costs for Minnesota Power’s generation are recoverable from Minnesota Power’s utility customers through the fuel adjustment clause.

Long-Term Purchased Power. Minnesota Power has contracts to purchase capacity and energy from various entities, including output from certain coal, wind, hydro and solar generating facilities. 
Our PPAs are detailed in Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, with additional disclosure provided in the following paragraph.
Square Butte PPA. Under the PPA with Square Butte that extends through 2026, Minnesota Power is entitled to 50 percent of the output of Square Butte’s 455 MW coal-fired generating unit. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) BNI Energy mines and sells lignite coal to Square Butte. This lignite supply is sufficient to provide fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating unit. Square Butte’s cost of lignite consumed in 2018 was approximately $1.60 per MBtu ($1.71 per MBtu in 2017; $1.57 per MBtu in 2016). (See Electric Sales / Customers – Minnkota Power PSA.)
Transmission and Distribution
We have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (8 miles), 345 kV (242 miles), 250 kV (465 miles), 230 kV (717 miles), 161 kV (43 miles), 138 kV (190 miles), 115 kV (1,285 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,342 miles). We own and operate 159 substations with a total capacity of 8,531 megavoltamperes. Some of our transmission and distribution lines interconnect with other utilities.
Great Northern Transmission Line. As a condition of a 250 MW long-term PPA entered into with Manitoba Hydro, construction of additional transmission capacity is required. As a result, Minnesota Power is constructing the GNTL, an approximately 220‑mile 500-kV transmission line between Manitoba and Minnesota’s Iron Range that was proposed by Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro in order to strengthen the electric grid, enhance regional reliability and promote a greater exchange of sustainable energy.
In a 2016 order, the MPUC approved the route permit for the GNTL, and in 2016, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a presidential permit to cross the U.S.‑Canadian border, which was the final major regulatory approval needed before construction in the U.S. could begin. Site clearing and pre‑construction activities commenced in the first quarter of 2017 with construction expected to be completed in 2020. To date, most of the right-of-way has been cleared while foundation installation and transmission tower construction have commenced. The total project cost in the U.S., including substation work, is estimated to be between $560 million and $710 million, of which Minnesota Power’s portion is expected to be between $300 million and $350 million; the difference will be recovered from a subsidiary of Manitoba Hydro as non-shareholder contributions to capital. Total project costs of $380.8 million have been incurred through December 31, 2018, of which $203.7 million has been recovered from a subsidiary of Manitoba Hydro. 
Manitoba Hydro must obtain regulatory and governmental approvals related to the MMTP, a new transmission line in Canada that will connect with the GNTL. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)

Investment in ATC
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE Transmission Holdings, owns approximately 8 percent of ATC, a Wisconsin-based utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. We account for our investment in ATC under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2018, our equity investment in ATC was $128.1 million ($118.7 million as of December 31, 2017). (See Note 5. Equity Investments.) 
ATC’s authorized return on equity is 10.32 percent, or 10.82 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization. In 2016, a federal administrative law judge ruled on a complaint proposing a reduction in the base return on equity to 9.70 percent, or 10.20 percent including an incentive adder for participation in a regional transmission organization, subject to approval or adjustment by the FERC. A final decision from the FERC on the administrative law judge’s recommendation is pending. 
ATC’s 10-year transmission assessment, which covers the years 2018 through 2027, identifies a need for between $2.8 billion and $3.4 billion in transmission system investments. These investments by ATC, if undertaken, are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated cash, debt and investor contributions. As opportunities arise, we plan to make additional investments in ATC through general capital calls based upon our pro rata ownership interest in ATC.
Properties
Our Regulated Operations businesses own office and service buildings, an energy control center, repair shops, electric plants, transmission facilities and storerooms in various localities in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. All of the electric plants are subject to mortgages, which collateralize the outstanding first mortgage bonds of Minnesota Power and SWL&P. Most of the generating plants and substations are located on real property owned by Minnesota Power or SWL&P, subject to the lien of a mortgage, whereas most of the electric lines are located on real property owned by others with appropriate easement rights or necessary permits from governmental authorities. WPPI Energy owns 20 percent of Boswell Unit 4. WPPI Energy has the right to use our transmission line facilities to transport its share of Boswell generation. (See Note 3. Jointly-Owned Facilities and Projects.)
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory authorities and other organizations. 
Electric Rates. All rates and contract terms in our Regulated Operations are subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities. Minnesota Power and SWL&P design their retail electric service rates based on cost of service studies under which allocations are made to the various classes of customers as approved by the MPUC or the PSCW. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses, which may adjust electric service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy, recovery of current and deferred conservation improvement program expenditures and recovery of certain transmission, renewable and environmental investments.
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The MPUC has regulatory authority over Minnesota Power’s retail service area in Minnesota, retail rates, retail services, capital structure, issuance of securities and other matters. As authorized by the MPUC, Minnesota Power also recognizes revenue under cost recovery riders for transmission, renewable and environmental investments.

2016 Minnesota General Rate Case. In November 2016, Minnesota Power filed a retail rate increase request with the MPUC which sought an average increase of approximately 9 percent for retail customers. The rate filing sought a return on equity of 10.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. The MPUC issued an order dated March 12, 2018, in Minnesota Power’s general rate case approving a return on common equity of 9.25 percent and a 53.81 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect on December 1, 2018, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $13 million on an annualized basis. Interim rates were collected from January 1, 2017, through November 30, 2018, which were fully offset by the recognition of a corresponding reserve. Minnesota Power has recorded a reserve for an interim rate refund, net of discounts provided to EITE customers, of $40.0 million as of December 31, 2018 ($23.7 million as of December 31, 2017) which is expected to be refunded in 2019. The MPUC also disallowed Minnesota Power’s regulatory asset for deferred fuel adjustment clause costs due to the anticipated adoption of a forward-looking fuel adjustment clause methodology resulting in a $19.5 million pre-tax charge to Fuel, Purchased Power and Gas – Utility in 2017. As part of its decision in Minnesota Power’s 2016 general rate case, the MPUC also extended the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2050 primarily to mitigate rate increases for our customers, and shortened the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 1 and Unit 2 to 2022, resulting in a net decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $25 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
On April 2, 2018, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC requesting reconsideration of certain decisions in the MPUC’s order dated March 12, 2018. In an order dated May 29, 2018, the MPUC denied Minnesota Power’s petition for reconsideration and accepted a Minnesota Department of Commerce request for reconsideration reducing the depreciable lives of Boswell Unit 3, Unit 4 and common facilities to 2035 while utilizing the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate enacted as part of the TCJA to mitigate the impact on customer rates.
Energy-Intensive Trade-Exposed Customer Rates. An EITE customer ratemaking law was enacted in 2015 establishing a Minnesota energy policy to have competitive rates for certain industries such as mining and forest products. The MPUC approved a reduction in rates for EITE customers in a December 2016 order and subsequently approved cost recovery in an April 2017 order. Minnesota Power expects the discount to EITE customers to be approximately $16 million annually based on EITE customer current operating levels. While interim rates were in effect for Minnesota Power’s 2016 general rate case, discounts provided to EITE customers offset interim rate refund reserves for non-EITE customers. Minnesota Power provided $16.7 million of discounts to EITE customers during the year ended December 31, 2018 ($8.6 million and none for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively)
Additional regulatory proceedings pending with the MPUC are detailed in Note 4. Regulatory Matters.
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. The PSCW has regulatory authority over SWL&P’s retail sales of electricity, natural gas and water, issuances of securities and other matters. 
2016 Wisconsin General Rate Case. SWL&P’s retail rates in 2018 were based on a 2017 PSCW retail rate order effective August 2017 that allowed for a 10.5 percent return on common equity and a 55 percent equity ratio. SWL&P’s retail rates prior to August 2017 were based on a 2012 PSCW retail rate order that provided for a 10.9 percent return on equity. 
2018 Wisconsin General Rate Case. On May 25, 2018, SWL&P filed a rate increase request with the PSCW requesting an average increase of 2.7 percent for retail customers (2.0 percent increase in electric rates; 2.3 percent increase in natural gas rates; and 0.1 percent increase in water rates). The filing sought an overall return on equity of 10.5 percent and a 55.41 percent equity ratio. In an order dated December 20, 2018, the PSCW approved a rate increase for SWL&P including a return on equity of 10.4 percent and a 55.0 percent equity ratio. Final rates went into effect January 1, 2019, which is expected to result in additional revenue of approximately $1.3 million on an annualized basis. 
North Dakota Public Service Commission. The NDPSC has jurisdiction over site and route permitting of generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the establishment of rates and charges for transmission of electricity in interstate commerce, electricity sold at wholesale (including the rates for Minnesota Power’s municipal and wholesale customers), natural gas transportation, certain accounting and record‑keeping practices, certain activities of our regulated utilities and the operations of ATC. FERC jurisdiction also includes enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards. Violations of FERC rules are subject to enforcement action by the FERC including financial penalties up to $1 million per day per violation. Regulatory proceedings pending with the FERC are detailed in Note 4. Regulatory Matters.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Regional Organizations
Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. Minnesota Power, SWL&P and ATC are members of MISO, a regional transmission organization. While Minnesota Power and SWL&P retain ownership of their respective transmission assets, their transmission networks are under the regional operational control of MISO. Minnesota Power and SWL&P take and provide transmission service under the MISO open access transmission tariff. In cooperation with stakeholders, MISO manages the delivery of electric power across all or parts of 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba which includes nearly 200,000 MW of generating capacity.
North American Electric Reliability Corporation. The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC ensures the reliability of the North American bulk power system. The NERC oversees seven regional entities that establish requirements, approved by the FERC, for reliable operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and transmission systems. Minnesota Power is subject to these reliability requirements and can incur significant penalties for non‑compliance.
Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO). Minnesota Power and ATC are members of the MRO, one of the seven regional entities overseen by the NERC. The MRO's primary responsibilities are to: ensure compliance with mandatory reliability standards by entities who own, operate or use the interconnected, international bulk power system; conduct assessments of the grid's ability to meet electricity demand in the region; and analyze regional system events.
The MRO region spans the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and all or parts of 16 states. The region includes more than 200 organizations that are involved in the production and delivery of electricity. These organizations include municipal utilities, cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, transmission system operators, a federal power marketing agency, Canadian Crown corporations and independent power producers.
Minnesota Legislation
Renewable Energy. Minnesota law requires 25 percent of electric utilities’ applicable retail and municipal energy sales in Minnesota to be from renewable energy sources by 2025. Minnesota law also requires Minnesota Power to meet interim milestones of 12 percent by 2012, 17 percent by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020. The law allows the MPUC to modify or delay meeting a milestone if implementation will cause significant ratepayer cost or technical reliability issues. If a utility is not in compliance with a milestone, the MPUC may order the utility to construct facilities, purchase renewable energy or purchase renewable energy credits. Minnesota Power’s 2015 IRP, which was filed with the MPUC in 2015 and approved with modifications by the MPUC in a 2016 order, includes an update on its plans and progress in meeting the Minnesota renewable energy milestones through 2025. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – EnergyForward.) 
Minnesota Power continues to execute its renewable energy strategy through renewable projects that will ensure it meets the identified state mandate at the lowest cost for customers. Minnesota Power has exceeded the interim milestone requirements to date with 26 percent of its applicable retail and municipal energy sales supplied by renewable energy sources in 2018.
Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. Minnesota law requires at least 1.5 percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain customers, to be generated by solar energy by the end of 2020. At least 10 percent of the 1.5 percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 40 kW or less and community solar garden subscriptions. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – EnergyForward.)
Competition
Retail electric energy sales in Minnesota and Wisconsin are made to customers in assigned service territories. As a result, most retail electric customers in Minnesota do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. Large energy users of 2 MW and above that are located outside of a municipality are allowed to choose a supplier upon MPUC approval. Minnesota Power serves 10 Large Power facilities over 10 MW, none of which have engaged in a competitive rate process. No other large commercial or small industrial customers in Minnesota Power’s service territory have sought a provider outside Minnesota Power’s service territory. Retail electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin do not have the ability to choose their energy supplier. In both states, however, electricity may compete with other forms of energy. Customers may also choose to generate their own electricity, or substitute other forms of energy for their manufacturing processes.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued)
Competition (Continued)
In 2018, five percent of total regulated utility kWh sales were to municipal customers in Minnesota by contract. These customers have the right to seek an energy supply from any wholesale electric service provider upon contract expiration. Minnesota Power’s wholesale electric contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission is effective through at least December 31, 2032. Minnesota Power wholesale electric contracts with 14 municipal customers are effective through varying dates ranging from 2024 through 2029. In 2016, one of Minnesota Power’s municipal customers provided a contract termination notice effective June 30, 2019. (See Electric Sales / Customers.)
The FERC has continued with its efforts to promote a competitive wholesale market through open-access electric transmission and other means. As a result, our electric sales to Other Power Suppliers and our purchases to supply our retail and wholesale load are made in a competitive market.
Franchises
Minnesota Power holds franchises to construct and maintain an electric distribution and transmission system in 91 cities. The remaining cities, villages and towns served by Minnesota Power do not require a franchise to operate. SWL&P serves customers under electric, natural gas or water franchises in 1 city and 14 villages or towns.
ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATED SERVICES
ALLETE Clean Energy
ALLETE Clean Energy focuses on developing, acquiring, and operating clean and renewable energy projects. ALLETE Clean Energy currently owns and operates, in four states, approximately 545 MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation that is contracted under PSAs of various durations. ALLETE Clean Energy also engages in the development of wind energy facilities to operate under long-term PSAs or for sale to others upon completion.
ALLETE Clean Energy believes the market for renewable energy in North America is robust, driven by several factors including environmental regulation, tax incentives, societal expectations and continual technology advances. State renewable portfolio standards, and state or federal regulations to limit GHG emissions are examples of environmental regulation or public policy that we believe will drive renewable energy development.
ALLETE Clean Energy’s strategy includes the safe, reliable, optimal and profitable operation of its existing facilities. This includes a strong safety culture, the continuous pursuit of operational efficiencies at existing facilities and cost controls. ALLETE Clean Energy generally acquires facilities in liquid power markets and its strategy includes the exploration of PSA extensions upon expiration of existing contracts and production tax credit requalification of existing facilities.

ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATED SERVICES (Continued)
ALLETE Clean Energy (Continued)
ALLETE Clean Energy manages risk by having a diverse portfolio of assets, which includes PSA expiration, technology and geographic diversity. The current portfolio of approximately 545 MW is subject to typical variations in seasonal wind with higher wind resources typically available in the winter months. The majority of its planned maintenance leverages this seasonality and is performed during lower wind periods. The current mix of PSA expiration and geographic location for existing facilities is as follows:

Wind Energy Facility | Location | Capacity MW | PSA MW | PSA Expiration
Armenia Mountain | Pennsylvania | 100.5 | 100% | 2024 
Chanarambie/Viking | Minnesota | 97.5 | | 
PSA 1 (a) | | | 12% | 2023 
PSA 2 | | | 88% | 2023

PSA 2 | | | 10% | 2032 


(a) | The PSA expiration assumes the exercise of four one-year renewal options that ALLETE Clean Energy has the sole right to exercise.

The majority of ALLETE Clean Energy’s wind operations are located on real property owned by others with appropriate easement rights or necessary consents of governmental authorities. Two of ALLETE Clean Energy’s wind energy facilities are encumbered by liens against their assets securing financing. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – Energy Infrastructure and Related Services – ALLETE Clean Energy.)
U.S. Water Services
On February 8, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement providing for the sale of U.S. Water Services to a subsidiary of Kurita Water Industries Ltd. for a cash purchase price of $270 million, subject to adjustment at closing, such as for changes in working capital. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2019 upon receipt of regulatory approval. ALLETE plans to use the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Water Services primarily to reinvest in growth initiatives at our Regulated Operations and ALLETE Clean Energy. ALLETE will also consider using a portion of the proceeds to implement a common stock repurchase program. 
U.S. Water Services provides integrated water management for industry by combining chemical, equipment, engineering and service for customized solutions to reduce water and energy usage, and improve efficiency. U.S. Water Services has a presence in 49 states and Canada and has an established base of approximately 4,900 customers. U.S. Water Services differentiates itself from the competition by developing synergies between solutions in engineering, equipment and chemical water treatment, which helps customers achieve efficient and sustainable use of their water and energy systems. U.S. Water Services is a leading provider to the biofuels industry, and also serves the commercial and institutional markets, food and beverage, light manufacturing, power generation, and midstream oil and gas industries, among others. U.S. Water Services principally relies upon recurring revenues from a diverse mix of industrial customers. U.S. Water Services sells certain products which are seasonal in nature, with higher demand typically realized in warmer months; generally, lower sales occur in the first quarter of each year. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Outlook – Energy Infrastructure and Related Services – U.S. Water Services.)
In September 2017, U.S. Water Services acquired Tonka Water for total consideration of $19.2 million. Tonka Water is a supplier of municipal and industrial water treatment systems that expanded U.S. Water Services’ geographic and customer markets.

CORPORATE AND OTHER
BNI Energy
BNI Energy is a supplier of lignite coal in North Dakota, producing approximately 4 million tons annually and has an estimated 650 million tons of lignite coal reserves. Two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, consume virtually all of BNI Energy’s production of lignite under cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements extending through December 31, 2037. (See Item 1. Business – Regulated Operations – Power Supply – Long-Term Purchased Power and Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims between 200 and 250 acres per year. Laws require that the reclaimed land be at least as productive as it was prior to mining. As of December 31, 2018, BNI Energy had a $26.5 million asset reclamation obligation ($25.0 million as of December 31, 2017) included in Other Non-Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs are included in the cost-plus fixed fee contract, for which an asset reclamation cost receivable was included in Other Non-Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The asset reclamation obligation is guaranteed by surety bonds and a letter of credit. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)
Investment in Nobles 2
On December 27, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE South Wind, entered into a partnership agreement with Tenaska to purchase a 49 percent equity interest in Nobles 2, the entity that will own and operate a 250 MW wind energy facility in southwestern Minnesota pursuant to a 20-year PPA with Minnesota Power. The wind energy facility will be built in Nobles County, Minnesota and is expected to be completed in late 2020, with an estimated total project cost of approximately $350 million to $400 million of which our portion is expected to be approximately $170 million to $200 million. We expect to utilize tax equity to finance a portion of our project costs, with an ALLETE expected equity investment of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We account for our investment in Nobles 2 under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2018, our equity investment in Nobles 2 was $33.0 million. (See Note 5. Equity Investments.)

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. A number of regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements have been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities over the past several years. Minnesota Power’s facilities are subject to additional requirements under many of these regulations. Minnesota Power is reshaping its generation portfolio, over time, to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and policy during rulemaking implementation.
We consider our businesses to be in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and believe all necessary permits have been obtained. We anticipate that with many state and federal environmental regulations and requirements finalized, or to be finalized in the near future, potential expenditures for future environmental matters may be material and require significant capital investments. Minnesota Power has evaluated various environmental compliance scenarios using possible outcomes of environmental regulations to project power supply trends and impacts on customers.
We review environmental matters on a quarterly basis. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are adjusted as assessment and remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are expensed unless recoverable in rates from customers. (See Note 11. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, ALLETE had 1,889 employees, of which 1,852 were full-time.
Minnesota Power and SWL&P have an aggregate of 475 employees who are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 31. The current labor agreements with IBEW Local 31 expire on April 30, 2020, for Minnesota Power and February 1, 2021, for SWL&P.
