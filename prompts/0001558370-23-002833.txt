Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical stage genetic medicines company focused on developing transformative therapies for central nervous system, or CNS, disorders with limited or no approved treatment options. Our vision is to fulfill the promise of gene therapy by developing groundbreaking therapies that transform the lives of patients with CNS diseases. The field of genetic medicine is rapidly expanding and we believe we have a differentiated approach to developing treatments for CNS disorders that enables us to select and advance product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success. We have entered into a strategic research collaboration with the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania’s, or Penn’s, Gene Therapy Program, or GTP, headed by Dr. James Wilson, a leader in the genetic medicines field. We also leverage our close working relationship with Penn’s Orphan Disease Center, or ODC, to develop historical and prospective comparable natural history patient profiles for comparison to participants in interventional trials. Through this collaboration we have assembled a strong portfolio of genetic medicine product candidates, for which we retain global rights, including our two lead clinical product candidates: PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis, or GM1, and PBFT02 for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia, or FTD; and two clinical stage product candidates for which, in order to reduce operating expenses, we have stopped further clinical development and are exploring strategic alternatives: PBKR03 for the treatment of Krabbe disease and PBML04 for metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD. We have two programs in the research stage: PBAL05 for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and an unnamed program for Huntington’s disease. We also have an exploratory research program for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, or TLE.
We founded Passage Bio with the intent to build a differentiated CNS genetic medicines company delivering transformative therapies to patients by combining our team’s experience in rare and neurological disease development, manufacturing and commercialization with the pioneering research expertise of GTP in gene therapy. We are purposefully focusing on rare CNS disorders for which we believe our genetic medicine approach provides distinct technical advantages based on decades of research by GTP. GTP conducts rigorous preclinical studies to identify promising product candidates. Our collaboration provides us with access to cutting edge capabilities and innovation in the field of genetic medicine research, including capsid engineering and next-generation capsid libraries, vector engineering, transgene design and gene therapy modalities, animal disease models and related studies for lead-optimization of product candidates. Further, we believe our team’s deep clinical development experience in rare and neurological diseases will enable well planned clinical trials with the potential for efficient advancement to regulatory approval. In addition, we are engaging with key opinion leaders, practitioners and patient advocacy groups in the field of rare CNS disorders who provide strategic input and help inform our clinical development activities. We believe that our ability to execute on the above tenets provides us with product candidates that have an improved profile for clinical development and an enhanced probability of success.
We are focused on developing and commercializing disease-modifying therapies that can have a transformative impact on patients’ lives. Utilizing our rigorous selection process, we have assembled a strong portfolio of product candidates for rare, monogenic CNS disorders. Our first product candidate, PBGM01, utilizes a next-generation AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional GLB1 gene encoding lysosomal beta-galactosidase, or β-gal, for GM1. Our second product candidate, PBFT02, utilizes an AAV1 capsid to deliver to the brain a functional GRN gene encoding progranulin, or PGRN, for FTD caused by progranulin deficiency, or FTD-GRN. There are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies for these diseases. We believe our clinical product candidates have the potential to provide patients with significantly improved outcomes, given our chosen route of intra cisterna magna, or ICM, administration, the potential for enhanced benefits due to cross-correction of neighboring cells by secreted gene products, and our rigorous capsid and transgene selection process.
Our research collaboration with GTP provides us with access to one of the premier research institutions in the world for the discovery and preclinical development of genetic medicine product candidates and exclusive rights to product candidates for certain CNS disorders. As part of this collaboration, we have exclusive rights to all discovery work and IND-enabling research for product candidates in the CNS indications that we select. In

addition to our two lead clinical product candidates, we have two clinical product candidates for which, in order to reduce operating expenses, we have stopped further clinical development and are exploring strategic alternatives, two ongoing research programs, and eight remaining options available to us to license additional programs from GTP until August 2026. We also have an exploratory research program with GTP in non-rare, non-monogenic, or large, CNS indications, currently focused on TLE, which can be expanded to other large, CNS diseases upon mutual agreement with GTP. Further, we have exclusive rights, subject to certain limitations, to technologies resulting from the discovery program for our products developed with GTP, such as novel capsids, toxicity reduction technologies, delivery, and formulation. We have global commercial rights to all of our current and future product candidates and believe that our approach to developing therapies for life-threatening diseases that are currently underserved presents an opportunity to efficiently advance our product candidates through clinical development, regulatory approval and ultimately to commercialization.
We are led by pioneers and experts with decades of collective experience in genetic medicines and rare disease drug development, manufacturing and commercialization. Dr. Wilson, one of our scientific founders, is recognized as a world leader in research and development in the fields of genetic medicines and rare disease. Dr. Wilson’s continuing relationship with our company helps guide our clinical and research programs. We have assembled a team whose members have extensive experience in successfully developing, manufacturing and commercializing genetic medicine and rare disease products.
Our pipeline
We have assembled a strong portfolio of genetic medicine product candidates for rare, monogenic CNS disorders characterized by high unmet medical needs. We intend to further expand our portfolio with genetic medicine product candidates for other CNS disorders, as well as other treatment approaches as technology advances in the field. Our development programs consist of:
*8 additional CNS pipeline license options remain; 3 license options were previously exercised, and rights were subsequently returned to the University of Pennsylvania.
† Program includes ongoing natural history study of infantile and juvenile GM1 gangliosidosis patients
​
PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1
We are currently developing PBGM01, which utilizes a proprietary, next-generation AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional GLB1 gene encoding β-galactosidase (or β-gal) for infantile GM1. Infantile GM1 is the most common and severe form of GM1, in which patients have mutations in the GLB1 gene that produce little or no residual β-gal enzyme activity. β-gal is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the natural degradation of GM1 ganglioside as well as other glycan substrates. Reduced β-gal activity results in the accumulation of toxic levels of GM1 ganglioside in neurons throughout the brain, causing rapidly progressive neurodegeneration, with a life expectancy of two to ten years. Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of GM1. Early onset infantile GM1 is characterized by onset in the first 6 months of life, while late onset infantile GM1 is characterized by onset between 6 and 24 months. We believe PBGM01 could provide patients with significantly improved outcomes. In 

6



preclinical studies we observed meaningful transgene expression in both the CNS and in peripheral organs affected in GM1. We are conducting clinical trials using an ICM method of administration, which involves an injection at the craniocervical junction. 
We have an active Investigational New Drug application, or IND, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and approved clinical trial authorizations, or CTAs, in multiple countries for PBGM01, and we are actively proceeding with our Imagine-1 Trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBGM01 in patients with a diagnosis of early and late infantile GM1.
​
We have completed dosing of the initial four cohorts in our Imagine-1 Trial. This includes a total of eight patients, as follows: Cohort 1 for late infantile GM1 treated with low dose PBGM01, Cohort 2 for late infantile GM1 treated with high dose PBGM01, Cohort 3 for early infantile GM1 treated with low dose PBGM01, and Cohort 4 for early infantile GM1 treated with high dose PBGM01.
​
In December 2022 and February 2023, we reported interim safety and biomarker data for the first three cohorts of our Imagine-1 trial. The safety data showed that PBGM01 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no evidence of dorsal root ganglion toxicity or complications related to the ICM injection. We observed a dose-dependent increase in β-gal activity in the cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, coupled with a dose-dependent decrease in CSF levels of GM1 ganglioside. We also reported meaningful improvement in a subset of patients across developmental areas in assessments utilizing the Vineland II and Bayley III scales, performed by caregivers and trained healthcare providers, respectively. The data suggests that stage of disease may be a determinant in treatment outcomes.
​
We expect to report initial safety and biomarker data from patients in Cohort 4 in the middle of 2023.
​
A key objective of the initial phase of the Imagine-1 trial is to determine the optimal dose for the confirmatory phase of the study. Based on the favorable safety profile of PBGM01 observed to date, the observed dose-response in key biomarkers, such as CSF b-gal activity and GM1 ganglioside levels, and that our preclinical studies showed no safety signals at doses higher than currently being evaluated in the ongoing clinical trial, we plan to treat additional patients in the Imagine-1 trial at higher doses of PBMG01 than the doses of PBGM01 administered to date in Cohorts 1 to 4. Following regulatory review, we expect to dose the first patient at a higher dose of PBGM01 in the second half of 2023. 
​
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, or RPDD, and Fast Track Designation, to PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1. The European Commission has granted Orphan designation and Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, or ATMP, designation for PBGM01. 
PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN
We are currently developing PBFT02, which utilizes an AAV1 capsid to deliver a functional copy of the granulin gene, or GRN, encoding for human progranulin, or PGRN, for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia caused by progranulin deficiency, or FTD-GRN. FTD-GRN is an inheritable form of FTD in which patients have mutations in the GRN gene, causing a deficiency in PGRN. PGRN is a complex and highly conserved protein thought to have multiple roles in cell homeostasis, neurodevelopment, and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that PGRN deficiency in FTD and other neurodegenerative disorders may contribute to lysosomal dysfunction. Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD-GRN. Based on findings in preclinical studies, we believe that PBFT02 may provide FTD-GRN patients with significantly improved outcomes. We selected the AAV1 capsid and ICM administration for PBFT02 because this approach led to extensive and robust expression of human PGRN throughout the brain and spinal cord of non-human primates, or NHPs, and due to the higher PGRN levels in CSF using AAV1 as compared with other serotypes tested. ICM administration of AAV1 to NHPs resulted in supraphysiologic CSF levels of human PGRN compared to levels in healthy human subjects’ CSF, and in excess of levels achieved in NHPs with AAVhu68 or AAV5.
​
We have an active IND from the FDA and approved CTAs in multiple countries for PBFT02, which allows us to proceed with our upliFT-D Trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBFT02 in patients with a diagnosis of early symptomatic FTD-GRN.

​
In August 2022, we dosed the first patient in our upliFT-D trial. 
​
We expect to report initial safety and biomarker data from patients in Cohort 1 in the second half of 2023.
​
The FDA has granted ODD and Fast Track Designation to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN and the European Commission granted Orphan designation for PBFT02. 
​
Other Clinical Product Candidates
We have two clinical product candidates, PBKR03 and PBML04, for which, in order to reduce operating expenses, we have stopped further clinical development and are exploring strategic alternatives for these assets.
​
PBKR03 utilizes a proprietary, next-generation AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional GALC gene encoding the hydrolytic enzyme galactosylceramidase to treat Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GALC gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called galactosylceramidase, which breaks down certain fats, including galactosylceramide and psychosine. This results in the accumulation of galactolipids such as psychosine, resulting in widespread death of myelin-producing cells in the CNS and in the peripheral nervous system, or PNS. We have an active IND from the FDA and approved CTAs in multiple countries for PBKR03 to support our GALax-C Trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBKR03 in patients with a diagnosis of infantile Krabbe disease. In March 2022, we dosed the first patient in our GALax-C Trial. In November 2022, we announced plans to stop further clinical development of PBKR03 in order to reduce operating expenses, and are exploring strategic alternatives for this asset.
​
PBML04 utilizes a proprietary, next-generation AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional arylsulfatase A gene, or ARSA, encoding the ARSA enzyme to treat Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, or MLD. MLD is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the ARSA gene, resulting in little or no functional activity of the ARSA enzyme, which is essential for the degradation of sphingolipid cerebroside-3-sulfate, or sulfatide. When the ARSA enzyme is lacking, sulfatides accumulate in lysosomal storage deposits in microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells, leading to widespread demyelination. Our preclinical data in ARSA-/- mice and in NHPs support the ability of PBML04 administration into CSF to result in dose-dependent increases in brain and CSF levels of functional human ARSA enzyme, leading to improved biochemical, histopathological, behavioral, survival endpoints, and with no safety or toxicity signs up to the highest tested dose in NHPs. Preclinical findings were presented by GTP in 2021. In April 2022, we submitted an IND for PBML04 to support clinical development in MLD. On May 20, 2022, the FDA cleared our IND application for PBML04, which supports PBML04-001, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm clinical trial of PBML04 in patients with a diagnosis of late onset infantile MLD. In November 2022, we announced plans to stop further clinical development of PBML04 in order to reduce operating expenses, and are exploring strategic alternatives for this asset.
​
Research Programs
We have two programs in preclinical research stages under our license agreement with Penn: PBAL05 for ALS and, an unnamed program for Huntington’s disease. PBAL05 is targeting patients with ALS who have a gain-of-function mutation in the C9orf72 gene. Our unnamed program is focused on the treatment of Huntington’s disease, a repeat expansion disorder. Beyond this portfolio, through our research collaboration with GTP, we also have the option to license programs for eight additional new indications in CNS diseases along with certain rights and licenses to new gene therapy technologies developed by Penn, such as novel capsids, toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation. 
​
We also have an exploratory research program with GTP for larger non-monogenic indications, currently focused on TLE, which can be expanded to other large CNS diseases upon mutual agreement with GTP.

Our Strategy
We are a genetic medicines company focused on developing transformative therapies for CNS disorders with limited or no approved treatment options. Our vision is to fulfill the promise of gene therapy by developing groundbreaking therapies that transform the lives of patients with CNS diseases.
To achieve our vision, we have assembled a world-class team whose members have decades of collective experience in genetic medicines and rare disease drug development and commercialization. We leverage this experience, to develop treatments that improve outcomes for patients with serious, life-threatening CNS diseases. Patients are considered every step of the way, in every decision we make.
Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Focus on underserved indications for which we can have a transformative impact on patients’ lives. We believe that genetic medicine has the potential to have a transformative impact on CNS disorders, and on patients’ lives, by providing them with a treatment for life-threatening diseases with limited or no approved treatment options. ​
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance our clinical product candidates through clinical development and commercialization. We leverage our collaboration with GTP, as well as our internal capabilities, to select optimal product candidates for each indication based on extensive preclinical data, including animal data and disease-specific animal models and biomarkers, thus enhancing the probability of clinical success of our product candidates. Our goal is to select candidates that have the potential to address high unmet clinical needs and have transformative therapeutic effects for patients. If our clinical trials are successful, we plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory approval strategies. ​

• | Advance and expand our pipeline by identifying and developing additional product candidates into the clinic. We believe our differentiated drug development approach as well as our internal and partnered research capabilities may allow us to address a broad range of CNS disorders, thus expanding our pipeline. Through our collaboration with GTP, we are continuing to develop additional genetic medicine product candidates targeting life-threatening CNS disorders. We have two lead clinical product candidates, two clinical product candidates for which we have stopped further clinical development in order to reduce operating expenses and are exploring strategic alternatives for these assets, and three additional programs advancing through the research or discovery stage. We also have the option to license eight additional CNS indications from GTP until May 2026.

• | Extend existing and establish new relationships with patients and patient advocacy groups. Patients are at the core of what we do. We have been engaging with them and with their advocacy groups since our inception and have acquired an intimate understanding of how we can positively impact their lives. These relationships deeply inform us as we develop and ultimately seek to commercialize our product candidates. Our relationship with Penn’s ODC, which is currently performing a natural history study for GM1 that we are funding, represents an example of our strategy, and has been helping us to engage effectively with patients. We have a collaboration with Invitae to facilitate genetic testing and support early identification of GM1 through Invitae’s Detect Lysosomal Storage Disorders, as well as provide clinical trial information to physicians and patients, and have partnered with InformedDNA to offer free genetic counseling and testing for adults who have been diagnosed with FTD.

• | Continue to develop proprietary manufacturing capabilities. We believe the quality, reliability and scalability of our genetic medicine manufacturing techniques and know-how will be a critical advantage to our long-term success. We have established robust in-house analytical and process development operations to support ongoing and future manufacturing operations. We have also advanced our manufacturing and testing technology platforms; our in-house laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art analytical capabilities, capable of assay development and validation, clinical product testing, and process and product development to support viral vector manufacturing. We also have the internal manufacturing

and quality expertise to oversee external manufacturing and supply chain operations provided by third party strategic relationships, such as Catalent Maryland, a unit of Catalent Biologics, Inc, or Catalent. We also have access to a manufacturing suite through Catalent where we have successfully produced GMP material for our clinical programs. This facility is capable of producing sufficient supplies to conduct our planned clinical trials and, supply initial commercial launch of our current clinical product candidates, if approved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively enter into new discovery relationships with premier research institutions and expand our existing collaboration. We will continue to foster our well-established relationship with Penn, and potentially enter into new collaborations to build or advance our pipeline. We will look to nurture our genetic medicine technology capabilities by keeping abreast of advances in next-generation capsid development, promoter selection, transgene design, gene silencing and gene editing, which will help us to engineer optimal product profiles to address life-threating CNS disorders characterized by high unmet medical needs.

Genetic Medicine Background
Each person’s genetic material, or genome, consists of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, in sequences of genetic code called genes. The DNA in the human genome contains approximately three billion nucleotide base pairs, and small changes, or mutations, routinely occur in the base pairs. A mutation in a single gene can alter the amount or activity of the protein expressed by the gene, causing deformities and disease. Currently, there are estimated to be over 10,000 diseases caused by a genetic abnormality in a single gene. These are also known as monogenic diseases. Based on research commissioned by us, we believe there are at least 790 rare monogenic CNS diseases, with few currently approved disease modifying treatments for any rare monogenic CNS diseases. In addition, gene therapy can also be applied to correct biological pathways that are not necessarily inherited or associated with one defective gene. This approach aims to reduce the expression of pathological proteins or increase the production of corrective biological targets. This is the basis for the programs that target non-hereditary conditions such as TLE.
The development of molecular therapeutics to modulate human gene expression and correct disease-causing genetic defects had its advent several decades ago, and with advances in science and a deeper understanding of human genetics it has expanded to include a broader range of genetic medicines with the potential to modulate gene expression through additional molecular mechanisms.
These transformative genetic medicines include gene therapy (delivery of an external gene to replace a defective gene), gene silencing (delivery of a DNA or ribonucleic acid, or RNA, based therapeutic that modulates the transcription or translation of an injurious gene product), gene editing (delivery of a DNA or RNA-based therapeutic that corrects the expression of targeted genes) and combinations of these therapeutic modalities. We believe that this expanded molecular biological tool-box will provide new therapeutics with the potential to deliver highly potent and safe interventions across a diverse set of CNS diseases, offering several advantages, including:

• | Potential to treat most diseases of genetic etiology. Theoretically, it should be possible to design and deliver a genetic medicine to correct the expression of any human protein whose presence, absence or activity causes disease. ​
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to target mechanisms that have not been effectively or safely modulated by traditional small molecule or protein-based therapeutics. The inherent specificity of genetic medicines for unique nucleic acid sequences can provide a high therapeutic index resulting from high potency and the potential to deliver adequate doses while avoiding off-target safety liabilities. ​
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficient delivery of transformative therapeutics. Because genetic medicines are designed to deliver a long-standing effect following a single administration, a single dose of these therapeutics has the potential to provide clinical benefits for many years. ​
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Genetic medicines can be designed to mitigate challenges faced by other approaches in the development of therapeutics for the CNS. CNS disorders are among the most devastating in their impact on patients and their families. These disorders are generally life-threatening to patients. There is a significant need for genetic 

10



medicines that can target these disorders. Our initial programs focus on rare, monogenic CNS disorders because they offer a compelling opportunity for the effective application of genetic medicines. 
​
Our Approach
The field of genetic medicine is rapidly expanding and we believe we have developed a differentiated approach to developing treatments for CNS disorders that allows us to select and advance product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success. Our gene therapy product candidates use AAV, a small, non-pathogenic virus that is genetically engineered to function as a delivery vehicle, or vector. In our current clinical programs, the AAV is administered to a patient to introduce a healthy copy of a mutated gene, or the transgene, to the cells in a process referred to as transduction. Our current approaches use AAVs to deliver either a (i) replacement non-mutant transgene, or (ii) a combination of a microRNA, known as miRNA, to reduce expression of a mutant transgene, and a replacement non-mutant transgene. The components of an AAV gene therapy vector include the therapeutic gene that makes up the DNA payload, or the transgene, the outer viral shell that encloses the DNA payload, or the capsid, and any promotors added to the vector to boost expression of the transgene. The AAV is often described by the serotype, or strain, of the vector. The core tenets of our approach include a rigorous process for selecting product candidates, mitigation of early development risk through relationships with leading researchers and academic institutions, and mitigation of clinical development risk through deep relationships with patient advocacy groups, key opinion leaders and practitioners. Together, these relationships allow us to directly benefit from decades of collective experience, the latest technologies and contemporary perspectives from patients and their experiences. 
​
Rigorous Process for Selecting Product Candidates
In selecting our product candidates, we focus initially on optimizing transduction and expression of transgenes in the indication-specific target tissues. This involves prioritizing the following principles: selection of the route of administration to maximize transgene biodistribution; selection of capsid, transgene and promoter to optimize efficiency of transduction and expression; leveraging biological mechanisms such as cross-correction to maximize availability of transgene product to target cells; and the effective use of biomarkers to assess treatment effects on transduction, transgene expression and on disease pathophysiology.

• | Optimal route of administration: Identifying the optimal route of administration for AAV gene therapy is critical to achieving safe and effective levels of transgene expression in the targeted location in the CNS. The optimal route of administration for CNS treatments should also leverage the immuno-privileged aspects of the CNS to reduce the potential effects of neutralizing antibodies, or NAbs, on AAV capsids, which are often faced by gene therapy product candidates. We evaluate preclinical studies and other data to decide the preferred route of administration on a program-by-program basis. For our existing clinical product candidates, we believe that ICM administration is the optimal route of administration as compared to other potential delivery mechanisms due to its diffuse delivery distribution, potential for improved biodistribution to the brain and spinal cord and transduction, and lower expected toxicity. Administration through ICM can also reduce the potential impact of NAbs as compared with intravenous administration. We believe that by using ICM we can achieve comparable protein expression at lower dosages than would be required by other administration routes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capsid, transgene, and promoter selection: For each of our programs, we conduct rigorous studies to select the capsid, transgene, and promoter to use for our product candidate. We identify the optimal AAV gene therapy for each of our indications depending on the target indication, our goal of CNS and/or PNS transduction, and the target brain regions and cell types. Typically, we compare multiple capsids in NHPs to identify the capsid best suited for each program.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cross-correction: Our existing clinical product candidates exploit the cross-correction mechanism by which secreted gene product from transduced cells is taken up by non-transduced neurons. We believe this cross-correction mechanism can help overcome the limits of vector biodistribution and CNS transduction inefficiency that are characteristic of other genetic medicine approaches, and ultimately drive clinical benefit. ​
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




• | Effective use of biomarkers: Our development program targets must have measurable, predictive biomarkers to inform early and efficient clinical development decisions. These include pharmacodynamic biomarkers to confirm achievement of target levels of transduction and gene expression, and disease activity and progression biomarkers to confirm downstream effects on the underlying disease pathophysiology. ​

Mitigation of Early Development Risk of Programs Prior to IND submission
We have a strategic research collaboration with GTP, which is led by our co-founder and Chief Scientific Advisor, Dr. Wilson, and which we believe positions us at the forefront of gene therapy research. This collaboration provides us with access to differentiated discovery technology and expertise that informs the basis of our product candidate selection and subsequent development.
Our strategic research collaboration with GTP provides us with access until August 2026 to one of the premier gene therapy research institutes in the world for the discovery and preclinical development of gene therapy product candidates and exclusive rights to certain CNS disorders, including next-generation AAV capsid technology and vector engineering, and state-of-the art preclinical animal studies, including NHP models. Through GTP’s staff, we have access to cutting edge expertise and capabilities in gene therapy research and preclinical development.
Our collaboration with GTP allows us to choose programs that have been or will be validated through extensive testing in preclinical disease models, and once selected, to collaborate with GTP on further preclinical optimization of our product candidate, such as vector choice, transgene construct and route of administration. We believe this collaboration improves our probability of technical and regulatory success in developing product candidates that provide transformative clinical benefits.
Once we select a particular CNS indication for further development, GTP, with our close involvement and oversight, embarks on a rational discovery and development program to design product candidates that may provide improved clinical benefit. We usually evaluate transduction efficiency and biodistribution using multiple different capsids in NHPs to select the capsid best suited for the targeted indication. GTP also works to optimize the delivery method used for each product candidate by balancing delivery, efficacy, safety, host immunity and ease of administration. We believe the translational preclinical characterization provided by GTP, including the use of NHP models for vector screening and toxicology, reduces the early-stage development risk of our product candidates.
Mitigation of Clinical Development Risk through Our Relationship with Penn’s ODC
We also have a strong relationship with Penn’s ODC. As part of our research collaboration with GTP, we have access to Penn’s ODC’s insights and capabilities in the study of rare diseases. We leverage our close working relationship with Penn’s ODC to develop historical and prospective external data for each disease for use in building comparable patient profiles of participants in interventional trials. Penn’s ODC is currently performing a natural history study for GM1 funded by us.
Our Product Candidates
GM1—PBGM01
Overview of GM1
GM1 is a rare and often life-threatening monogenic recessive lysosomal storage disease that results in progressive damage to both the CNS and the peripheral tissues. The infantile form of the disease is characterized by onset in the first two years of life with symptoms including hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), progressive CNS dysfunction leading to deafness, blindness, enlarged liver and spleen, rigidity and progressive skeletal dysplasia that leads to restrictive lung disease and aspiration pneumonia. Early onset infantile GM1, or Type I, is characterized by onset in the first six months of life, while late onset infantile GM1, or Type IIa, is characterized by onset between six and 24 months. The disease rapidly progresses, with a life expectancy of less than two years for early infantile GM1 and five to ten years for late infantile GM1.
12



GM1 is caused by recessive mutations in the GLB1 gene, which encodes lysosomal acid β-gal, an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the natural degradation of GM1 ganglioside as well as other glycan substrates. Reduced β-gal activity results in the accumulation of toxic levels of GM1 ganglioside in neurons throughout the brain, causing rapidly progressing neurodegeneration. GM1 manifests as a continuum of clinical severity, ranging from infants with earlier onset and more severe and rapidly progressive disease to those with later juvenile or adult onset, slower progression and less severe manifestations.
The United States incidence of GM1 has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 100,000 live births, with infantile GM1 representing approximately 62.5% of such cases. No states include GM1 in mandatory infant screening. We engaged a third-party data-analytics firm to conduct an analysis of a variety of de-identified electronic medical records. Based on this analysis, we estimate the incidence of infantile GM1 to be approximately 1.4 in 100,000 live births. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies available. Supportive treatment options include the use of feeding tubes or ventilators for infants with GM1.
Program selection
We chose GM1 as one of our initial lead programs because it met our criteria for rare, monogenic CNS disorders in which we believe we can develop product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success that will substantially impact on the lives of severely underserved patients. Several key factors supported the decision to focus on GM1 for AAV gene therapy, as described below.

• | Cross-correction: Following treatment with PBGM01, we expect that newly synthesized functional β-gal will be secreted by transduced cells and provide a source of secreted proteins that could be taken up by surrounding non-transduced and otherwise enzyme-deficient cells. This cellular cross-correction could therefore lead to enzyme replacement broadly throughout the CNS and peripheral organs. ​
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biomarkers: There are known biomarkers in GM1 that are measurable and available to assist in drug development. ​
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | β-gal activity. Reduced β-gal activity is a hallmark of GM1 and treatment with PBGM01 is expected to restore this activity. To this end, β-gal activity is being measured in CSF and blood.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Reduced β-gal activity results in the accumulation of GM1 ganglioside and other glycan substrates in neurons throughout the brain. These substrates may be reduced following treatment with PBGM01 and are being measured in CSF, blood, and urine. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Disease progression biomarkers. Recent MRI studies of infants with GM1 have shown longitudinal changes in MRI in infants with GM1 consistent with progressive brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement, suggesting that brain MRI would be a useful biomarker to detect and help verify treatment effects on disease pathophysiology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preclinical validation: We used the GLB1 knockout mouse disease model showing clinical, biological and histological manifestations of GM1 in preclinical studies. In these studies, we observed a robust dose-related improvement in both neurological status, enzyme activity, histologic lysosomal storage pathology and survival following treatment with PBGM01. ​

Product Candidate Development Strategy
We have chosen the earliest and most severe form of GM1 for clinical development for several reasons. Within GM1, infantile GM1 represents the greatest medical need, as early onset GM1 infants often do not survive past two years, and thus are in immediate need of an effective therapy. We expect treatment-related efficacy to be measurable sooner after treatment in this more rapidly progressing form of GM1. Patients with onset forms of GM1 later than infantile, which we define as an onset later than 24 months, are caused by less severe reductions of β-gal enzyme activity and generally demonstrate slower progression and more variable clinical courses, likely requiring larger and longer clinical trials and a broader control group. If our initial clinical trials in infantile GM1 are successful, we intend to explore expansion of the indication with trials in later onset forms of GM1.

Our Product Candidate
We are developing PBGM01 to treat infantile GM1, with a single dose of PBGM01 by ICM administration. PBGM01 utilizes a next-generation AAVhu68 viral vector to deliver modified DNA encoding the β-gal enzyme to a patient’s cells. The goal of this vector and delivery approach is to increase levels of the β-gal enzyme in both the CNS and the peripheral tissues. We selected the AAVhu68 capsid and ICM route of administration due to the superior transduction observed in cells of the CNS and peripheral organs, which are both affected in GM1 disease patients. Based on prior capsid comparison studies, the AAVhu68 vector has the potential to provide corrective β-gal enzyme to both the CNS and peripheral tissues, which we believe gives us the potential to treat both the CNS pathologies and the peripheral manifestations observed in GM1 disease.
We believe gene replacement with PBGM01 and consequent wide brain distribution and uptake of the β-gal enzyme has the potential to greatly reduce the accumulation of GM1 gangliosides, reversing neuronal toxicity, thereby restoring developmental potential and improving the quality of life for treated patients. We will evaluate this clinically by assessing the prevention of further developmental regression and restoration of developmental trajectories, as measured by developmental milestones using accepted clinical scales and observer-reported outcomes.
Preclinical studies
The potential for efficacy of PBGM01 is supported by preclinical findings in GLB1 knockout (GLB1-/-) mice. This mouse line develops several characteristics that are reminiscent of the neurological presentation of GM1, including a rapid accumulation of GM1 ganglioside in the brain shortly after birth followed by progressive motor abnormalities and a shortened survival. Intracerebroventricular, or ICV, injection of PBGM01 in GLB1-/- mice resulted in persistent dose-dependent elevations in β-gal activity in the brain, CSF, serum, and in peripheral organs. Increased β-gal activity was associated with increased phenotypic and histopathological benefits in the GLB1-/- mice including the resolution of pre-existing brain lysosomal storage lesions as assessed by lysosomal associated membrane protein 1, or LAMP-1, immunohistochemistry, improved neurological phenotypes in assays of clinical deficits and animals’ gait, and increased survival. Preclinical findings were published by GTP in 2020.
​
NHP Toxicology Study 
​
A 120-day good laboratory practice, or GLP, compliant toxicology study conducted in NHPs assessed the safety, tolerability, biodistribution and excretion profile of PBGM01 following ICM administration of vehicle or one of three dose levels of PBGM01. PBGM01 vector distributed to the CSF and high levels of gene transfer were detected in the brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, or DRG. The quantity of vector genomes detected in CNS tissues was generally dose-dependent. PBGM01 also reached high levels in peripheral blood and liver. Measurement of transgene expression by β-gal activity in CSF and serum was limited in NHPs by the nature of the assay, which could not distinguish between human and endogenous rhesus β-gal. 
β-gal activity in the CSF and serum was detectable in animals from all dose groups 14 days after PBGM01 administration. In the CSF, animals administered the two higher doses displayed dose-dependent increases in β-gal activity to approximately two-fold and four-fold higher than the levels in vehicle-treated controls, respectively.
​
There were no blood or CSF abnormalities related to PBGM01 administration except for asymptomatic, mild, and transient increases in CSF leukocytes in the majority of animals from all dose groups. PBGM01 was well-tolerated at all doses evaluated and no adverse effects were detected on body weight or clinical, neurological, or behavioral signs. PBGM01 vector DNA was detectable in urine and feces five days post-administration and was undetectable within 60 days. In response to a potential AAV platform risk reported in NHPs we assayed DRG and TRG toxicity after PBGM01 administration. Mild and transient degeneration of DRGs, TRGs, and associated sensory nerve axonopathy were observed in all dose groups; however, these findings were not linked with any clinical or neurological abnormalities in any animals up to 120 days post-dose.
​

14



In summary, based on our preclinical studies, we believe that CSF delivery of PBGM01 has the potential to sufficiently increase β-gal levels in both the CNS and in peripheral tissues to overcome intracellular β-gal deficiency in GM1.
​
Clinical development
Our clinical development plan is to start with trials in infantile GM1, and if successful, explore expansion of the indication with trials in later onset forms of GM1.
We initiated patient dosing in our Imagine-1 trial, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBGM01 in patients with a diagnosis of early and late infantile GM1 in March 2021. Primary endpoints include safety and efficacy. Efficacy is being evaluated by the assessment of developmental milestones using accepted clinical scales and observer-reported outcomes. Secondary outcomes include serum and CSF β-gal enzyme activity, GM1 ganglioside levels, and disease progression endpoints including evaluations using electroencephalogram, or EEG, and MRI.
The study enrolled both early and late infantile patients in separate, smaller cohorts. Part 1 of the study includes a total of four cohorts of two patients each, with separate dose-escalation cohorts for late onset infantile GM1 patients, defined as onset prior to 24 months in age and after 6 months in age, and early onset infantile GM1, defined as onset prior to 6 months of age. The study is assessing an initial low dose (3.3x10˄10 genome copies/gm brain weight) that exceeds the minimum effective dose, or MED, as determined in our preclinical studies, and a 3-fold greater high dose (1.1x10˄11 genome copies/gm brain weight). Cohorts 1 and 2 enrolled patients diagnosed with late infantile GM1 and treated them with low dose and high dose PBGM01, respectively, while Cohorts 3 and 4 enrolled patients diagnosed with early infantile GM1 and treated them with low dose and high dose PBGM01, respectively. All patients are treated with an abbreviated course of low dose steroids. To better understand the clinical significance of the peripheral nerve findings in NHPs, we implemented clinical monitoring in our Imagine-1 trial, consisting of both nerve conduction studies and neurological exams focused on sensory and peripheral nerve function. There is a 60-day interval between all subjects dosed within a cohort to allow review of biomarker and safety data before dosing the next subject. 
Following the dose-escalation cohorts, each patient population will be enrolled into a confirmatory cohort. Patients will be evaluated over two years for safety and efficacy, followed by an additional 36 months of long-term follow up.
Clinical development results
We completed dosing of the initial four cohorts in our Imagine-1 trial in November 2022. In December 2022 and February 2023, we reported interim safety and biomarker data for the first three cohorts of the trial. The results from the interim assessment are shown below and include clinical data from the first three cohorts with follow-up from three to eighteen months based on data as of December 2022.
​
PBGM01 was well tolerated, with a positive safety profile, no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and all treatment-related adverse events, or AEs, were mild to moderate in severity. There were no clinically significant changes in liver function requiring intervention and no evidence of peripheral nerve toxicity as measured by nerve conduction studies and neurological exam. There was also a favorable immunological profile with no evidence of an immune response requiring changes to the immunosuppression regimen. As anticipated, moderate levels of Nabs developed to capsid in blood and low levels of NAbs to capsid were also detected in CSF. No antibodies were detected to the transgene product in either the CSF or serum. There were also no complications related to the ICM administration.
​
The six patients enrolled in Cohorts 1 to 3 ranged from 6 to 31 months of age at the time of PBGM01 administration. Across the first three cohorts, PBGM01 administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in CSF β-gal activity with the high dose resulting in a 3.6-5.2x increase in CSF β-gal activity relative to baseline, well above levels observed in the Natural History Study being conducted by the University of Pennsylvania ODC. In patient 1, who was observed with the longest follow-up, increased CSF β-gal activity was sustained for 12 months. Sustained β-gal enzyme expression was also observed in blood.

​
​
To assess pharmacodynamic activity in the CNS associated with b-gal activity, GM1 gangliosides levels were measured in the CSF. GM1 gangliosides are hypothesized to mediate CNS manifestation of disease. PBGM01 administration resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in CSF GM1 ganglioside levels for patients in the high dose cohort, showing decreases of up to 75% at six months. GM1 ganglioside levels in the CSF were unchanged following the administration for patients in the low dose cohort.
​
Clinical assessments include the Bayley III and Vineland II scales, performed by trained healthcare providers and the patients caregivers, respectively. The scales assess the developmental age of the child across a broad range of clinical parameters. The patients treated with PBGM01 exhibited a broad range of developmental age at baseline, as assessed with the Bayley III, as well a wide range of developmental delay, which is determined by the patients chronological age minus their developmental age. Two patients, patients 1 and 5, exhibited developmental delay of 2 and 5.5 months, respectively, which we have characterized as mild-to-moderate delay. The remaining patients exhibited developmental delay ranging from 12 to 24 months, which we have characterized as marked delay.
​

16



​
Following treatment with PBGM01, we observed that patients with a lower developmental delay at dosing experienced a better clinical response to treatment, regardless of dosage level. On both the Bayley III and the Vineland II, the two patients with mild-to-moderate developmental delay at baseline show improvement in their developmental age over time, which contrasts with the plateau and subsequent regression generally expected based on the natural history of the disease. The remaining patients with more marked developmental delay show stabilization or limited improvement. Based on this data, we believe that milder developmental delay at the time of dosing may be a determinant in treatment outcomes.

​
Treatment effects on brain volume and white matter integrity are being assessed using a MRI severity score, a novel scoring metric, for GM1 patients based on baseline and follow-up brain MRI scans. The MRI severity score is based on cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, abnormalities in white matter, and signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia and hippocampi, where higher scores indicate more structural damage. In a natural history study with six late infantile GM1 patients, the MRI severity score increased in the majority of patients over the follow up period of six months to four years, implying progression of structural damage. In contrast, PBGM01 administration was associated with stabilization of the MRI severity score over the follow up period of six to twelve months. While the PBGM01 data is for a shorter period of time than the natural history study data, we believe the initial trend observed, if continued, may be an important indicator of biological activity.

​
​
Initial biomarker and safety data from Cohort 4 are expected to be reported in the middle of 2023.
​
A key objective of the initial phase of the Imagine-1 trial is to determine the optimal dose for the confirmatory phase of the study. Based on the favorable safety profile of PBGM01 to date, the observed dose-response in key biomarkers, such as CSF b-gal activity and GM1 ganglioside levels, and that our preclinical studies showed no safety signals at doses higher than currently being evaluated in the ongoing clinical trial, we plan to treat additional patients in the Imagine-1 trial at higher doses of PBGM01 than the doses of PBGM01 administered to date in cohorts 1 to 4. Following regulatory review, we expect to dose the first patient at a higher dose of PBGM01 in the second half of 2023.
​
Based on the available data in the Imagine-1 trial to date, we believe that patients with more limited developmental delay at the time of enrollment may have better outcomes. As we consider our pivotal trial design and potential modifications to the ongoing trial, we are revising inclusion criteria to maximize the benefit-risk profile of PBGM01.
​
As our clinical data matures, we are planning for continued interactions with regulatory authorities to align on design of the confirmatory study and appropriate pathway to submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, and regulatory approval for commercialization in the United States and internationally.
Natural History Data
We are currently funding a GM1 natural history study being conducted by Penn’s ODC to collect prospective data on clinical disease progression in infantile and juvenile GM1. This data, supplemented with data from retrospective studies, will be used to construct natural history patient profiles for comparison to the profiles of treated participants in our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
Regulatory Designations
The FDA has granted ODD, RPDD, and Fast Track Designation to PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1. The European Commission has granted Orphan designation and Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, or ATMP, designation for PBGM01.

Clinical Supply
Through our manufacturing partners, we have manufactured the PBGM01 clinical supply and have established a clinical supply chain to support our ongoing clinical trial activities. 
FTD—PBFT02
Overview of FTD-GRN
FTD is one of the more common causes of early-onset dementia, occurring with a median age of 55 years. FTD presents as a rapidly progressive clinical syndrome and causes impairment in behavior, language, and executive function. Changes in personal and social conduct occur in early stages of the disease, including loss of inhibition, apathy, social withdrawal, hyperorality and ritualistic compulsive behaviors. These symptoms are severely disabling and may lead to misdiagnosis as a psychological or emotionally based problem, or, in the elderly, be mistaken for withdrawal or eccentricity. FTD progresses to immobility and loss of speech and expression. Survival averages eight years after onset of symptoms.
In approximately 5% to 10% of individuals with FTD, the disease is caused by mutations in the granulin, or GRN, gene, causing a deficiency of progranulin. PGRN is a complex and highly conserved protein thought to have multiple roles in cell biology, development and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that PGRN’s pathogenic contribution to FTD and other neurodegenerative disorders relates to a critical role in lysosomal function.
There are no disease modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD. Anti-depressants have been shown to manage some behavioral symptoms. We engaged a third-party data-analytics firm to conduct an analysis of a variety of de-identified electronic medical records. Based on this analysis, we estimate the prevalence of FTD in the United States to be approximately 62,000. The prevalence of FTD due to GRN mutation found in literature is 5% to 10%. Accordingly, we estimate the prevalence of FTD-GRN deficiency in the United States to be approximately 3,000 to 6,000.
Program selection
We chose FTD-GRN as one of our initial lead programs because it meets our criteria for rare, monogenic CNS disorders in which we believe we can develop product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success:

• | Cross-correction: Following treatment with PBFT02, overexpressing PGRN in a subset of cells in the CNS could provide a source of secreted protein that could be taken up by surrounding cells, resulting in the potential for cross-correction and broad restoration of neuronal lysosomal function across the entire brain. ​
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biomarkers: There are known biomarkers in FTD-GRN that are measurable and available to assist in drug development. ​
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PGRN is a secreted protein that can be measured in the CSF and plasma, and it has been shown to be reduced in the CSF of human GRN mutation carriers. ​
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Disease progression biomarkers. We expect to be able to use recent progress in the identification of clinical disease progression biomarkers for FTD, including CSF, neuroimaging and retinal biomarkers, to facilitate clinical development by enabling early detection of treatment effects on disease pathophysiology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preclinical Validation: In our preclinical studies in GRN knockout mice, or GRN -/- mice, ICV administration of PBFT02 resulted in increased levels of PGRN in the CNS and CSF, with resolution of lysosomal storage pathology. ICM administration in NHPs, which do not have the disease phenotype, resulted in robust increases in PGRN levels in CNS and CSF.

Our Product Candidate
We are developing PBFT02 to treat patients affected with FTD-GRN with a single dose of PBFT02 by ICM administration. PBFT02 is a gene therapy that utilizes an AAV1 viral vector to deliver a modified DNA encoding the GRN gene to a patient’s cells. The goal of this vector and delivery approach is to provide higher than normal levels of PGRN to the CNS to overcome the progranulin deficiency in GRN mutation carriers, who have been observed to have reduced CSF PGRN levels ranging from 30% to 50% of the PGRN levels observed in normal, mutation non-carriers. We selected the AAV1 capsid and ICM administration route due to the widespread and robust expression of the human PGRN transgene observed throughout the brain and spinal cord in NHP studies. Following AAV1 administration in NHP levels of human PGRN in the CSF achieved supraphysiologic levels compared to those measured in healthy human CSF and exceeded PGRN levels observed in NHPs that received AAV5 or AAVhu68 serotypes by greater than 5 times. 
Preclinical studies
PBFT02 was selected as our development candidate following a study in adult NHPs which evaluated the expression of human PGRN protein in the CSF after ICM administration of four different vector constructs. The AAV1 vector construct produced supraphysiological levels of PGRN and greater than 5 times higher than the other vectors tested, as shown below. ICM AAV1 did not strongly transduce the liver or significantly elevate levels of circulating PGRN, which may reduce the potential for unknown peripheral effects of PGRN. Proof of concept findings were published by GTP in 2020. 
​
​
Comparison of Vector Serotypes: Production of Human PGRN-protein in CSF of NHPs following ICM-AAV administration.
​
​
The efficacy of the AAV1 vector was assayed in a dose-ranging study in GRN -/- mice. PBFT02 was administered via ICV delivery to adult mice at an age when lipofuscin deposition (a marker of lysosomal dysfunction), lysosomal enzyme abnormalities, and neuroinflammation were present in brain regions involved in FTD-GRN pathophysiology. Human PGRN expression in the CSF increased in a dose-dependent manner following PBFT02 administration. Transgene expression led to improvements in histopathologic and enzymatic changes in key brain regions in the mice, including a reduction in the accumulation of lipofuscin and reduced neuroinflammation (as shown in below figure), and elevated lysosomal hexosaminidase activity.

​
NHP Toxicology Study 
​
A 90-day GLP compliant toxicology study conducted in NHPs assessed the safety, tolerability, biodistribution and excretion profile of PBFT02 following ICM administration at three dose levels. There were no blood or CSF abnormalities related to PBFT02 administration except for asymptomatic, mild, and transient increases in CSF leukocytes in the majority of animals. PBFT02 was well-tolerated at all doses evaluated and no adverse effects were detected on body weight or clinical, neurological, or behavioral signs. Vector distributed to the CSF and high levels of gene transfer were detected in the brain, spinal cord and DRG at Day 90. The quantity of vector genomes detected in CNS tissues was generally dose-dependent. PBFT02 also reached significant concentrations in the peripheral blood, liver and spleen. PBFT02 vector DNA was detectable in urine and feces 5 days post-administration and was undetectable within 60 days. 
​
Human PGRN was detectable in CSF and serum in all animals by 7 to 14 days after PBFT02 administration, peaking between Days 14 to 28. Responses were generally dose dependent and resulted in supraphysiologic PGRN levels after the 2 highest doses. Expression declined by Day 60, correlating with the appearance of antibodies against the human transgene product, which are not expected to develop in haploinsufficient patients with FTD-GRN. 
​
Mild to minimal grade transient degeneration of DRGs and TRGs, and associated sensory nerve axonopathy, were observed in all PBFT02 dose groups. These histopathologic observations were not linked with any clinical or neurological abnormalities in any animals up to 90 days’ post-dose. One PBFT02-treated animal exhibited a peripheral nerve conduction impairment in the median nerve, as detected by bilateral reductions in sensory nerve action potential, or SNAP, amplitudes on Day 28 and Day 90, that appeared to be treatment related as severe axon loss and endoneurial fibrosis were detected at necropsy. PBFT02-induced SNAP changes and sensory neuron degeneration were not associated with any clinical or neurological abnormalities in any animals up to 90 days post-dose.
In summary, our preclinical studies demonstrated that CSF delivery of PBFT02 has the potential to safely increase extracellular PGRN levels in the CNS up to supraphysiologic levels and has the potential to improve histopathologic and enzymatic changes in key brain regions associated with FTD.
​
​

21



Clinical development
Our clinical development plan is to treat FTD-GRN with a single dose of PBFT02 via ICM administration, with our initial clinical trial focused on early symptomatic FTD patients who have the GRN mutation.
​
​This trial is expected to be a two-cohort dose-escalation trial, with three subjects per cohort, and with a potential for a third higher-dose cohort, if considered necessary based on the results of the first two cohorts. The planned starting dose (3.3x10˄10 genome copies/gm brain weight) will exceed the MED in the GRN knockout mouse model, with planned escalation to a higher dose (1.1x10˄11 genome copies/gm brain weight). The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess safety and tolerability over 60 months. To better understand the clinical significance of the peripheral nerve findings in NHPs, we implemented clinical monitoring in our uplift-D interventional trial, consisting of both nerve conduction studies and neurological exams focused on sensory and peripheral nerve function. Secondary endpoints are to assess change from baseline to 24 months on biomarkers, including CSF and plasma progranulin levels, biomarkers of neurodegeneration and disease progression, and on clinical outcomes as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating, or CDR, for improving evaluation of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or FTLD, or CDR®, plus NACC FTLD, and other neurocognitive assessments. Interim analyses are planned for certain biomarkers starting at one month post dosing and for clinical outcomes beginning at one year post dosing. The independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, will review 30-day biomarker data and safety data for each subject in a cohort. All subjects will be followed for a total of five years to monitor safety and selected biomarker and efficacy measures. All subjects will be evaluated over two years for safety and efficacy, followed by an additional 36 months of long-term follow up.
A scientific advice meeting with MHRA was held in November 2020, providing feedback on our proposed protocol. Feedback was also obtained from other regulatory agencies outside the United States.
​
In August 2022, we dosed the first patient in our upliFT-D trial. 
​
We expect to report initial safety and biomarker data from patients in Cohort 1 in the second half of 2023.
​
Depending on the results from the initial cohorts, we plan to obtain input from regulatory agencies on the requirements to submit for regulatory approval for commercialization in the United States and internationally.
​
Regulatory designations and Clinical Trial Approvals
We have an active IND from the FDA and approved CTAs in multiple countries for PBFT02, which allows us to proceed with our upliFT-D Trial, an international, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PBFT02 in patients with a diagnosis of early symptomatic FTD-GRN. 
​
The FDA has granted ODD and Fast Track Designation to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN and the European Commission granted Orphan designation for PBFT02. 
Clinical Supply
Through our manufacturing partners, we have manufactured the PBFT02 clinical supply to support ongoing clinical trial activities.
Other Research Programs
We have two additional programs in candidate selection or discovery stages of preclinical research, in collaboration with GTP. These include PBAL05 for ALS and our unnamed program for Huntington’s disease.
Overview of C9orf72 ALS - PBAL05
​
C9orf72-mediated Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or C9orf72 ALS, is an adult-onset, rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease characterized by dysfunction and death of upper and lower motor neurons leading to progressive weakness, loss of motor function, and death typically within three to five years of disease onset. Most cases of ALS are sporadic with an unknown etiology, but approximately 10% of patients have autosomal 

22



dominantly inherited forms. We are focusing on C9orf72-mediated ALS, since mutations in the C9orf72 gene are the most common mutation found in ALS patients including both familial (approximately 40% of familial ALS cases) and sporadic ALS cases (approximately 8% of sporadic ALS patients carry C9orf72 mutations), accounting for approximately 11% of all ALS cases. In 2021, the total number of prevalent C9orf72 ALS cases was estimated to be approximately 4,500 worldwide. In these cases, the disease is caused by a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of C9orf72. The pathogenic mechanism of C9orf72 mutations is not yet proven, but three potential mechanisms predominate, which are toxic gain of function arising from deposition of transcribed atypical dipepetide repeat proteins, and/or deposition of mutant ribonucleic acid, or RNA, and/or loss of function of endogenous proteins.
Our approach is to use a single AAV vector to deliver a miRNA and a codon-optimized miRNA-resistant C9orf72 transgene combination, to both deplete normal and mutant mRNA within cells with the miRNA and to replace with functional wildtype human transgene. This program is currently at the discovery stage.
Unnamed Research Program
With GTP we have one additional specified research program, to develop a genetic medicine to treat Huntington’s disease. This program, initiated in 2021, is currently in the discovery stage. Beyond this portfolio, through our research collaboration with GTP, we also have the option to license programs for eight additional indications.
Exploratory Research Program
We have an exploratory research program with GTP with the goal of developing genetic medicines for non-rare CNS disorders. The program is currently focused on treatment-resistant TLE, and can be expanded to other large CNS diseases upon mutual agreement with GTP.
Manufacturing
Gene therapy manufacturing is a critical factor in the successful development and commercialization of novel genetic medicines, and to that end, we have established internal CMC capabilities to support our vector manufacturing and production platform and we have a relationship with Catalent, a contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, for our initial manufacturing needs.
We utilize a production platform approach with HEK293 mammalian cells as the substrate, triple plasmid transient transfection and single-use fixed-bed iCELLis® bioreactor system for the manufacture of our AAV product candidates. We are using a well-characterized production platform that has been used for both commercial and clinical AAV products and product candidates. We believe our approach will enable rapid development, control of product quality and regulatory compliance.
We have invested significantly in our internal laboratory capabilities and infrastructure to support the manufacturing of our clinical product candidates. Our in-house laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art analytical and process development capabilities to support and enhance our viral vector manufacturing platform. We have developed the internal technical and scientific capability along with the manufacturing and quality expertise to develop, transfer, and oversee vector production systems externally at commercial scale. We believe our capabilities provide a core strategic advantage and position us to be a leading drug development company to address CNS disorders. 
GTP currently provides us with the preclinical and toxicology research-grade vector supplies, while Catalent provides us with the cGMP AAV clinical supplies for our clinical trials. The production process for our two lead clinical stage product candidates, PBGM01 and PBFT02, and for the two clinical stage product candidates for which we have stopped clinical development, PBKR03 and PBML04, has been scaled up to GMP standards at Catalent’s facility. Clinical materials for these candidates have been manufactured.
We have a collaboration agreement with Catalent, or the Collaboration Agreement, that gives us access to a cGMP manufacturing suite. Access to cGMP manufacturing capacity gives us the ability to meet production requirements for our current clinical product candidates supporting current and future clinical trials. We also have a development services and clinical supply agreement, or the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, with Catalent to support clinical scale manufacturing for our gene therapy product candidates. 

23



We entered into a lease to support chemistry, manufacturing and controls laboratory operations for our gene therapy programs, which commenced in March 2021, in the Princeton West Innovation Campus. In 2021, we completed our build out of this new laboratory that is initially focused on state-of-the-art analytical capabilities, assay development and validation, and clinical product testing to support both viral vector manufacturing and clinical development. Since then, we have been able to internalize all major CMC laboratory capabilities, including process development, which will enable late-stage development and commercialization of our gene therapies. We have advanced our manufacturing platform which can be leveraged across our clinical and pre-clinical pipeline through standardization of our manufacturing and analytical technologies.
We believe that our manufacturing capabilities provide us with the advantages of better control of drug development timelines, improved control of vector supply for a portfolio of clinical assets and improved control of product quality through the improvements of the manufacturing platform.
We also anticipate that we will continue to make significant investments to further optimize our manufacturing capabilities and platforms to produce high-quality, cost-effective AAV vectors and we will continue to make investments in process and analytical sciences, internally or with third parties, to evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing platform processes.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the genetic medicines field, are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications as well as several companies addressing methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. We may also face competition from large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions with genetic medicine and other therapeutic approaches.
We consider our most direct competitors with respect to PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 to be Lysogene, S.A, or Lysogene, which is developing a gene therapy treatment administered via intracisternal magna for early and late infantile GM1. As of February 2022, Lysogene reported having dosed three patients and enrolled a fourth patient in the safety cohort. The National Institutes of Health is conducting a clinical trial for an IV gene therapy treatment for early and late infantile/juvenile GM1 and reported data from ten patients in October 2021. There are also preclinical enzyme replacement therapies in preclinical development. 
We consider our most direct competitors with respect to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTD-GRN to be Alector, Inc. (partnered with GlaxoSmithKline), which is enrolling a Phase 3 clinical trial with a humanized anti-human sortilin monoclonal antibody for FTD-GRN, and Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (now part of Eli Lilly & Co), which has initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment for FTD-GRN, and is expected to continue enrolling through 2023. Several other companies, including AviadoBio Ltd, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (recently acquired by Syncona Limited), and Orchard Therapeutics plc, are conducting preclinical research using gene therapy approaches to treat FTD-GRN patients. AviadoBio Ltd has reported the planned initiation of a phase 1/2 trial in 2023. Denali Therapeutics Inc. in partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited has a preclinical recombinant progranulin protein under evaluation in addition to their oral EIF2a modulator in a Phase 1 clinical trial. We are also aware of other therapeutic approaches in preclinical development that may target FTD-GRN patients.
Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, if ever. Additionally, new or advanced technologies 

24



developed by our competitors may render our current or future product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors. 
License Agreement
University of Pennsylvania
We have a research, collaboration and licensing agreement, as amended, or the Penn Agreement, with Penn, for research and development collaborations and exclusive license rights to patents for certain products and technologies. Under the Penn Agreement, we have the obligation to fund certain research relating to the preclinical development of selected products in research programs as well as the new exploratory research program in non-rare and/or non-monogenic, or large, CNS indications, initially TLE. We also fund discovery research conducted by Penn through August 2026 and will receive exclusive rights, subject to certain limitations, to technologies resulting from the discovery program for products developed with GTP, such as novel capsids, toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation improvements. Our discovery research funding commitment is $5.0 million a year for five years, with quarterly payments of $1.3 million through June 2026. Under the Penn Agreement we have eight remaining options available to us to commence additional licensed programs for CNS indications until August 2026. If we were to exercise any of these remaining options, we would owe Penn a non-refundable aggregate fee of $1.0 million, with $0.5 million per product indication paid immediately and another $0.5 million fee owed upon a further developmental milestone.
​
The Penn Agreement requires that we make payments of up to (i) $16.5 million per product candidate for rare, monogenic disorders in aggregate and (ii) $39.0 million per product candidate in the aggregate arising from the exploratory program for large CNS indications, currently TLE and such other mutually agreed upon large CNS indications. Each payment will be due upon the achievement of specific development milestone events by such licensed product for a first indication, reduced development milestone payments for the second and third indications and no development milestone payments for subsequent indications. In addition, on a product-by-product basis, we are obligated to make up to $55.0 million in sales milestone payments on each licensed product based on annual sales of the licensed product in excess of defined thresholds. 
Upon successful commercialization of a product using the licensed technology, we are obligated to pay to Penn, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties (subject to customary reductions) in the mid-single digits on annual worldwide net sales of such licensed product. In addition, we are obligated to pay to Penn a percentage of sublicensing income, ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits, for sublicenses under the Penn Agreement. The agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights that covers the exploitation of such licensed product in such country, and (ii) the expiration of the royalty period. At any time after August 2026, we may terminate the agreement in its entirety, or for a licensed product, for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Penn. Penn may terminate the agreement on an indication-by-indication basis if we fail to meet any diligence event and fail to timely cure such breach, or the agreement in its entirety if we fail to pay the research funding, fail to comply with applicable laws, grant a security interest in any of the licensed patent rights, fail to achieve certain financing obligations, or make certain challenges to the licensed patent rights. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s insolvency or material breach that is not cured within a specified period of time. In addition, we will pay Penn a tiered transaction fee ranging from 1-2% of the net proceeds upon certain change of control events.
The Penn Agreement includes an exploratory research collaboration to identify targets and early product candidates in such large CNS indications. The exploratory research program is focused on discovering targets and novel gene therapy candidates for large CNS diseases, currently focused on TLE, and that can be expanded to other large CNS diseases upon mutual agreement. The initial term of the exploratory research program is 3 years, or until August 2024, which term can be extended by mutual agreement. During such term we will have an exclusive right of first negotiation to include additional targets to the exploratory research program in the agreed upon large CNS indications. Under the exploratory research program, we will have the right to further develop and commercialize any gene therapy product candidates specific for those selected targets within TLE (and any future large CNS indications that are mutually agreed upon) that arise from the exploratory research programs on 

25



substantially the same terms of the current Penn Agreement. In November 2022, we agreed with GTP to not continue further advancement of our exploratory research program in AD.
​
Penn will notify us of any patented manufacturing methods developed by GTP during the specified research term, and we have the option to obtain a non-exclusive license under those patent rights controlled by Penn for our licensed products. 
On a CNS indication-by-indication basis, Penn has agreed that GTP will not collaborate with any commercial third party to develop another gene therapy product for the same indication during, or for one year following, its work for us on a given indication and licensed product. Under the licensed Penn patent rights, Penn retains the right to conduct (and to authorize non-commercial third parties to conduct) certain educational, research, clinical and patient care activities. 
Under the Penn Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize at least one licensed product for each of the licensed indications for prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic uses in humans. We may satisfy this obligation by achieving, for each licensed product, certain diligence events by a specified achievement date, which dates may be extended under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the agreement, Penn will be responsible for preclinical development activities, including all IND-enabling non-clinical studies and research grade manufacturing, and other collaborative activities set forth in the plan for the funded research, and we will be responsible for regulatory strategy and operations, clinical development, GMP manufacture and commercialization of all licensed products. 
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary and/or intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries for our current product candidates and future products, as well as our core technologies, including our manufacturing know-how. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining and defending our intellectual property, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through rare drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.
Currently, our patent protection consists of patent applications that we have in-licensed from Penn under the Penn Agreement for our product candidates in our licensed indications and a patent application that we filed and solely own related to a process for manufacturing our products. 
The in-licensed patent applications are directed to new AAV capsids and certain defined variants, to recombinant AAV viruses, or rAAVs, capable of delivering certain genes into human cells to treat monogenic diseases of the CNS, to methods of treating those monogenic diseases with rAAV, as well as certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and related technologies. Our in-licensed patent portfolio currently includes:

• | a patent family with applications pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions with claims directed to rAAVs having an AAVhu68 capsid. We exclusively licensed the patent family for licensed products within our rare, monogenic field of use indications. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on February 27, 2038, absent any term adjustments or extensions; ​
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two patent families with claims directed to an rAAV containing a coding sequence of human β-gal for use in treating GM1. The first patent family includes pending applications in fourteen jurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on September 30, 2039, absent any term adjustments or extensions. The second patent family includes applications pending in sixteen jurisdictions, including the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on February 1, 2041, absent any term adjustments or extensions; ​

• | two patent families with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating FTD. The first patent family includes applications pending in fifteen jurisdictions, including the US, Argentina Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on February 21, 2040, absent any term adjustments or extensions. The second patent family includes applications in Argentina and Taiwan and a pending PCT application. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on August 26, 2041; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one patent family with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating ALS. The patent family includes applications pending in Argentina and Taiwan and a pending PCT application. Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on January 10, 2043, absent any term adjustments or extensions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also have options under the Penn Agreement to add additional intellectual property to our existing license, as described in the section “License Agreement”.
The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective national filing date.
In addition to patents and patent applications that we license, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our AAV manufacturing capabilities and gene therapy technology are based upon trade secrets and know-how. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain control and/or ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how, including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of our premises and the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to our licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of the pending patent applications to which we license rights or with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our licensed patents or any patents that may be issued in the future to us or our licensors will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for certain of our product candidates generally, as well as with respect to certain indications. See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or 

27



condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of New Drug Applications, or NDAs. Biological products, such as gene therapy products, are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to file NDA/BLAs and to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including Good Laboratory Practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to subjects, including healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions if it believes that the subjects are subject to unacceptable risk.
Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the biologic into subjects, the product is tested to assess safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with drug exposure, and to obtain early evidence of a treatment effect if possible. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, determine optimal dose and regimen, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, generally Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical effects and confirm efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic. 

28



In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. Under an approved BLA, the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees typically increase annually. A BLA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee, unless the BLA includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agency’s determination that it is adequately organized and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing; applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing. A BLA can be classified for Priority Review when the FDA determines the biologic product has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the BLA submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products, or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to be reviewed by an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the BLA should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure, potent and effective in the claimed indication.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and completes any clinical and manufacturing site inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure a product’s safe use, or ETASU. An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA 

29



supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
Additional Standard for Gene Therapy Products
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. For instance, FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies that are based on adeno-associated virus vectors in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum 5-year period. FDA does not require the long-term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan disease use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product in the approved indication. For large molecule drugs, including gene therapies, sameness is determined based on the principal molecular structural features of a product. As applied to gene therapies, the FDA has recently issued final guidance in which it stated it generally intends to consider certain key features, such as the transgenes expressed by the gene therapy and the vectors used to deliver the transgene, to be principal molecular structural features. With regard to vectors, the FDA generally intends to consider whether two vectors from the same viral class are the same or different on a case-by-case basis. The FDA does not intend to consider minor differences between transgenes and vectors to be different principal molecular structural features. When two gene therapy products express the same transgene and have or use the same vector, determining whether two gene therapies are the same drug may also depend on additional features of the final gene therapy product, such as regulatory elements and the cell type that is transduced (for genetically modified cells). In such cases, the FDA generally intends to determine whether two gene therapy products are different on a case-by-case basis. During the seven-year marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same principal molecular structural features for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product can be considered clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition, or the same biological product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application. A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or BLA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA or BLA must be deemed 

30



eligible for priority review; the NDA or BLA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by the FDA; and the NDA or BLA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease.
To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of the NDA or BLA, of its intent to request a voucher. If the FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA or BLA is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA or BLA a voucher upon approval of the NDA or BLA. The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval. The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or BLA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify the FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee. The FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA.
On December 27, 2020, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to September 30, 2024 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to September 30, 2026. It is unclear whether this program will continue to be reauthorized beyond the current sunset date in September 2024.
Fast Track Designation and Priority Review
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track Designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track Designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review.
Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product with 

31



orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Biosimilars
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a previously approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. The first biosimilar product was approved by the FDA in 2015, and the first interchangeable product was approved in 2021.
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure, or BLA approval, of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and 

32



promotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports are required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, biotechnology company activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. The laws biotechnology companies may have to comply with include the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti- Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and/or formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. In addition, the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors are subject to change.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the 

33



federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses and purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations, and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Commercial distribution of products requires compliance with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. In addition, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to 

34



establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. Certain local jurisdictions also require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Sales and marketing activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations may result in penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to enter into government contracts, oversight monitoring, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which regulatory approval is received for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Expensive pharmaco-economic studies may need to be conducted in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable the maintenance of price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which regulatory approval is received for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and is expected to continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which regulatory approval is received, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 ​

Healthcare Reform
Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices. Healthcare reform proposals recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which will eliminate, beginning in 2025, the coverage gap under Medicare Part D by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA will also allow HHS to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D (excluding drugs and biologics that are designated and approved for only one rare disease or condition), although only high-expenditure single-source biologics that have been approved for at least 11 years (7 years for drugs) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in October 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 2023 for Medicare Part B, the IRA will also penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part D and Part B drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. It is unclear to what extent other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented in the future.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
​
We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all of our employees can thrive in an environment that values differences, provides equal opportunities and embraces different backgrounds and perspectives. We treat all individuals with respect and dignity and provide all of our employees with fair treatment based on merit. By embracing diversity and inclusion, we create an organization committed to working together to develop innovative solutions in support of our mission. Our core values include a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we have embraced them as integral parts of our business strategy.
​
Our Compensation and Benefits
​
We view our employees as one of our most valuable assets in serving our mission. We compete in the highly competitive biotechnology industry, and attracting, retaining and developing a diverse group of talented employees is crucial to our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. We are committed to the development and retention of our workforce to support our research, clinical operations, manufacturing and regulatory efforts. There currently is a shortage of skilled individuals with substantial experience discovering, developing and manufacturing genetic medicines, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for these individuals is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We face substantial competition among numerous companies and academic institutions for individuals with these skills.
​
Given the highly competitive nature of our industry and the importance of recruitment and retention to our success, we strive to provide our employees with what we believe is a very competitive and comprehensive total rewards package of compensation, benefits and services. This package includes at or above-market pay, healthcare benefits for employees and family members, life insurance benefits, short and long-term disability benefits, generous paid time off benefits, parental leave, bereavement leave, flexible work schedules, a 5% employer match of employee contributions to our sponsored retirement plans, and an annual stipend for employees to spend on professional development. Additionally, we also offer every full-time employee the benefit of equity ownership in our Company through our equity plans.
​
Facilities
Our principal executive office is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where we lease a total of approximately 37,000 square feet of office space, which commenced in February 2021 and will expire in December 2031, subject to our option to extend the term of the lease by up to two additional five-year terms.
We also lease approximately 62,000 square feet of laboratory space at the Princeton West Innovation Campus in Hopewell, New Jersey. This lease has a 15-year term from the lease commencement date of March 2021. We have the option to extend the term of the lease by up to two additional five-year terms.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational harm, and other factors.
