Item 1.    Business.
Overview
The Company operates a network of e-commerce marketplaces that enable buyers and sellers to transact in an efficient, automated environment offering over 500 product categories. The Company’s marketplaces provide professional buyers access to a global, organized supply of new, surplus, and scrap assets presented with digital images and other relevant product information. Additionally, the Company enables its corporate and government sellers to enhance their financial return on offered assets by providing a liquid marketplace and value-added services that encompass the consultative management, valuation, and sale of surplus assets. The Company's services include program management, valuation, asset management, reconciliation, refurbishment and recycling, fulfillment, marketing and sales, warehousing and transportation, buyer support, compliance and risk mitigation, as well as self-directed service tools for its sellers. The Company organizes the products on its marketplaces into categories across major industry verticals such as consumer electronics, general merchandise, apparel, scientific equipment, aerospace parts and equipment, technology hardware, energy equipment, industrial capital assets, fleet and transportation equipment and specialty equipment. The Company’s marketplaces are: www.liquidation.com, www.govdeals.com, www.networkintl.com, www.secondipity.com, and www.go-dove.com. We also operate a global search engine for used machinery and equipment at www.machinio.com. The Company has over 13,000 sellers, including Fortune 1000 and Global 500 organizations as well as federal, state, and local government agencies. 
During November 2019, we also launched our new aggregated marketplace. This site is in early beta phase and we will deploy capabilities and integrate more product categories incrementally throughout FY2020. This approach allows us flexibility to prioritize functionality based on customer feedback.
We believe our ability to create liquid marketplaces for surplus and scrap assets generates a continuous flow of goods from our sellers. This valuable and reliable flow of goods, in turn, attracts an increasing number of professional buyers to our marketplaces. Increasing numbers of professional buyers to our marketplaces, in turn, attracts more sellers to our marketplace which, in turn, reinforces a valuable and reliable flow of surplus assets. During the past three fiscal years, we have conducted over 1,750,000 online transactions generating $1.9 billion in gross merchandise volume or GMV. GMV is the total sales value of all merchandise sold by us or our sellers through our marketplaces or by us through other channels during a given period of time.
During 2019, the number of registered buyers grew from 3,357,000 to 3,580,000, or 6.6%. We believe the continuous flow of goods in our marketplaces attracts a growing buyer base which creates a self-sustaining cycle for our buyers and sellers.
During the year ended September 30, 2019, we generated GMV of $639.9 million and revenue of $226.5 million through multiple sources, including transaction fees from sellers and buyers, proceeds from the sale of products we purchased from sellers, and value-added service charges. Our GMV has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10.6% since 2006. 
On July 10, 2018, we acquired 100% of Machinio Corp. (“Machinio”), a privately-owned company based in Chicago, Illinois, with a second office in Berlin, Germany. Machinio operates a global online platform for listing used equipment for sale in the construction, machine tool, transportation, printing and agriculture sectors. See Note 4 for further information on this acquisition.
We were incorporated in Delaware in November 1999 as Liquidation.com, Inc. and commenced operations in early 2000.
Results from our operations are organized into four reportable segments, Retail Supply Chain Group (RSCG), Capital Assets Group (CAG), GovDeals, and Machinio. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Segment Information.
Industry Overview
While a well-established forward supply chain exists for the procurement of assets, many manufacturers, retailers, corporations and government agencies have not made significant investments in their reverse supply chain process or systems. For example, research from Brightpearl (2018) has found that more than half of all retailers (51%) claim their margins are being squeezed by returns, yet 69% are not deploying any technology solutions to help process them. The reverse supply chain addresses the redeployment and remarketing of surplus and salvage assets. These assets generally consist of retail customer returns, overstock products and end-of-life goods or capital assets from both the corporate and government sectors. The market is large, as indicated by an Appriss Retail report in 2018 that shows $369 billion, or 10% of total sales, of merchandise is returned on an annual basis. Estimates based on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Census, and World Bank reports, the global used equipment market is valued at approximately $350 billion.
The supply of surplus and salvage assets in the reverse supply chain results from a number of factors, including:
•Supply chain inefficiencies.  Forecasting inaccuracies, manufacturer overruns, canceled orders, evolving market preferences, discontinued product lines, merchandise packaging changes and seasonal fluctuations result in the growth of surplus assets. Organizations that manufacture, distribute, sell or use finished goods regularly dispose of excess inventory or returned merchandise.
•Product innovation.  Continuous innovation in technology products, such as computer and office equipment, consumer electronics, and personal communication and entertainment devices, results in a continuous flow of surplus assets. Innovation also results in manufacturing equipment and tooling being upgraded and replaced which generates a separate flow of surplus capital assets.
•Return policies of large national and online retailers.  The flexible return practices of many large national retailers and online shopping sites result in a continuous supply of returned merchandise, a significant portion of which must be liquidated.
•Compliance with government regulations.  An increasingly stringent regulatory environment necessitates the verifiable recycling and remarketing of surplus assets that would otherwise be disposed of as waste.
•Increasing focus by corporate and government agencies to seek green solutions for surplus assets.  Many organizations appreciate the growing need to be environmentally friendly by improving their management of end of life or surplus goods, including the need to repurpose or efficiently redistribute surplus and capital assets to minimize waste and maximize value for themselves and the communities they serve.
•Changing budgetary trends in corporate and governmental entities.  As corporate and governmental entities increasingly are being pressured to enhance efficiencies, while utilizing less resources, they are looking to the liquidation of surplus and salvage capital assets as a source of funds.
The management and remarketing of surplus assets traditionally has been an inefficient process. While many organizations spend considerable resources developing systems and channels supporting the flow of finished goods to their core customers and developing procurement processes for acquiring equipment and assets to support their operations, we believe that many have not historically dedicated significant resources to the reverse supply chain. Factors contributing to these inefficiencies in the reverse supply chain include the lack of:
•a centralized and global marketplace to sell bulk products as well as machinery and equipment in the reverse supply chain;
•awareness of effective methods and mechanisms for disposal of surplus assets;
•experience in managing the reverse supply chain to seek optimal net returns and improve gross margins; and
•real time market data on surplus assets.
Traditional methods of surplus and salvage asset disposition include ad-hoc, negotiated direct sales, utilization of individual brokers or sales agents and live on-site auctions. We believe these solutions are generally highly fragmented, geographically dispersed and poorly integrated with supply chain operations. The manual, negotiated and geographically dispersed nature of traditional surplus resale methods results in a lack of pricing transparency for offered goods, multiple brokers/parties ultimately involved in the final disposition and a lower number of potential buyers and bids, which we believe typically leads to lower recovery for sellers.
A significant number of professional buyers seek surplus and salvage assets to sustain their operations and meet demands of end-customers. They include online and offline retailers, convenience and discount stores, value-added resellers such as refurbishers and scrap recyclers, import and export firms, and small businesses. Traditionally, these buyers have had limited access to a reliable flow of surplus goods and assets, relying instead on their own network of industry contacts and fixed-site auctioneers to locate, evaluate and purchase specific items of interest. Traditional methods are inefficient for buyers due to the lack of:
•global access to an available continuous supply of desired goods and assets;
•efficient and inexpensive sourcing processes;
•a professionally managed central marketplace with transparent, high quality services;
•detailed information and product description for the offered goods; and
•pricing transparency or ability to compare asset prices.
The Internet is a global medium enabling millions of people worldwide to share information, communicate and conduct business electronically. Strong growth has occurred in the business-to-business (B2B) online retail market, which can be attributed to the rapid migration of manufacturers and wholesalers to open, online platforms. Forrester Research (2018) forecasts that US B2B eCommerce will reach $1.8 trillion and account for 17% of all B2B sales in the US by 2023. At the end of 2018, Forrester expected eCommerce to have reached $1.1 trillion and represent 12% of total B2B sales in the US. They also forecast a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% for B2B eCommerce over the next five years. We believe professional 
buyers of surplus and salvage assets will increasingly use these B2B platforms to identify and source goods available for immediate online purchase.
Our Solution
Our solution comprises e-commerce marketplaces, self-directed auction listing tools, and value-added services. Our marketplaces and services provide sellers a comprehensive solution to quickly bring surplus assets to market and enhance the financial value realized from the sale of their surplus assets while providing buyers with confidence in the reliable flow of goods they purchase. We provide our sellers access to a network of liquid marketplaces with over 3.58 million professional buyers and a suite of services including consultative surplus asset management, valuation, sales solutions, logistics capabilities, and self-directed service tools to efficiently manage our sellers' reverse supply chain and maximize total supply chain value. We also seek the optimal methods to maximize our sellers' net recovery using channel strategies and dedicated programs to deliver transparent, sustained value.
Through our relationships with our sellers, we provide our buyers convenient access to a substantial and continuous flow of surplus and salvage assets. Buyers can find products in over 500 categories in lot sizes ranging from full truck loads to pallets, packages and individual items. Our solution combines leading e-commerce marketplaces with integrated sales, marketing, merchandising, fulfillment, payment collection, customer support, dispute mediation and logistics services. We provide our buyers a convenient method for sourcing surplus consumer goods and commercial capital assets, including industrial equipment, energy equipment, and biopharma assets. We also are continually looking for new categories in which we can expand our presence, including mobile devices and construction and heavy equipment. For any given asset, our buyers have access to a detailed product description, product manifest, digital images, relevant transaction history regarding the seller, shipping weights, product dimensions and estimated shipping costs to the buyer's location. This enables our solutions to become an important source for surplus and salvage assets for many of our professional buyers and end-users.
We believe our marketplaces benefit over time from greater scale and adoption by our constituents creating a continuous flow of goods benefiting our buyers and sellers. As of September 30, 2019, we had 3,580,000 registered buyers in our marketplaces and access to millions of end-users through a range of existing consumer marketplaces. Aggregating this level of buyer demand and market data enables us to generate a continuous flow of goods from corporate and government sellers, which in turn attracts an increasing number of professional buyers. During the year ended September 30, 2019 we had over 2,085,000 auction participants in our online auctions. During 2019, we grew our registered buyer base by 6.6% or 223,000. None of our buyers represented more than 10% of our revenue during the year ended September 30, 2019. As buyers continue to discover and use our e-commerce marketplaces as an effective method to source assets, we believe our solutions become an increasingly attractive sales channel for corporate and government agency sellers. We believe this self-reinforcing cycle results in greater transaction volume and enhances the value of our marketplaces.
Our marketplaces serve clients in a large variety of industry verticals, including:
Competitive Factors
We have created liquid marketplaces for virtually any type, quantity or condition of surplus or salvage assets. The strengths of our business model include:
Aggregation of supply and demand for surplus and salvage assets
The strength of our business model rests on our ability to aggregate sellers and buyers through our marketplaces. Sellers benefit from a liquid, transparent market and the active participation of our large base of professional buyers, which enhances their returns in comparison to less efficient models. Buyers benefit from our relationships with high-volume, corporate and government sellers, which provides them with continuous access to a comprehensive selection of surplus and salvage assets. Our solution eliminates the need for sellers and buyers to rely on the highly fragmented and geographically dispersed group of traditional liquidators. Instead, sellers and buyers access our global e-commerce marketplaces for their entire surplus and salvage asset needs.
Integrated and comprehensive solution
Our marketplaces provide sellers and buyers with a comprehensive solution for the online sale and purchase of surplus and salvage assets. We offer marketplaces with full-service solutions such as Liquidation.com, GoIndustry DoveBid, and Network International and we offer self-directed service solutions on our GovDeals marketplace, Network International, Liquidiation.com, and our newly launched aggregated marketplace that provides transaction settlement and marketing support while allowing sellers to save on their commissions by undertaking the work of photographing, cataloging, and building auctions. 
We also have a full suite of value-added services to simplify the sales and supply chain processes for our sellers and improve the utility of our marketplaces for our buyers. For corporate and certain government sellers, we provide sales, marketing, logistics and seller support services that are fully integrated with our marketplaces, creating operational and system efficiencies. For many of these sellers, asset disposition is not a core business function to which they desire to dedicate internal resources. With our solution, we manage each step of the transaction and reverse supply chain for our sellers, reducing complexity while providing the ability to optimize the seller's net financial return in the sale of surplus goods and assets. Sellers simply make goods available at their facilities or deliver them to our distribution centers and we deliver the sale proceeds (less our portion of such proceeds and/or our commissions or fees) after the sale is completed. In response to sellers feedback, we have learned that our sellers would like bespoke returns process management or return to vendor solutions tailored to their own systems, and accordingly, we shifted focus from developing SaaS solutions to refining our own internal returns management processes that we use to serve our sellers. 
We have also expanded our efforts to further penetrate the mobile device category. According to Counterpoint, the Global refurbished smartphone market is growing faster than the new smartphone market and is expected to grow to 140 million devices in 2019. 
Our buyer services include intelligent alerts, search tools, dynamic pricing, shipping and delivery, secure settlement, live buyer support and dispute resolution to enable effective methods to source assets for their businesses.
Flexible and aligned transaction model
We offer two primary transaction models to our sellers: the purchase transaction model and the consignment transaction model. Under the purchase transaction model, we purchase inventory from a seller that we resell in our marketplaces. Sometimes our inventory purchase price is variable, as we may share the gross or net proceeds of such resales with the seller. Sellers that elect the purchase transaction model are considered vendors. Under the consignment transaction model, we do not purchase inventory from a seller; instead, we enable a seller to sell its goods in our marketplaces and we earn commission revenue based on the proceeds received from the sale. Sellers that elect the consignment transaction model are considered consignors.
Faster transaction cycle times for our sellers and buyers
We believe our marketplace solutions allow our sellers to complete the entire sales process more rapidly than through other liquidation methods by generally reducing the complexities in the reverse supply chain and utilizing our multi-channel strategies to optimize recovery and velocity. As a result, our sellers can reduce surplus or less valuable inventory quickly, generate additional working capital and reduce the cost of carrying unwanted assets. We provide a one stop solution to enable professional buyers of any size throughout the world to purchase assets efficiently. For these buyers, we provide a broad range of services to give them the information necessary to make an informed bid and ensure they quickly and efficiently receive the goods purchased.
Solutions that promote sustainability and green solutions for improved corporate/government stewardship
Our solutions provide a range of capabilities that enable corporate and government agency sellers to directly reduce waste generated by redistributing end-of-life products or assets, through our solutions, thereby improving the net financial recovery generated while positively impacting the communities they serve. Some of the world's largest forward-thinking corporations and government agencies have significantly enhanced their stewardship of communities and the environment by utilizing our services and selling their surplus assets through our marketplaces.
Our Strategy
The focus of our growth strategy is to build the world’s leading marketplace for surplus assets to benefit buyers, sellers, and the planet. Our strategic plan rests on four pillars, that we refer to by the acronym RISE, which pillars are as follows: (1) Recovery maximization; (2) Increase volume; (3) Service Expansion; and (4) Expense Leverage. 
Recovery Maximization
Based on feedback from our sellers, we believe recovery maximization is the single most important driver to attracting sellers to our marketplaces. We believe that the key to achieving higher net recovery is, in turn, driven by attracting buyers to our marketplace which we believe that we can do through technology and innovation that improves the buyer experience across our network of marketplaces. An improved buyer experience should drive growth in our buyer base which will, in turn, improve recovery rates for our sellers. Our new e-commerce technology platform includes: 
•a new global taxonomy to classify and present assets for sale consistently across our businesses; 
•a new mobile responsive design with enhanced usability and speed; 
•improved search and navigation by industry vertical, location and other parameters; 
•a new My Account tool to manage transaction activity; and 
•multilingual and multi-currency capabilities to support cross-border commerce.
Most recently, we launched our new aggregated marketplace. While in beta testing today, we expect that this marketplace will aggregate over time all of our supply surplus in a single destination for buyers to find and bid on our entire inventory of assets. We are investing in enhanced asset promotion and marketing to our existing and target buyer base that will leverage a data-driven recommendation engine to promote relevant assets to buyers based on stated or implied preferences. Lastly, we plan to increase buyer participation by enhancing our mobile experience through new mobile apps for buyers to find and buy assets on any device.
Increase Volume
We intend to grow the volume of transacted surplus on our marketplaces with flexible service offerings and pricing models to meet the needs of existing and new sellers. We have expanded our self-directed service model to allow commercial sellers that do not require a full-service solution to leverage the power of our marketing and online marketplaces to drive buyer demand for their assets. This approach allows us to more completely penetrate the total addressable market by better meeting the needs of 
small and mid-sized organizations, equipment dealers, and organizations with lower volume needs. We also anticipate increasing volume by placing a greater focus on certain categories, including construction and heavy equipment. We also intend to grow our volume within the retail supply chain by leveraging the self-directed service model and expanding our mobile device category. We will continue to provide flexible pricing models that allow our sellers to use either a consignment or a principal-based model. 
Service Expansion
We intend to grow our services with recurring revenue characteristics that leverage our technology platform, domain expertise, data, and marketplace channels. By leveraging our extensive knowledge and technology, we intend to grow our revenue by attracting more sellers and more volume through expanding our services to better support sellers and buyers in the construction and heavy equipment and mobile device categories, expanding and improving our asset management and redeployment tools for commercial and municipal government sellers on our new aggregated marketplace. Lastly, our recent acquisition of Machinio expands our capabilities with respect to technology-enabled advertising and is a natural adjunct to our self-service and full-service solutions available in our marketplaces.
Expense Leverage
We intend to improve operating expense leverage by controlling costs and through technology and innovation that increases productivity. We intend to simplify and streamline operations and, where appropriate, consolidate business processes and systems which will reduce our fixed costs and improve scalability. We have developed and will leverage a unified marketing organization to improve our buyer marketing productivity and drive increased volumes of highly targeted buyers to our marketplaces. 
Future State
In sum, we intend to deliver a more diversified, asset light business with recurring revenue that focuses on profitability while growing a solid foundation for long-term growth. As we re-establish organic growth in GMV and revenues, grow our asset light technology enabled services, and build more recurring revenue, we believe our long-term value and ability to serve our sellers and buyers will grow.
Our Marketplaces
Our e-commerce marketplaces are efficient and convenient methods for the sale of surplus and salvage consumer goods and capital assets. They are designed to address the particular requirements and needs of buyers and sellers. We operate and enable several marketplaces, including the following:
•Our www.liquidation.com marketplace enables corporations located in the United States to sell surplus and salvage consumer goods and retail capital assets. This leading B2B marketplace and our related value-added services are designed to meet the needs of our sellers by selling their surplus assets to domestic and international buyers.
•Our www.govdeals.com marketplace provides self-directed service solutions in which sellers list their own assets, and enables local and state government entities including city, county and state agencies, located in the United States and Canada to sell surplus and salvage assets. GovDeals also offers a suite of self-directed solutions that include transaction settlement and buyer marketing.
•Our www.networkintl.com marketplace enables corporations to sell idle, surplus, and scrap equipment in the oil and gas, petrochemical and power generation industries. This marketplace and our related services are designed to meet the unique needs of energy sector sellers.
•Our www.go-dove.com marketplace enables corporations located in the United States, Europe, and Asia to sell manufacturing surplus, salvage capital assets, and scrap material. This marketplace and our related services are designed to meet the specific needs of manufacturing sector sellers selling their surplus assets to domestic and international buyers.
•Our new aggregated marketplace leverages our 20 years of experience in the online surplus industry to create a centralized marketplace that connects our entire global buyer base with assets from across our network of legacy marketplaces in a single destination. This marketplace will continually evolve as we enhance our marketplace platform technology and add new seller and buyer services.
Besides these leading business-to-business marketplaces, we recognize the need to reach end users for some assets our sellers have entrusted to us. We have developed the capability to sell products on our sellers' behalf directly to end-users and/or consumers using a range of existing marketplaces. Our www.secondipity.com marketplace provides consumers a trusted source of value products through a socially conscious online experience designed to provide "Better Value, Better Life," by donating a portion of the proceeds of every sale to charity. We also have an established global buyer base that seeks to buy in larger quantities than are offered through our standard auction platform. We have dedicated sales teams to support their needs and 
supply chain. These range from a single truckload to ongoing flows of goods for export anywhere in the world, where we market, handle, and support the full transaction on behalf of our buyers. We expect to continue to meet the needs of our sellers and to access a growing range of products for all our buyers by enhancing our multi-channel strategy to ensure we create the greatest value for assets at the end of their initial product life cycle.
On July 10, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Machinio, a privately-owned company based in Chicago, Illinois. Machinio operates a global online platform for listing used equipment for sale in the construction, machine tool, transportation, printing and agriculture sectors. This search engine can be found at www.machinio.com.
Our Value-Added Services for Buyers and Sellers
In addition to our self-directed tools for our sellers, we have integrated value-added services to simplify the reverse supply chain processes for both our sellers and buyers. We believe these services create the greatest operational efficiencies within this element of the supply chain enabling the greatest value for sellers and buyers with the highest level of confidence and transparency in the services we provide. Additionally, we believe these services improve compliance with the policies, regulations and sale restrictions of our corporate and government sellers while supporting, or greatly enhancing, many corporate or government environmental initiatives.
Seller services.    We offer value-added services to sellers in three areas: (1) merchandising and channel optimization, (2) logistics and (3) settlement and seller support, including compliance services.
•Merchandising and Channel Optimization. Our efforts encompass the services necessary to prepare merchandise for a successful auction and include the following:
◦Channel Optimization—we determine the marketplace and channel sales strategy that we believe will create the most value for the individual asset using our real-time transaction systems and proprietary data to support ongoing optimization.
◦Marketing and promotion—we use a variety of both online and traditional marketing methods to promote our sellers' merchandise and generate the interest in each asset.
◦Asset lotting and merchandising—we leverage our industry experience to organize the merchandise we receive into size and product combinations that meet buyer preferences within each marketplace and channel.
◦Product information enhancement—we provide digital images of the merchandise to be sold and combine the images with relevant information. To increase the realized sales value, we also research, collect and use supplemental product information to enhance product descriptions.
•Logistics.  We provide logistics services designed to support the receipt, handling, transportation and tracking of merchandise offered through our marketplaces, including the following:
◦Distribution centers—we provide sellers with the flexibility of either having us manage the sales process at their location or delivering merchandise to one of our distribution centers.
◦Inventory management—sellers benefit from our management and inventory tracking system designed so merchandise is received, processed and delivered promptly.
◦Cataloguing merchandise—we catalogue all merchandise, which enables us to provide useful product information to buyers and sellers. In certain circumstances, we inspect the merchandise and provide condition descriptions to improve quality and the financial recovery to the seller.
◦Testing, data wiping, de-labeling and refurbishment—we test products, wipe electronic data, refurbish and remove labels and product markings from merchandise prior to sale in order to add value to the asset and protect sellers' brand equity and distribution relationships.
◦Return to vendor or product disposition to non-sales channels—we manage the end-to-end processes for our sellers ensuring that returned merchandise is disposed of in compliance with a variety of disposition requirements. We provide end-to-end management of returning products to vendors, charities, or channels outside of our leading marketplace solutions.
◦Outbound fulfillment—we can arrange for domestic or international shipping for all merchandise, whether it is a small item or container load for export located in one of our distribution centers or at a seller's facility.
◦Settlement and seller support.  Settlement and seller support services are designed for successful and reliable completion of transactions and include:
▪Buyer qualification—we qualify buyers to ensure their compliance with government or seller mandated terms of sale, as well as to confirm their ability to complete a transaction.
▪Collection and settlement—we collect payments on behalf of sellers prior to delivery of any merchandise and disburse the proceeds to the seller after the satisfaction of all conditions of a sale.
▪Transaction tracking and reporting—we enable sellers and buyers to track and monitor the status of their transactions throughout the sales process. We support the successful completion of each transaction on behalf of the buyer and seller. We provide a range of comprehensive reporting services to sellers upon the completion of a transaction. Our invoicing and reporting tools can be integrated with the seller's information system, providing a more efficient flow of data.
•Seller support and dispute resolution. We provide full support throughout the transaction process and dispute resolution for our buyers and sellers if needed.
Buyer services.    Many of the services we provide to sellers also benefit buyers by providing them with the information to make a more informed bid and by delivering the goods they purchased. Our buyer-focused services include:
•Intelligent alerts and recommendations—we notify buyers of upcoming auctions based on their registered preferences and prior transaction history. Registered preferences can be as broad as a product category or as specific as a part number or key word. We use this information to ensure informed recommendations whenever we identify a product that fits a buyer's preference. We will alert our buyers based on their preferences when auctions are initially launched or nearing conclusion and based on various other parameters to enable our buyers to see relevant products.
•Search and navigation tools—buyers can search our marketplaces for products based on a variety of criteria and personalized settings, including product category, keyword, lot size, product condition, product geographic location and auction ending date.
•Dynamic pricing tools, product information, and shipping quotes—we offer multiple dynamic pricing tools including outbid notification, automated bid agent and automatic auction extension. In addition, we provide buyers the information they need to make informed decisions, including product data, seller performance, and online shipping quotes to help understand their landed cost.
•Broad and flexible range of shipping/pick-up options—we can provide packaging and shipping services for each transaction, whether it is a small item or container loads for export, including buyer pick-up at our premises, for the majority of transactions, or support buyer arranged transportation. 
•Secure settlement and buyer support—besides qualifying sellers, providing several electronic payment options and serving as a trusted market intermediary, we verify transaction completion, which enhances buyer confidence. In addition, we provide full reliable buyer support throughout the transaction process.
Sales and Marketing
We utilize a direct sales and marketing force to acquire and manage our seller and buyer accounts. Our sales activities are focused on acquiring new sellers and expanding existing sellers' use of our solutions. Our marketing activities are focused on acquiring and activating new buyers and increasing existing buyers' participation. Our marketing team also manages our marketplace brands and drives seller lead generation efforts that support the sales team.
Sales
Our sales personnel develop seller relationships, contract to provide our services and manage the business accounts on an on-going basis. Our sales team focuses on building long-term relationships with sellers that we believe will generate recurring transactions. They also leverage our years of experience and market data of completed transactions to identify which of our various services would be beneficial to each new or existing seller. Our sales team works with several auction partners globally for both purchase and consignment transaction model projects. In addition, we have a lead generation team which tracks announcements regarding plant closures around the world. The lead generation team uses several sources to research plant closures, which sources include news aggregators, trade journals, industry specific web sites and bankruptcy reports on a global basis.
We organize our sellers group into two distinct groups: large full-service sellers, and self-directed sellers. We base our approach on our experience in understanding and serving the unique needs of each type of seller:
•Large full-service sellers.  These sellers require a customized approach, using a combination of our industry-focused sales team and our value-added services to create a comprehensive solution tailored to their needs.
•Self-directed sellers.  These sellers are offered a turn-key solution enabling them to self-direct the sale of their assets on our marketplaces by accessing tools and resources to optimize their net recovery.
Our sales personnel receive salary and performance-based commissions.
Marketing
We use a variety of online and traditional marketing strategies to attract and activate professional buyers to maximize the number of bidders participating in our e-commerce marketplaces as well as to support our sales team:
•Buyer acquisition.  We utilize marketing automation and digital online marketing, including paid search advertising, search engine optimization, affiliate programs and cross promotion to acquire new buyers. We supplement this online marketing with special event print media, classified advertisements and selected direct mail campaigns. Public relations campaigns, participation in trade shows and speaking engagements also complement our overall buyer acquisition efforts.
•Buyer participation.  We use many tools to increase buyer participation, including: targeted opt-in e-mail newsletters that provide content based on the buyer's stated categories of interest and past bidding or transaction activity; special e-mail alerts highlighting specific products of interest; personalized recommendation engines; and convenient search tools that enable a buyer or prospective buyer to find desired items on our e-commerce marketplaces.
•Market research.  In order to better target buyers by industry segment, geographic location or other criteria, our marketing department continually gathers data and information from each of the buyer segments we serve. In addition, the marketing department conducts regular surveys to better understand buyers' behavior and needs. We have adopted a privacy policy and have implemented security measures to protect this information.
•Sales support.  Our marketing department employs a robust lead generation program, creates documentation and research to support our sales team in presenting our company to potential sellers and buyers, including sales brochures and white papers, and participation in selected trade shows.
All marketing activities are evaluated based on the level of auction participation in our marketplaces, the cost to acquire new sellers, and the cost effectiveness of each action.
Technology and IT Infrastructure
Our marketplaces are web-based and can be accessed from any Internet-enabled device by using a standard web browser. Our technology systems enable us to automate and streamline many of the manual processes associated with finding, evaluating, bidding on, paying for and shipping surplus and salvage assets. The technology and content behind our marketplaces and integrated value-added services were developed by us, providing us with control over the marketplaces and the ability to make enhancements quickly to better fit the specific needs of our buyers and sellers. Our infrastructure provides: 
•an efficient channel to sell online through a variety of pricing mechanisms (standard auction, sealed bid, make an offer, and fixed price);
•a scalable back office that enables buyers and sellers to efficiently manage transactions among remote business users by utilizing account management tools, including payment collection, invoicing management, shipping and transaction settlement; and
•an input/output agnostic platform, including Application Programming Interface or other conduits that enable us to integrate seamlessly with partner enterprise applications of sellers and third party service providers.
We have designed our websites and supporting infrastructure to be robust and to support new services and increased traffic. Our servers are fully-managed and hosted by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure Public Cloud Platforms. Every critical piece of our application is regionally resilient, and we maintain off-site back-up systems and we can provision a disaster recovery facility. Our network connectivity offers high performance and scalability to accommodate increases in website traffic. Since January 1, 2003, we have experienced no material service interruptions on our e-commerce marketplaces.
Our applications support multiple layers of security, including password-protected log-ins, encryption technology to safeguard information transmitted in web sessions and firewalls to help prevent unauthorized access to our network and servers. We devote significant resources to protecting our systems from intrusion.
Further, we devote resources to continuous improvement of our technology and IT infrastructure. In 2019, we completed our new e-commerce technology platform that includes:
•a new global taxonomy to classify and present assets for sale consistently across our businesses; 
•a new mobile responsive design with enhanced usability and speed; 
•improved search and navigation by industry vertical, location and other parameters; 
•a new My Account tool to manage transaction activity; and 
•multilingual and multi-currency capabilities to support cross-border commerce.
Operations
Supporting large organizations that have a recurring need to sell surplus and salvage assets requires systematic processes to enhance the financial value and convenience received by our sellers. We believe we have integrated the required operational processes into our solution to efficiently and to effectively support our buyers and sellers. Our operations group comprises three functions: (1) buyer relations, (2) shipping logistics and (3) distribution center and field service operations.
Buyer relations
Our buyer relations group supports the completion of buyer transactions by managing the buyer registration and qualification process, answering questions and requests from buyers, collecting buyer payments and resolving disputes. Our websites contain extensive information about buying through our e-commerce marketplaces, including an online tutorial regarding the use of our marketplaces, answers to frequently-asked buyer questions and an indexed help section. Buyers can contact a buyer support service representative by live chat and e-mail or phone if they need additional support.
Shipping logistics
Our shipping logistics group manages and coordinates inbound and outbound shipping of merchandise for sellers and buyers. We offer, as part of our value-added services, integrated shipping services using our own fleet or multiple vetted and pre-qualified carrier partners. In addition, our shipping coordinators monitor the performance and service level of our network of carriers to help ensure speed and quality of service.
Distribution center and field service operations
Our distribution center and field service operations group performs selected pre-sale and post-sale value-added services at our distribution centers and at seller locations globally. These activities include unloading, manifesting and reporting discrepancies for all received assets and sales preparation of offered assets, including merchandising and organizing offered assets, writing product descriptions, capturing digital images and/or video and providing additional optional value-added services such as returns management (RM) services, return to vendor (RTV) services and product delabelling, data cleaning/wiping, testing, refurbishment and repackaging. Our distribution center and field service operations group personnel also arranges the outbound shipping or pick-up of purchased assets for our buyers.
Competition
The online services market for auctioning or liquidating surplus and salvage assets is competitive and growing rapidly. We compete with:
•other e-commerce platforms;
•auction, reverse auction, and direct sale websites;
•government agencies that have created websites to sell surplus and salvage assets; and
•traditional liquidators and fixed-site auctioneers.
In our marketplaces for surplus and salvage assets, we compete with a variety of online, mobile, and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, e-commerce providers, auction websites, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, and government agencies that have created websites to sell surplus. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new categories of surplus and salvage items, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile, and offline channels.
Our markets may become even more competitive as traditional and online liquidators and auctioneers continue to develop online and offline services for disposition, redeployment and remarketing of surplus and salvage assets. In addition, manufacturers, retailers and government agencies may create their own websites to sell their own surplus and salvage assets and those of third parties.
Competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.
Our Vendor Contracts with Amazon.com, Inc. and the United States Department of Defense
Our RSCG segment has multiple vendor contracts with Amazon.com, Inc., under which we acquire commercial merchandise to sell under the purchase model. The commercial merchandise we purchased under this contract represented 43.6%, 33.7% and 21.8% of consolidated cost of goods sold for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
DoD agreements.  Historically, we had two material vendor contracts with the DoD, the Scrap Contract and the Surplus Contract. Both contracts are included in the results of our CAG segment.
•Scrap Contract.  Under the Scrap Contract, which concluded on September 30, 2019, we acquired, managed and sold all non-electronic scrap property of the DoD turned into the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), and paid the DLA a revenue-sharing payment equal to 64.5% of the gross resale proceeds. Scrap property generally consisted of items determined by the DoD to have no use beyond their base material content, such as metals, alloys, and building materials. We bore all of the costs for the sorting, merchandising and sale of the property. The resale transactions for scrap property sourced under this contract followed the purchase model. 
Resale of scrap property that we purchased under the Scrap Contract accounted for 7.4%, 10.2%, and 11.1%, of our total revenues, and 2.6%, 3.6%, and 4.7% of our GMV, in the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
•Surplus Contract.  Under the Surplus Contract, which concluded on June 30, 2018, we acquired, managed and sold usable surplus personal property of the DoD turned into the DLA. We paid the DLA 4.35% of the DoD's original acquisition value for the surplus property, which property consisted of items determined by the DoD to be no longer needed, and not claimed for reuse by any federal agency, such as electronics, industrial equipment, office supplies, scientific and medical equipment, aircraft parts, clothing and textiles. We retained 100% of the profits from the resale of the property and bore all of the costs for the merchandising and sale of the property. The resale transactions for surplus property sourced under this contract followed the purchase model.
Resales of surplus property that we purchased from the DoD under the Surplus Contract, as well as services we provided to the DoD under the Surplus Contract, accounted for 0.0%, 12.4%, and 27.6%, of our total revenues, and 0.0%, 4.1%, and 9.4%, of our GMV, for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for e-commerce has resulted in and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies. Many jurisdictions also regulate "auctions" and "auctioneers" and may regulate online auction services. These consumer protection laws and regulations could cause substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.
In many states, there is great uncertainty about whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, auctions and auctioneering, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. New legislation or regulation, applying laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could cause significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These potential restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. Further, we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.
For our contracts with commercial businesses and government sellers, our sellers may audit and review our performance on our contracts, and our compliance with laws and regulations. 
Within the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") strengthens the existing data protection regulations in the EU in connection with the collection, storage, retention, use, processing, transmission, sharing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data. The GDPR applies to all EU citizens' data, regardless of whether such data is collected, stored or processed within the EU. Penalties for non-compliance with the GDPR are considerable, allowing EU regulators to impose a monetary penalty equal to the greater of €100 million or 4% of a non-compliant organization's worldwide annual sales. Such fines would be in addition to the rights of individuals to sue for damages in respect of any data privacy breach which causes them to suffer loss. As Internet commerce and related technologies continue to evolve, thereby increasing a service provider's capacity to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process and transmit large volumes of personal information, increasingly restrictive regulation by international, federal, and state agencies becomes more likely. We believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulation in the field of data privacy and security is likely in both the United States and in other jurisdictions, possibly as or more restrictive as the EU model. Obligations and restrictions imposed by current and future applicable laws, regulations, contracts and industry standards may affect our ability to provide all the current features of our products and services, and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. 
Intellectual Property
We regard our intellectual property, particularly domain names, copyrights and trade secrets, as critical to our success. We rely on contractual restrictions and common law copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights, know-how, information and technology. These contractual restrictions include confidentiality and non-compete provisions. We generally enter into agreements containing these provisions with our employees, contractors and third parties with whom we have strategic relationships. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization. We are the registered owners of several Internet domain names, including www.liquidation.com, www.govdeals.com, www.networkintl.com, www.secondipity.com, www.go-dove.com, and www.machinio.com. We pursue the registration of our trademarks in the U.S. and internationally. Effective patent, copyright, trademarks, trade secret and domain name protections are expensive to maintain and we may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions and may not succeed in certain jurisdictions.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we had 578 U.S. employees, including 174 in sales and marketing, 60 in technology, 29 in buyer and seller support service, 232 in operations and 83 in finance and administration. In addition, as of that date, we had 109 international employees, including 46 in sales and marketing, 5 in technology, 2 in buyer and seller support service, 38 in operations and 18 in finance and administration.
None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
