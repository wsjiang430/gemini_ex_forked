ITEM 1: BUSINESS 
(dollars in millions)
GENERAL
Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company) automates, digitizes and transforms the way people bank and shop. As a partner to the majority of the world's top 100 financial institutions and top 25 global retailers, the Company's integrated solutions connect digital and physical channels conveniently, securely and efficiently for millions of consumers each day. The Company has a presence in more than 100 countries with approximately 21,000 employees worldwide. 
Strategy
The Company seeks to continually enhance the consumer experience at bank and retail locations while simultaneously streamlining cost structures and business processes through the smart integration of hardware, software and services. The Company partners with other leading technology companies and regularly refines its research and development (R&D) spend to support a better transaction experience for consumers.
Operational priorities
The Company is establishing foundational priorities to support its business in 2023 and beyond, working toward one objective - to deliver on its operating model unit economic goals as one team and one company. The Company will focus on three simple priorities:
•Deliver its products to customers and maintain operational excellence;
•Stabilize and grow its recurring revenue, leveraging its core expertise; and
•Reinvigorate its culture - embracing the Company's heritage and taking pride in its accomplishments.
Primarily, the Company is committed to building and delivering its core solutions to our customers with a strong focus on unit conversion economics, upon which its business model is largely based. The Company believes this is the most simple and effective way to evaluate performance from an operational standpoint.
By focusing on delivery and revenue recognition of product units, the Company will be well-positioned to execute on its business model and move toward stability and growth, especially as it continues to see consistent demand for its Banking and Retail solutions in the market. Stabilizing its business around core expertise to drive growth is expected to expand the Company’s services and software revenue opportunities, creating longer-term value and revenue sources.
The Company is also focused on reinvigorating its culture. Our people make Diebold Nixdorf great, and we are taking a fresh perspective with several initiatives planned to accomplish this goal. 
Services and Product Solutions
The Company offers a broad portfolio of solutions designed to automate, digitize and transform the way people bank and shop. As a result, the Company’s operating structure is focused on its two customer segments — Banking and Retail. Leveraging a broad portfolio of solutions, the Company offers customers the flexibility to purchase combinations of services, software and products that drive the most value to their business.
Banking
The Company provides integrated solutions for financial institutions of all sizes designed to help drive operational efficiencies, differentiate the consumer experience, grow revenue and manage risk. 
Banking Services 
Services represents the largest operational component of the Company and includes product-related services, implementation services and managed services. Product-related services incidents are managed through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. The portfolio includes contracted maintenance, preventive maintenance, “on-demand” maintenance and total implementation services. Implementation services help our customers effectively respond to changing customer demands and includes scalable solutions based on globally standardized processes and tools, a single point of contact and reliable local expertise. Managed services and outsourcing consists of managing the end-to-end business processes and technology integration. Our integrated business solutions include self-service fleet management, branch life-cycle management and ATM as-a-service capabilities.
The Company's DN Vynamic software is the first end-to-end software portfolio in the banking marketplace designed to simplify and enhance the consumer experience. This platform is cloud-native, provides new capabilities and supports advanced transactions via open application program interface (API). In addition, the Company’s software suite simplifies operations by eliminating the traditional focus on internal silos and enabling inter-connected partnerships between financial institutions and payment providers. Through its open approach, DN Vynamic brings together legacy systems, enabling new levels of connectivity, integration, and interoperability. The Company’s software suite provides a shared analytic and transaction engine. The DN Vynamic platform can generate new insights to enhance operations; prioritizing consumer preferences rather than technology.
In 2020, the Company launched the AllConnectSM Data Engine (ACDE), which enables a more data-driven and predictive approach to services. As of December 31, 2022, more than 175,000 devices were connected to ACDE. As the number of connected devices increases, the Company expects to benefit from more efficient and cost-effective operations.
Banking Products
The banking portfolio of products consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation and kiosk technologies. As financial institutions seek to expand their self-service transaction set and reduce operating costs by shrinking their physical branch footprint, the Company offers the DN Series™ family of self-service solutions.
DN Series is the culmination of several years of investment in consumer research, design and engineering resources. Key benefits and features of DN Series include:
•superior availability and performance; 
•next-generation cash recycling technology;
•full integration with the DN Vynamic™ software suite;
•a modular and upgradeable design which enables customers to respond more quickly to changing customer demands; 
•higher note capacity and processing power;
•improved security safeguards to protect customers against emerging physical, data and cyber threats;
•physical footprint as much as 40% less vs. competing ATMs in certain models;
•made of recycled and recyclable materials and is 25% lighter than most traditional ATMs, reducing CO2 emissions both in the manufacturing and transportation of components and terminals;
•uses LED technology and highly efficient electrical systems, resulting in up to 50% power savings versus traditional ATMs; and
•increased branding options for financial institutions.
Retail
The Company’s comprehensive portfolio of retail solutions, software and services improves the checkout process for retailers while enhancing shopping experiences for consumers.
Retail Services
Diebold Nixdorf AllConnect Services® for retailers include maintenance and availability services to continuously optimize the performance and total cost of ownership of retail touchpoints, such as checkout, self-service and mobile devices, as well as critical store infrastructure. The solutions portfolio includes: implementation services to expand, modernize or upgrade store concepts; maintenance services for on-site incident resolution and restoration of multivendor solutions; support services for on-demand service desk support; operations services for remote monitoring of stationary and mobile endpoint hardware; as well as application services for remote monitoring of multivendor software and planned software deployments and data moves. As a single point of contact, service personnel plan and supervise store openings, renewals and transformation projects, with attention to local details and customers’ global IT infrastructure.
The DN Vynamic software suite for retailers provides a comprehensive, modular and open solution ranging from the in-store check-out to solutions across multiple channels that improve end-to-end store processes and facilitate continuous consumer engagements in support of a digital ecosystem. This includes click & collect, reserve & collect, in-store ordering and return-to-store processes across the retailers' physical and digital sales channels. Operational data from a number of sources, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), POS, store systems and customer relationship management systems (CRM), may be integrated across all customer connection points to create seamless and differentiated consumer experiences.
In 2021, the Company announced it entered the electric vehicle (EV) charging station services business, a market with a customer profile potentially comparable to the existing retail business. Our global services capability, including our technicians, our skills in global spare parts logistics management, and multi-lingual help desks have initially resonated with market participants who own public charging stations. 
Retail Products
The retail product portfolio includes self-checkout (SCO) products and ordering kiosks facilitate a seamless and efficient transaction experience. The BEETLE®/iSCAN EASY eXpress™, hybrid products, can alternate from attended operation to SCO with the press of a button. The K-two Kiosk automates routine tasks and in-store transactions, offers order-taking abilities, particularly at quick service restaurants (QSRs) and fast casual restaurants and presents functionality that furthers store automation and digitalization. The retail product portfolio also includes modular and integrated, “all-in-one” point of sale (POS) and self-service terminals that meet changing consumer shopping journeys, as well as retailers’ and store staff’s automation requirements. Supplementing the POS system is a broad range of peripherals, including printers, scales and mobile scanners, as well as the cash management portfolio, which offers a wide range of banknote and coin processing systems. Additionally, our retail software solutions are inclusive of a cloud native software platform which is hardware agnostic and multi-vendor capable. 
COMPETITION
The Company competes with global, regional and local competitors to provide technology solutions for financial institutions and retailers. The Company differentiates its offerings by providing a wide range of dynamic solutions that leverage innovations in advanced security, biometric authentication, mobile connectivity, contactless transactions, cloud computing and Internet of Things (IOT). Based upon independent industry surveys from Retail Banking Research (RBR), the Company is a leading service provider and manufacturer of self-service solutions across the globe. 
Competitors in the self-service banking market include NCR, Nautilus Hyosung, GRG Banking Equipment, Glory Global Solutions, Oki Data and Triton Systems, as well as a number of local manufacturing and service providers such as Fujitsu and Hitachi-Omron in Asia Pacific (AP); Hantle/GenMega in North America (NA); KEBA in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Perto in Latin America (LA). 
In certain countries, the Company sells to and/or competes with independent ATM deployers, such as Payment Alliance International and Euronet, that primarily operate in the non-bank retail market.
In the retail market, the Company helps retailers transform their stores to a consumer-centric approach by providing POS, automated SCO solutions, cash management, software and services. The Company competes with some of the key players highlighted above plus other technology firms such as Toshiba and Fujitsu, and specialized software players such as GK Software, Oracle, Aptos and PCMS. Many retailers also work with proprietary software solutions.
For its services offerings, the Company perceives competition to be fragmented, especially in the product-related services segment. While other manufacturers provide basic levels of product support, the competition also includes local and regional third-party providers. With respect to higher value managed services, the Company competes with large IT service providers such as IBM, Atos, Fiserv and DXC Technology.
In the self-service software market, the Company, in addition to the key hardware players highlighted above, competes with several smaller, niche software companies like KAL, and with the internal software development teams of banks and retailers.
OPERATIONS
The Company’s operating results and the amount and timing of revenue are affected by numerous factors, including supply chain, production schedules, customer priorities, sales volume and mix. During the past several years, the Company has honed its offerings to become a total solutions provider. As a result of the emphasis on services and software, the nature of the Company's workforce is changing and requires new skill sets in areas such as:
•advanced security and compliance measures;
•advanced sensors;
•IOT;
•modern field services operations;
•cloud computing;
•analytics; and
•as-a-service expertise.
The principal raw materials used by the Company in its manufacturing operations are steel, plastics, electronic parts and components and spare parts, which are purchased from various major suppliers. 
The Company carries working capital mainly related to trade receivables and inventories. Inventories generally are manufactured or purchased as orders are received from customers. The Company’s customary payment terms typically range from 30 to 90 days from date of invoice. The Company generally does not offer extended payment terms. The Company also provides financing arrangements to customers that are largely classified and accounted for as sales-type leases.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
We are a world leader in automating, digitizing, and transforming the way people bank and shop. However, we would not be in that position without our employees, one of our most valuable assets. Diebold Nixdorf is improving the employee experience by leveraging best practices and investing in the tools necessary to develop and reward talent across the Company.
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 21,000 associates globally in more than 100 countries.
Culture
We govern our actions by our shared values: Accountability, Collaboration, Decisiveness, a Sense of Urgency and a Willingness to Change. Additionally, we have a CARE Council, which stands for Considerate, Aware, Responsible and Empathetic – four behaviors we expect all employees to model on a daily basis. Together, our values and CARE Council help employees feel appreciated, involved, connected and supported, and that they have equal opportunity to succeed. We continue to drive our cultural evolution through our diversity and inclusion programs, employee resource groups, robust internal communications and performance management process.
Diversity and Inclusion
The Company is committed to establishing a culture of diversity and inclusion where everyone is accepted, valued, supported and encouraged to thrive. We value the different perspectives and solutions our communities bring to the Company, and we believe these perspectives have a positive impact on how we innovate and grow. Our expectation is that our diversity and inclusion program will guide improvements in our culture - specifically, recruiting, training, policies and reporting, leader expectations, and benefits. In 2022, we continued to promote employee resource groups, including Women in the Workplace, DN Pride and Multi-Cultural. We are continuing to enhance our diversity and inclusion initiatives, in conjunction with our CARE Council, to recruit, retain and promote a diverse workforce. These efforts will not only promote innovation and growth but will also strengthen our relationships with customers spanning more than 100 countries with diverse cultural, gender, racial and other profiles.
Employee Engagement
We have invested in our internal communications resources to better engage our employees. We have an internal intranet, called The Exchange, to keep employees informed about key changes to our business, new product launches and progress on strategic initiatives.
Talent
To maintain a competitive workforce, the Company is evolving and enhancing how we train, identify and promote key talent. Additionally, the Company has continually improved and standardized our employee review process – encouraging regular performance reviews and feedback that will set clear expectations, motivate employees and reinforce the connection between pay and performance. In 2021, we expanded our global talent review program for talent development and succession planning to go deeper into our organization below senior leadership roles. Recently, retention bonuses were provided to retain certain employees within leadership positions.
Health, Safety and Wellness
Throughout our history, we have maintained our commitment to providing a safe workplace that protects against and limits personal injury and environmental harm. We follow international standards and regulations for product safety and security. Our Design-For-Quality approach covers R&D Quality, Manufacturing Quality and Supplier Quality. During the course of product development, these functions regularly participate in solution requirements and specification reviews. In the later phases of development, we define and perform various tests to ensure Product Safety and Security. We evaluate risks using both government-required procedures and best practices to ensure we understand residual risk and appropriately protect our employees. Frequent training ensures that specialists are informed promptly about legal and internal requirements.
Additionally, since the global outbreak of COVID-19, we have continued to evaluate and enhance our health, safety, and wellness protocols. Our designation as an essential service provider in numerous locations around the world required us to respond and address health and safety issues in real time. We have addressed these challenges with the following measures:
•implementing our comprehensive Pandemic Response Plan to ensure the continuity of our operations while protecting the health and safety of our people;
•instituting new safety and cautionary procedures for front-line employees to ensure their safety; 
•providing sanitizing materials and guidance for working in common work areas;
•requiring employees to comply with quarantining requirements;
•sanitizing our production facilities and issuing stringent guidance on prohibiting unnecessary visitors and contractors from entering our manufacturing facilities; and
•establishing/adhering to stringent hygiene protocols, including handwashing, no admittance by anyone exhibiting cold or flu-like symptoms, temperature checks and social distancing to the fullest extent possible.
Compensation
Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees and to maintain a strong pay for performance culture. We regularly assess the current business environment and labor market to ensure our compensation programs reflect current best practices. We benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data for our jobs. We believe that these practices will help to motivate and engage our broader base of employees resulting in sustained increases in shareholder value and reflects our compensation philosophy in aligning long-term pay and performance.
PRODUCT BACKLOG
The Company's product backlog was approximately $1,400 and $1,100 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The backlog generally includes orders estimated or projected to be shipped or installed within 18 months. Although the Company believes the orders included in the backlog are firm and are sometimes paid in advance, some orders may be canceled by customers without penalty, and the Company may elect to permit cancellation of orders without penalty where management believes it is in the Company's best interests to do so. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant cancellations within its product backlog. Additionally, over 50 percent of the Company's revenues are derived from its service business, for which backlog information is not measured. Therefore, the Company does not believe that its product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of revenues for any future period.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES
The Company owns patents, trademarks and licenses relating to certain products across the globe. While the Company regards these as items of importance, it does not deem its business as a whole, or any industry segment, to be materially dependent upon any one item or group of items. The Company intends to protect and defend its intellectual property, including pursuit of infringing third parties for damages and other appropriate remedies.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. Notwithstanding their complexity, our compliance with these laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, generally, does not, and is not expected to, have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future.
