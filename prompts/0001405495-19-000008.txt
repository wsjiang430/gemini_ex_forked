Item 1. | BUSINESS.

Overview
InterDigital, Inc. ("InterDigital") designs and develops advanced technologies that enable and enhance wireless communications and capabilities. Since our founding in 1972, our engineers have designed and developed a wide range of innovations that are used in digital cellular and wireless products and networks, including 2G, 3G, 4G and IEEE 802-related products and networks, as well as video processing, coding and display technology. We are a leading contributor of innovation to the wireless communications industry, as well as a leading holder of patents in the video industry. 
Given our long history and focus on advanced research and development, InterDigital has one of the most significant patent portfolios in the wireless and video industries. As of December 31, 2018, InterDigital's wholly owned subsidiaries held a portfolio of approximately 34,000 patents and patent applications related to a range of technologies, including the fundamental technologies that enable wireless communications, video encoding, display technology, and other areas relevant to the wireless and consumer electronics industries. In that portfolio are a number of patents and patent applications that we believe are or may be essential or may become essential to standards in cellular and other wireless communications as well as video encoding. Those wireless standards include 3G, 4G and the IEEE 802 suite of standards, as well as patents and patent applications that we believe are or may become essential to 5G standards that currently exist and are under continued development. In terms of video technology, our portfolio includes patents and applications relating to standards established by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG), the ITU-T Video Coding Expert Group (VCEG), the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) and the Joint Video Expert Team (JVET), among others.
The wireless portfolio has largely been built through internal development, supplemented by joint development projects with other companies as well as select acquisitions of patents and companies. Products incorporating our patented inventions in wireless include: mobile devices, such as cellular phones, tablets, notebook computers and wireless personal digital assistants; wireless infrastructure equipment, such as base stations; components, dongles and modules for wireless devices; and IoT devices and software platforms. The video technology portfolio largely represents patents and applications that InterDigital acquired through our purchase of Technicolor SA’s patent licensing business (the "Technicolor Acquisition"), completed in July 2018, supplemented by internal development in the area of video technology. Products incorporating our patented inventions in video include cellular phones, tablets, notebook computers, computers, televisions, gaming consoles, set-top boxes, streaming devices and other consumer electronics.
InterDigital derives revenues primarily from patent licensing, with contributions from patent sales, product sales, technology solutions licensing and sales and engineering services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of new revenue accounting guidance, ASU No. 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" ("ASC 606"), using the modified retrospective method. Consistent with the modified retrospective adoption method, our results of operations for periods prior to our adoption of ASC 606 remain unchanged and are presented in accordance with ASC Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition" (“ASC 605”).
In 2018, our total revenues under ASC 606 were $307.4 million, whereas total revenues under ASC 605 would have been $382.1 million. In 2018, our recurring revenues, consisting of current patent royalties and current technology solutions revenue, were $280.3 million under ASC 606, and would have been $365.0 million under ASC 605. Total revenues in 2017 under ASC 605 were $532.9 million, which included $370.0 million of recurring revenues. Additional information about our revenues, the impacts of our adoption of ASC 606, profits and assets, as well as additional financial data, is provided in the selected financial data in Part II, Item 6, and in the financial statements and accompanying Notes in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to continue to be a leading designer and developer of technology solutions and innovation for the mobile and consumer electronics industries and to monetize those solutions and innovations through a combination of licensing, sales and other revenue opportunities.
To execute our strategy, we intend to:

• | Develop and source innovative technologies related to wireless and video. We intend to grow or maintain a leading position in advanced mobile technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), video processing and coding, and other related technology areas by leveraging our expertise to guide internal research and development capabilities, direct our efforts in partnering with leading inventors and industry players to source new technologies and pursue select acquisitions of technologies, businesses and/or companies.

• | Establish and grow our patent-based revenue. We intend to grow our licensing revenue base by adding licensees, expanding into adjacent and new technology areas that align with our intellectual property position and leveraging the continued growth of the overall mobile technology market. Those licensing efforts can be self-driven or executed in conjunction with licensing partnerships, trusts and other efforts, and may involve the vigorous defense of our intellectual property through litigation and other means. We also believe that our ongoing research efforts and associated patenting activities enable us to sell patent assets that are not vital to our core licensing programs, as well as to execute patent swaps that can strengthen our overall portfolio. 


• | Maintain a collaborative relationship with key industry players and worldwide standards bodies. We intend to continue contributing to the ongoing process of defining mobile and video standards and other industry-wide efforts and incorporating our inventions into those technology areas. Those efforts, and the knowledge gained through them, support internal development efforts and also help guide technology and intellectual property sourcing through partners and other external sources. 


• | Pursue commercial opportunities for our advanced platforms and solutions. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, InterDigital often builds out entire functioning platforms in various technology areas. We seek to bring those technologies, as well as other technologies we may develop or acquire, to market through various methods including technology licensing, stand-alone commercial initiatives, joint ventures and partnerships. 

Technology Research and Development
InterDigital pursues a diversified approach to sourcing the innovations that underpin our business. That approach incorporates internally driven research and development efforts by InterDigital Labs, a research collaboration with Technicolor SA’s Research and Innovation unit as part of the Technicolor Acquisition, and select acquisitions of technology innovations, businesses and/or companies. Our efforts are guided by our vision of the future of technology, Creating the Living NetworkTM, which is articulated around the variables of content, context and connectivity, and how the interplay of these elements drives future technology capabilities and needs.    
As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consisted of approximately 4,400 U.S. patents (approximately 400 of which were issued in 2018) and approximately 20,400 non-U.S. patents (approximately 2,100 of which were issued in 2018). As of the same date, we also had numerous patent applications pending worldwide, with approximately 1,700 applications pending in the United States and approximately 7,200 pending non-U.S. applications. The patents and applications comprising our portfolio relate to a broad range of technologies, including digital wireless radiotelephony (including, without limitation, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies) and video coding.  Issued patents expire at differing times ranging from 2019 through 2037.  We operate ten research and development facilities in five countries: Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, USA; Buffalo and Melville, New York, USA; Rockville, Maryland, USA; San Diego, California, USA; Princeton, New Jersey, USA; Montreal, Quebec, Canada; London, England, United Kingdom; Berlin, Germany; and Seoul, South Korea.
InterDigital Labs
As an early and ongoing participant in the digital wireless market, InterDigital developed pioneering solutions for the primary cellular air interface technologies in use today, TDMA and CDMA. That early involvement, our continued development of those advanced digital wireless technologies and innovations in OFDM/OFDMA and MIMO technologies have enabled us to create our significant worldwide portfolio of patents. In addition, InterDigital was among the first companies to participate in standardization and platform development efforts related to Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications and IoT technology. In conjunction with our participation in certain standards bodies, we have filed declarations stating that we have patents that we believe are or may be essential or may become essential to cellular and other mobile industry standards and that, with respect to our essential patents, we are prepared to grant licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or similar terms consistent with the requirements of the respective standards organizations.
Our capabilities in the development of advanced mobile technologies are based on the efforts of a highly specialized engineering team, leveraging leading-edge equipment and software platforms. As of December 31, 2018, InterDigital employed approximately 185 engineers, approximately 80% of whom hold advanced degrees (including 65 doctorate degrees).  Over the last three years, investment in development has ranged from $69.7 million to $75.7 million, and the largest portion of this expense has been personnel costs. Additional information about our development expenses is provided in the results of operations, under the heading "Operating Expenses," in Part II, Item 7, of this Form 10-K.
Our current research efforts are focused on a variety of areas related to mobile technology and devices, including cellular wireless technology, Internet of Things ("IoT") technology, advanced video coding and transmission, and advanced sensor and sensor fusion technology.

Cellular Wireless Technology
We have a long history of developing cellular technologies, including those related to CDMA and TDMA and, more recently, OFDM/OFDMA and MIMO. A number of our inventions are being used in all 2G, 3G and 4G wireless networks and mobile terminal devices. We led the industry in establishing TDMA-based TIA/EIA/IS-54 as a U.S. digital wireless standard in the 1980s as well as innovative CDMA and OFDM/OFDMA technology solutions and, today, we hold a significant worldwide portfolio of patents and patent applications for these technologies. Similar to our TDMA inventions, we believe that a number of our CDMA and OFDM/OFDMA inventions are, may be or may become essential to the implementation of CDMA and OFDM/OFDMA-based systems in use today.
We also continue to be engaged in development efforts to build and enhance our 3GPP technology portfolio in areas including 5G NR, LTE-Advanced, and cellular IoT. Some of our inventions include or relate to MIMO technologies for reducing interference and increasing data rates; power control; hybrid-ARQ for fast error correction; control channel structures for efficient signaling; multi-carrier operation; vehicular-centric communications (V2X); millimeter wave communications; network slicing; core network procedures, and other areas. We also continue to develop additional technologies in response to existing or perceived challenges of connected devices in the expanding terminal markets. These include technologies for automobiles, wearables, smart homes, drones, and other connected consumer electronic products. We are developing solutions that enable connectivity in both licensed and unlicensed spectrum, and across a large range of frequencies up to the millimeter wave bands.
Our strong wireless network background includes engineering and corporate development activities that focus on solutions that apply to 3GPP and other wireless market segments. Segments outside of 3GPP primarily fall within the scope of the IEEE 802, IETF and ETSI standards. We continue to grow a portfolio of technology related to Wi-Fi, Internet Standards, and Edge Computing, that includes, for example, improvements to the IEEE 802.11 PHY and MAC to increase peak data rates (802.11ax, 802.11ay), integrated access and backhaul, and terminal mobility for edge and fog computing services.
Video Encoding and Transmission Technology
An important and growing segment of wireless traffic is devoted to video streaming, and InterDigital has been active for a number of years in developing advanced technologies that address the challenges of video as it relates to mobile. Specifically, in the area of video research and standards, we have been actively engaged in video standards development work in the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG), the ITU-T Video Coding Expert Group (VCEG), the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) and the Joint Video Expert Team (JVET). Those efforts have focused on H.265/HEVC versions 1 to 4 and MPEG DASH, as well as FVC/H.266 and the MPEG Immersive (MPEG-I) standards suite going forward. In addition, as part of the Technicolor Acquisition, InterDigital benefits from a research agreement with Technicolor’s Research and Innovation unit pursuant to which InterDigital owns the patents produced through Technicolor’s ongoing research in defined project areas, including FVC/H.266. If our previously announced acquisition of Technicolor's Research and Innovation unit closes, this research agreement would be terminated. 
IoT Technology
In the field of IoT applications, we are developing technologies to enable seamless interconnection for multiple access types (cellular, WLAN, LPWA) and IoT service frameworks that can be managed by a customer and leveraged by a diverse set of vertical applications. These technologies build on our expertise in developing platforms and contributing technologies towards the advancement of global M2M and IoT standards. As part of, and in addition to, InterDigital’s standards-focused development, we have two solutions that are being made available commercially.
In October 2017, we launched our Smart City-focused Chordant™ business. The Chordant platform, which was originally introduced in 2015 as the oneMPOWER™ platform, enables interoperability and scalability focusing specifically on the Smart Cities industry segment. This secure and scalable horizontal platform helps businesses launch and manage IoT data and applications, and features a comprehensive suite of application enabling services that span connectivity, device, data, security, and transaction management. The Chordant platform is compliant with oneM2M, the global standard for horizontal IoT platforms, and is designed for interoperability across diverse vertical markets, networks, and devices. The solution is based on an open standard with a long-term features roadmap, which interworks with many existing industry protocols and alliances. In February 2018, we announced the launch in the U.K of the oneTRANSPORT™ data marketplace, which operates on the Chordant platform.  This commercial service provides a common interface to multiple service providers, allowing public authorities to control and monetize, and companies to access, IoT data in a simpler fashion via a real-time, low-latency service-oriented architecture. In December 2018, InterDigital announced that an affiliate of Sony Corporation of America (“Sony”) had invested in Chordant as part of entering into a new patent license agreement.

Other Technology Areas and Sources
Because mobile technology today and into the future encompasses a very broad range of areas, we are also developing a range of technologies in the areas of security and analytics, sensor technologies, as well as other areas. Some of those efforts are related to technology standards. 
In addition, to supplement our own development efforts, the Company pursues an external technology sourcing model based around partnerships with leading research organizations and consortia. Those efforts include a range of universities conducting sponsored research, agreements with various research institutions, and membership and collaborative research in various initiatives such as Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR), NYU Wireless, 5Tonic and Bristol is Open.    
Our Revenue Sources
Patent-Based Revenue
We believe that companies making, importing, using or selling products compliant with the standards covered by our patent portfolio, including all manufacturers of mobile handsets, tablets and other devices, require a license under our patents and will require licenses under patents that may issue from our pending patent applications. We have successfully entered into license agreements with many of the leading mobile communications companies globally, including Apple Inc. (“Apple”), HTC Corporation, Kyocera Corporation (“Kyocera”), LG Electronics, Inc. (“LG”), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) and Sony, among others. We also receive revenue under certain license agreements that we assumed as part of the Technicolor Acquisition.
Most of our patent license agreements are structured on a royalty-bearing basis, while others are structured on a paid-up basis or a combination thereof. Upon entering into a new patent license agreement, the licensee typically agrees to pay consideration for sales made prior to the effective date of the license agreement (i.e., non-current patent royalties) and also agrees to pay royalties or license fees on licensed products sold during the term of the agreement. We expect that, for the most part, new license agreements will follow this model. Almost all of our patent license agreements provide for the payment of royalties based on sales of licensed products designed to operate in accordance with particular standards (convenience-based licenses), as opposed to the payment of royalties if the manufacture, sale or use of the licensed product infringes one of our patents (infringement-based licenses).
Some of our patent licenses are paid up, requiring no additional payments relating to designated sales under agreed upon conditions. Those conditions can include paid-up licenses for a period of time (fixed-fee agreements), for a class of products, for a number of products sold, under certain patents or patent claims, for sales in certain countries or a combination thereof. Licenses become paid-up based on the payment of fixed amounts or after the payment of royalties for a term. 
Some of our patent license agreements provide for the non-refundable prepayment of royalties that are usually made in exchange for prepayment discounts. As the licensee reports sales of covered products, the royalties are calculated and either applied against any prepayment or become payable in cash or other consideration. Additionally, royalties on sales of licensed products under the license agreement become payable or applied against prepayments based on the royalty formula applicable to the particular license agreement. These formulas include flat dollar rates per unit, a percentage of sales, a percentage of sales with a per-unit cap and other similar measures. The formulas can also vary by other factors, including territory, covered standards, quantity and dates sold. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that give us the right to audit our licensees' books and records to ensure compliance with the licensees' reporting and payment obligations under those agreements. From time to time, these audits reveal underreporting or underpayments under the applicable agreements. In such cases, we seek payment for the amount owed and enter into negotiations with the licensee to resolve the discrepancy.
For a discussion of our revenue recognition policies with respect to patent license agreements, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition - Patent License Agreements.”
In addition, in 2013, InterDigital formed the Signal Trust for Wireless Innovation (the “Signal Trust”). The goal of the Signal Trust is to monetize a large patent portfolio related to cellular infrastructure. More than 500 patents and patent applications were transferred from InterDigital to the Signal Trust, focusing primarily on 3G and LTE technologies and developed by InterDigital's engineers and researchers over more than a decade. A number of these innovations have been contributed to the worldwide standards process, resulting in a portfolio that includes patents for pioneering inventions that we believe are used pervasively in the cellular wireless industry. InterDigital is the primary beneficiary of the Signal Trust. The distributions from the Signal Trust will support continued research related to cellular wireless technologies. A small portion of the proceeds from the Signal Trust will be used to fund, through the Signal Foundation for Wireless Innovation, scholarly analysis of intellectual property rights and the technological, commercial and creative innovations they facilitate.

In third quarter 2016, InterDigital joined Avanci, the industry’s first marketplace for the licensing of cellular standards-essential technology for the IoT. The licensing platform brings together some of InterDigital’s peers in standards-essential technology leadership, and makes 2G, 3G and 4G standards-essential patents available to IoT players in specific product segments with one flat-rate license. The Avanci licensing programs in specific product segments for the IoT industry will provide access to the entire applicable standards-essential wireless patent portfolios held by all of the platform participants, as well as any additions to their portfolios during the term of the license. In December 2017, Avanci announced that it had signed a patent license agreement with BMW Group.
We also pursue, on occasion, targeted sales of portions of our patent portfolio. This strategy is based on the expectation that our portfolio and continued research efforts extend well beyond the requirements for a successful licensing program. In addition, the strategy leverages the desire from new entrants in the mobile technology space to build strong intellectual property positions to support their businesses.
Other Potential Revenue Opportunities
Our strong technology expertise and research and development team also form the basis for other potential revenue opportunities, focused around areas such as engineering services, research joint ventures and the continued development, commercialization and licensing of research and development projects that have progressed to a pre-commercial or commercial phase. We also currently recognize revenue from the licensing of technology that has been developed by our engineering teams and is integrated into other companies’ technology products.
In all of its technology areas, InterDigital works to incubate and commercialize market-ready technologies. These include technologies that were developed as part of our standards development efforts, as well as technologies developed outside the scope of those efforts. Those commercial efforts sometimes include the establishment of a separate commercial initiative focused on the specific opportunity. Although these initiatives are in their early stages, they are potential revenue opportunities for the Company.
In 2012, we formed of a joint venture with Sony called Convida Wireless. The joint venture combined InterDigital's advanced M2M research capabilities with Sony's consumer electronics expertise with the purpose of driving new research in IoT communications and other connectivity areas. This joint venture was renewed in 2015 with its focus expanded to include advanced research and development into 5G and future wireless technologies, and renewed again in 2018 with its focus sharpened on 5G, including IoT and infrastructure research.
Overview of Wireless Communications and Consumer Electronics Industries 
The wireless communications industry continues to experience rapid growth worldwide, as well as an expansion of device types entering the market. In addition, new markets are emerging related to wireless connectivity. IoT is an important new market in the technology field, which is expected to result in a significant increase in the number of connections, and unlock new business capabilities. IoT is currently in its earliest stages, and estimates vary broadly as far as how many connections it will yield, but by some estimates there could be as many as 120 billion connected devices by 2030, a significant portion of which will be comprised of 3G, 4G and 5G cellular IoT devices. 
To achieve economies of scale and support interoperability among different participants, products for the wireless industry have typically been designed to operate in accordance with certain standards. Wireless communications standards are formal guidelines for engineers, designers, manufacturers and service providers that regulate and define the use of the radio frequency spectrum in conjunction with providing detailed specifications for wireless communications products. A primary goal of the standards is to ensure interoperability of products marketed by multiple companies. A large number of international and regional wireless Standards Development Organizations (“SDOs”), including the ITU, ETSI, TIA (USA), IEEE, ATIS (USA), TTA (Korea), ARIB (Japan) and ANSI, have responsibility for the development and administration of wireless communications standards. New standards are typically adopted with each new generation of products, are often compatible with previous generations and are defined to ensure equipment interoperability and regulatory compliance.
With the completion of the Technicolor Acquisition and the integration of that portfolio into our overall licensing efforts, InterDigital now expects to expand its business into the broader consumer electronics industry. According to data from ABI Research, more than 2 billion devices in the video, audio and IoT/other technology areas were shipped in 2017. Those devices include TV displays, computer displays, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, wireless assistants and headphones, wearables, smart home devices and other types of consumer electronic devices that implement video or wireless technologies, or a combination of both. Some of those technologies are standards-based, such as Wi-Fi and other wireless technologies, various video coding standards and various broadcast standards. 
Standards have evolved in response to consumer demand for services and expanded capabilities of mobile devices and other consumer electronics devices. For instance, cellular standards have evolved from voice-oriented services to multimedia 
8

services that exploit the higher speeds offered by newer technologies, such as LTE. The wireless communications industry has also made significant advances in non-cellular wireless technologies.
SDOs typically ask participating companies to declare formally whether they believe they hold patents or patent applications essential to a particular standard and whether they are willing to license those patents on either a royalty-bearing basis on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms or on a royalty-free basis. To manufacture, have made, sell, offer to sell or use such products on a non-infringing basis, a manufacturer or other entity doing so must first obtain a license from the holder of essential patent rights. The SDOs do not have enforcement authority against entities that fail to obtain required licenses, nor do they have the ability to protect the intellectual property rights of holders of essential patents.
InterDigital often publicly characterizes aspects of its business, including license agreements and development projects, as pertaining to broad mobile industry standards such as, for example, 3G, 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi. In doing this, we generally rely on the positions of the applicable standards-setting organizations in defining the relevant standards. However, the definitions may evolve or change over time, including after we have characterized certain transactions.
Business Activities
2018 Patent Licensing Activity
During first quarter 2018 we entered into a multi-year, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing patent license agreement with Kyocera Corporation. The agreement covers sales by Kyocera Corporation and its affiliates of terminal unit products designed to operate in accordance with WCDMA and LTE standards, providing Kyocera expanded coverage for products in addition to those covered under their existing license agreement with InterDigital.
Also during first quarter 2018, the Signal Trust, established by the Company in 2013, signed a patent license agreement with a provider of telecommunications infrastructure equipment. The Signal Trust holds a patent portfolio related to cellular infrastructure, and it is a variable interest entity. Based on the terms of the trust agreement, we previously determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the Signal Trust for accounting purposes and, therefore, must consolidate the Signal Trust. 
During second quarter 2018, we entered into a multi-year, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing patent license agreement with Fujitsu Connected Technologies Limited (“FCNT”).  The agreement covers the sale of FCNT’s 2G, 3G and 4G terminal unit products, including LTE and LTE-Advanced products.
Also during second quarter 2018, we entered into a multi-year, world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty bearing patent license agreement with a US-headquartered company.  The agreement covers sales by the US company of 802.11 functionality within certain of its products.
During fourth quarter 2018, we entered into a multi-year, worldwide, non-exclusive patent license agreement with Sony (the “Sony PLA”), a global leader and technology innovator in consumer electronics, mobile communications and home appliances. In addition, we renewed our joint venture with Sony, Convida Wireless, and sharpened its focus on 5G, including IoT and infrastructure research. The new Sony PLA covers the sale by Sony of covered products for the three-year period that commenced on December 1, 2018.
Customers Generating Revenues Exceeding 10% of Total 2018 Revenues
Apple, Samsung and LG Electronics comprised approximately 36%, 25% and 10% of our total 2018 revenues, respectively.
In 2016, we entered into a multi-year, royalty-bearing, worldwide and non-exclusive patent license agreement with Apple (the “Apple PLA”). The agreement sets forth terms covering the sale by Apple of its products and services, including, but not limited to, its 3G, 4G and future generation cellular and wireless-enabled products. The Apple PLA gives Apple the right to terminate certain rights and obligations under the license for the period after September 30, 2021, but has the potential to provide a license to Apple for a total of up to six years. During 2018, we recognized a total of $111.7 million of revenue associated with the Apple PLA under ASC 606.
9

In 2014, we entered into a patent license agreement with Samsung (the “Samsung PLA”). The royalty-bearing license agreement sets forth terms covering the sale by Samsung of 3G, 4G and certain future generation wireless products. The Samsung PLA provided Samsung the right to terminate certain rights and obligations under the license for the period after 2017 but had the potential to provide a license to Samsung for a total of ten years, including 2013. Samsung did not elect to terminate such rights and obligations, and the period for such election has expired. Accordingly, the term of our patent license agreement with Samsung ends on December 31, 2022. During 2018, we recognized a total of $78.3 million of revenue associated with the Samsung PLA under ASC 606.
In 2017, we entered into a multi-year, worldwide, non-exclusive patent license agreement with LG (the “LG PLA”), a global leader and technology innovator in consumer electronics, mobile communications and home appliances. The LG PLA covers the 3G, 4G and 5G terminal unit products of LG and its affiliates and sets forth a royalty of cash payments to InterDigital as well as a process for the transfer of patents from LG to InterDigital. The deal also committed the parties to explore cooperation for projects related to the research and development of video and sensor technology for connected and autonomous vehicles. During 2018, we recognized a total of $31.8 million of revenue associated with the LG PLA under ASC 606.
Patent Infringement and Declaratory Judgment Proceedings
From time to time, if we believe a party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture, use and/or sell certain products and such party refuses to do so, we may agree with such party to have royalty rates, or other terms, set by third party adjudicators (such as arbitrators) or, in certain circumstances, we may institute legal action against them. This legal action has typically taken the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding such as a Section 337 proceeding before the United States International Trade Commission (“USITC” or the "Commission"). In a patent infringement lawsuit, we would typically seek damages for past infringement and an injunction against future infringement. In a USITC proceeding, we would seek an exclusion order to bar infringing goods from entry into the United States, as well as a cease and desist order to bar further sales of infringing goods that have already been imported into the United States. Parties may bring administrative and/or judicial challenges to the validity, enforceability, essentiality and/or applicability of our patents to their products. Parties may also allege that our efforts to enter into a license with that party do not comply with any obligations we may have in connection with our participation in standards-setting organizations, and therefore that we are not entitled to the relief that we seek. For example, a party may allege that we have not complied with an obligation to offer a license to that party on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, and may also file antitrust claims or regulatory complaints on that or other bases, and may seek damages or other relief based on such claims. In addition, a party might file a declaratory judgment action to seek a court's declaration that our patents are invalid, unenforceable, not infringed by the other party's products or are not essential. Our response to such a declaratory judgment action may include claims of infringement. When we include claims of infringement in a patent infringement lawsuit, a favorable ruling for the Company can result in the payment of damages for past patent royalties, the setting of a royalty for future sales or issuance by the court of an injunction enjoining the infringer from manufacturing, using and/or selling the infringing product.
Contractual Arbitration Proceedings
We and our licensees, in the normal course of business, may have disagreements as to the rights and obligations of the parties under applicable agreements. For example, we could have a disagreement with a licensee as to the amount of reported sales and royalties. Our patent license agreements typically provide for audit rights as well as private arbitration as the mechanism for resolving disputes, and we may attempt to resolve such disputes in arbitration. In arbitration, licensees may seek to assert various claims, defenses, or counterclaims, such as claims based on waiver, promissory estoppel, breach of contract, fraudulent inducement to contract, antitrust, and unfair competition. Arbitration proceedings can be resolved through an award rendered by the arbitrators or by settlement between the parties. Parties to arbitration might have the right to have the award reviewed in a court of competent jurisdiction. However, based on public policy favoring the use of arbitration, it is generally difficult to have arbitration awards vacated or modified. The party securing an arbitration award may seek to have that award confirmed as a judgment through an enforcement proceeding. The purpose of such a proceeding is to secure a judgment that can be used for, if need be, seizing assets of the other party.
In addition, arbitration may be a particularly effective means for resolving disputes with prospective licensees concerning the appropriate fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory ("FRAND") terms and conditions for license agreements that include standards-essential patents ("SEPs"), particularly where negotiations have otherwise reached an impasse.  Binding arbitration to resolve the terms and conditions of a worldwide FRAND license to our relevant portfolio of SEPs is an efficient and cost-effective mechanism, as it allows the parties to avoid piecemeal litigation in multiple jurisdictions and ensures that an enforceable patent license agreement that is consistent with FRAND commitments will be in place at the end of the arbitration process.  
Competition
With respect to our technology development activities and resulting commercialization efforts, we face competition from companies, including in-house development teams at other wireless device companies and semiconductor companies and wireless operators, developing other and similar technologies that are competitive with our products and solutions that we may market or set forth into the standards-setting arena.
Due to the exclusionary nature of patent rights, we do not compete, in a traditional sense, with other patent holders for patent licensing relationships or sale transactions. Other patent holders do not have the same rights to the inventions and 
10

technologies encompassed by our patent portfolio. In any device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the manufacturer may need to obtain licenses from multiple holders of intellectual property. In licensing our patent portfolio, we compete with other patent holders for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain product or products, which may face practical limitations. We believe that licenses under a number of our patents are required to manufacture and sell 3G, 4G and other wireless products, as well as other consumer electronics devices. However, numerous companies also claim that they hold patents that are or may be essential or may become essential to standards-based technology deployed on wireless products and other consumer electronics devices. To the extent that multiple parties all seek royalties on the same product, the manufacturers could claim to have difficulty in meeting the financial requirements of each patent holder. In the past, certain manufacturers have sought antitrust exemptions to act collectively on a voluntary basis. In addition, certain manufacturers have sought to limit aggregate licensing fees or rates for essential patents.
