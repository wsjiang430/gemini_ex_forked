ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
We are a provider of intelligent wireless solutions including mobile hotspots, routers and modems as well as innovative hardware and software products that support machine-to-machine (M2M) applications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Our M2M and IoT solutions include embedded modules, modems and gateways built to deliver reliable always-on connectivity supporting a broad spectrum of applications. These products are designed to solve wireless connectivity challenges in a variety of vertical markets including video surveillance, digital signage, home security, oil and gas exploration, kiosks, fleet management, smart grid, vehicle diagnostics, telematics and many more.
 
We have a majority ownership position in Franklin Technology Inc. ("FTI"), a research and development company located in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development services to us for our wireless products.
 
Our products are generally marketed and sold directly to wireless operators, and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer base extends primarily from the United States to countries in South America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia.
 
OUR STRUCTURE
 
We incorporated in 1982 in California and reincorporated in Nevada on January 2, 2008.  The reincorporation had no effect on the nature of our business or our management. Our headquarters office is located in San Diego, California. The office is principally composed of marketing, sales, operations, finance and administrative support. It is responsible for all customer-related activities, such as marketing communications, product planning, product management and customer support, along with sales and business development activities on a worldwide basis.  
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary with a majority voting interest of 64.2% (35.8% is owned by non-controlling interests) as of June 30, 2019 and 51.8% (48.2% is owned by non-controlling interests) as of June 30, 2018. In the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings of the subsidiary applicable to non-controlling interests. The increase in the majority voting interest in percentage from 51.8% to 64.2% was due to the purchase of an additional 246,663 shares of the subsidiary, at $0.95 per share by the parent company from three shareholders of the subsidiary.
  
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments.  We identify our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility. We have one reportable segment, consisting of the sale of wireless access products. We generate revenues from four geographic areas, consisting of the United States, the Caribbean and South America, EMEA and Asia. The following enterprise-wide disclosure is prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  The following table contains certain financial information by geographic area:
