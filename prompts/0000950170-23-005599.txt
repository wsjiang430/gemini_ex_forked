Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests.
 We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other items, primarily within our theme parks. For more information concerning our results from operations, see the “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the oceans, environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Our Culture and Social Responsibility” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Recent Developments
 Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic
 Our results of operations for 2022 continued to be impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic due in part to a decline in both international and group-related attendance from historical levels. Additionally, our results of operations for 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the following factors: (i) capacity limitations, modified/limited operations and/or temporary park closures which were in place for portions of the respective periods; (ii) decreased demand due to public concerns and government restrictions associated with the pandemic; and (iii) severe restrictions on international travel.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks with enhanced health, safety and cleaning measures, capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations, which at times included reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. By the end of August 2020, we had reopened 10 of our 12 parks on a limited basis and by the end of the second quarter of 2021, all of our 12 parks were open, and operating without COVID-19 related capacity limitations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our financial results. See further discussion in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Risk Factors” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 1–Description of the Business in the notes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Current Operating Environment
 Our Board has formed a number of committees and held certain meetings and operational review sessions designed to provide further assistance from Board members with expertise in certain areas by providing enhanced oversight over the operations of the Company. As a result, in the current operating environment, certain members of our Board, including our Chairman of the Board, are actively involved in overseeing certain key operating activities and decisions.
 The current condition of the overall labor market, including wage inflationary pressures, the challenging current operating environment and COVID-19 related factors has led to increased turnover throughout the company and challenges in meeting our staffing goals. These staffing challenges have also led to wage pressures and less than optimal staffing levels, which have impacted and could continue to impact our ability to open some of our food and beverage and retail outlets, caused us to temporarily close some rides or attractions, and/or caused longer wait times in certain areas of our parks, which has and could continue to impact the guest experience. To address these items, we continue our efforts to recruit and retain talent, optimize staffing levels and focus on park operations from the guest perspective, among other initiatives. We have also been impacted by significant inflationary pressures (particularly relating to the costs for labor, goods, freight, services and capital projects), supply chain disruptions (which has, at times, impacted ride availability) and higher interest rates. We have heightened our focus on cost reduction and efficiency opportunities as well as incremental pricing and revenue opportunities to help offset cost pressures.
For further discussion relating to strategic measures we have taken to operate in the current environment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 1–Description of the Business in the notes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For other factors concerning the current operating environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various
other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations” and “If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected”.
In March 2022, we opened our Sesame Place San Diego park which has been, and is expected to continue to be, open more operating days than the Aquatica San Diego park it replaced, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Additionally, during 2021 we began year-round operations at our SeaWorld park in Texas and began to strategically add additional operating days at both our Busch Gardens park in Virginia and our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania.
Our Competitive Strengths
•Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands, intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various consumer product offerings, including toys, books, apparel, educational tools and technology accessories as well as our websites and advertisements.
 •Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks which deliver high-quality educational experiences, entertainment offerings, aesthetic appeal, and shopping and dining experiences. Our portfolio includes theme parks ranked among the most highly attended in the industry, including three of the top 20 theme parks and four of the top 10 water parks in North America, as measured by attendance (TEA/AECOM 2019 Report). Our combined theme park portfolio has over 700 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 75 animal habitats, 133 programs and 205 rides. In addition, we have over 325 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from educational animal encounters and presentations and family-friendly attractions, to thrilling rides and exciting shows. In fact, we have won numerous awards and recognition. See further details in our theme park portfolio table located in the Our Theme Parks section which follows. 
 •Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which at times can help protect us from the impact of localized events. Many of our theme parks showcase a different mix of thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions including rides, educational presentations and/or shows. This varied portfolio of offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our portfolio of theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base.
 •One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We provide care for what we believe is one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our highly unique zoological collection and ability to present our animals in a differentiated, interactive and educational manner. Through opportunities to explore and interact with these amazing animals in our parks, each year we educate millions of guests with the goal of inspiring them to care and protect animals and their habitats in the wild. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote their health. We also lead, partner with and/or sponsor research efforts that have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help protect and sustain species in their natural habitats around the world. See the “—Conservation and Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 •Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise, and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our six decades of caring for animals, would be extremely difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “— Capital Improvements” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our new rides and attractions). We believe that the limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development in the United States coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed.
 •Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, led by Marc Swanson, our Chief Executive Officer, has an average tenure of approximately 21 years in relevant industries. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product and business development, hospitality, marketing, finance and accounting. Additionally, we believe our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making us a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care. 

•Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers and/or tourism destinations across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and vacation packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region.
 •Significant Cash Flow Generation. We believe that our disciplined approach to capital expenditures, cost management and working capital management historically has enabled us to generate significant annual operating cash flow, even in previous years of declining performance. In addition, some of our parks are open year-round, which has helped reduce seasonal cash flow volatility. Due to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating cash flow in 2020 was materially impacted, however, we have generated strong operating cash flow in both 2022 and 2021. See the seasonality discussion and the liquidity and capital resources discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 •Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are educational, fun and meaningful. Additionally, our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania was the first theme park in the world to have achieved the designation of Certified Autism Center from the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (the “IBCCES”). 
 In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided complimentary distance learning resources for students, teachers and parents to use as schools shifted to virtual classrooms. These resources included standards-aligned classroom activities, teacher’s guides, videos, and animal information books. By providing these distance learning resources, we were able to help families explore, discover, and stay connected virtually in a fun and inspiring environment even while our parks were temporarily closed. We continue to provide and update these educational resources to encourage continuous learning.
 We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are one of the primary supporters and a corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. Over our history, our animal experts have helped over 40,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned wild animals. We are committed to animal rescue, conservation research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts.
Our Theme Parks
Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased property in San Diego. Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to both thrilling and family-friendly rides, educational presentations and spectacular shows. Our theme parks also provide guests special events and concerts throughout the year, including our Seven Seas Food Festivals, Food & Wine Festivals, Craft Beer Festivals, Sesame Street Kids’ Weekends, Inside Look behind the scenes events, Viva La Musica music celebrations and Summer Nights and Electric Ocean summer events. Additionally, we feature special seasonal events such as our Halloween Spooktacular and Howl-O-Scream events and our Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa events, along with a variety of other events or festivals throughout the year for holidays such as Lunar New Year, Mardi Gras and Cinco de Mayo. Our theme parks are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. See further discussion of our recent awards and recognition in the theme park portfolio table which follows. Also see a discussion of our new rides and attractions under the Capital Improvements section.
 We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which we believe improves our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs. Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following (see the theme park portfolio table which follows for more details on each of these parks):

•SeaWorld. SeaWorld is widely recognized as the leading marine-life theme park brand in the world. Our SeaWorld theme parks rank among the most highly attended theme parks in the industry and offer up-close interactive experiences, educational presentations, special dining experiences, family-friendly and thrilling attractions and a variety of educational and entertainment offerings that immerse guests in the marine-life theme. We also offer our guests numerous animal encounters, including the opportunity to work with trainers and feed marine animals, as well as themed thrill and family-friendly rides and entertainment that creatively incorporate our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. We currently own and operate the following SeaWorld-branded theme parks:

We currently own and operate the following Busch Gardens theme parks:
 •Busch Gardens Tampa Bay is open year-round and features exotic animals, shows and both thrill and family-friendly rides on 306 acres of lush natural landscape.

Capital Improvements
 We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay.
During 2022, we opened numerous new rides and attractions including 5 of the top 10 Best New Amusement Park Attractions of 2022, led by Ice Breaker at SeaWorld Orlando which ranked #1 (USA Today, 2022). For 2023, we believe we have a strong line-up of new rides, attractions, events and upgrades, including, something new and meaningful planned in every one of our parks. This includes the following new rides and attractions expected to open in 2023:
 •Pipeline: The Surf Coaster (SeaWorld Orlando): The first-of-its-kind surf coaster, with seats in a surfing position that rise and fall to mimic the sensation of riding a wave. The coaster will accelerate riders to 60 miles per hour through five air-time moments and an innovative 'wave curl' inversion.
 •Arctic Rescue (SeaWorld San Diego): The fastest and longest straddle coaster on the West Coast takes riders through three launches at speeds up to 40 miles per hour.
 •Catapult Falls (SeaWorld San Antonio): The world's first launched flume coaster features the world's steepest flume drop, North America's only flume with a vertical lift, and the tallest flume drop in Texas.
 •DarKoaster (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): The first all-indoor straddle coaster in North America. Riders experience four launches at speeds up to 36 miles per hour through over 2,400 feet of track. 
 •Serengeti Flyer (Busch Gardens Tampa Bay): The world’s tallest and fastest Screaming Swing will take riders up 135 feet at speeds reaching 68 miles per hour.
 •Turi's Kid Cove and Tamariki Twirl (Aquatica Orlando): A water play area featuring watering palms, tipping buckets, spraying jets and water bobbles along with the Tamariki Twirl kid-sized wave slide. 
 •Shaka Laka Shores (Adventure Island): A splash and play zone featuring an area with over 25 spray elements and a central kid-friendly play structure.
 •Riptide Race (Water Country USA): The first dueling pipeline slide in Virginia that will send riders through over 500 feet of slide all while navigating high-speed tunnels and tight turns alongside their opponents.
 •Bert & Ernie's Splashy Shores (Sesame Place Philadelphia): A water play area featuring water umbrellas, tipping buckets, spraying jets, water bobbles and a spraying water tower.
 •The Count's Splash Castle (Sesame Place San Diego): An enhanced water play area and expanded play structure which features three tipping buckets, four water slides and over 100 other water play elements.
 In order to manage costs and expenditures and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of certain rides that were still under construction and originally scheduled to open in 2020. We were able to open certain new attractions in 2020 including our award-winning Texas Stingray coaster at SeaWorld San Antonio and in 2021, we opened Riptide Race at Aquatica Orlando. During 2022, we opened the remaining rides which had been previously delayed from 2020.
 Safety, Maintenance and Inspection
 Safety is of utmost importance to us. Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees.
 Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors, and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within, and that maintenance is conducted according to, the manufacturer’s criteria, internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation.
 A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials.

In addition to our day-to-day maintenance and inspection practices for the existing rides in our parks, before new rides are introduced to our guests, an extensive review of the ride, from design through installation, is conducted by the ride manufacturer, internal technical and operational experts, local authorities, as well as competent third-party inspectors and engineers. Additionally, all new rides are analyzed according to a standardized, internal evaluation and acceptance process, which reviews, among other things, that the new ride operates safely and as intended, that the associated site and facility requirements for the ride operation are met, that the appropriate training of our employees is conducted, and that operational and maintenance procedures are documented.
 Environmental and Social Responsibility
 As a purpose-driven company, our culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for our guests and, in many of our parks, inspiring our guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to social responsibility and strive to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. We create an environment in our theme parks, where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success.
 Animal Care and Rescue
We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care, while striving to provide habitats that promote the health of the animals. During our temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, essential personnel, including our animal care experts, continued to provide for the health, safety, and nutritional needs of all of the animals in our care. Our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care.
The zoological programs of all three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are validated by several professional zoological assessing organizations. Our parks are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (“AZA”), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (“AMMPA”), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (“IMATA”), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. And lastly, all three SeaWorld parks, Aquatica Orlando, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are Certified Humane by Humane Conservation, an animal welfare certification standard developed by the independent third-party organization American Humane.
 We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health and welfare of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians, and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals.
We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations, including ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies, and capabilities. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild.
We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations around the world. For example, our continued work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks has helped to establish and refine the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. This ongoing research also includes defining the basic biology and physiology of animals in our population. The combined results of these continued research efforts have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help formulate plans to protect species in their natural habitats.

We are also a leader in animal rescue. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our rescue teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, including during our temporary park closures in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with our mission to protect animals and their ecosystems, our rescue teams mobilize and often travel hundreds of miles to help ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned wild animals in need of our expert care, with the goal of returning then to their natural habitat. Over our history, we have helped over 40,000 animals across a number of species including bottlenose dolphins, manatees, sea lions, seals, sea turtles, sharks, birds and more. For example, we work closely with Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (the “FWC”) and in the past six years have helped over 300 manatees as human caused pressures increase. We have one of the largest manatee rescue operations in the world and operate one of only five manatee critical care facilities in the U.S. In response to the growing number of manatees in crisis, during 2022 we announced plans to double the size of our manatee rescue facility at SeaWorld Orlando.
 Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “—Conservation and Community Relations” section which follows.
 Conservation and Community Relations
 Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits, “Inside Look” events, educational presentations, and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places. We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. For example, we are working alongside various resource management agencies, including the FWC, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the Fish and Wildlife Foundation of Florida, and other zoological facilities, to save Florida's endangered coral reef by contributing resources and expertise to the Florida Coral Rescue Center (the “FCRC”). The FCRC is an environmental conservation effort located in Orlando, Florida that aims to provide a safe and stable home for coral colonies to receive world-class care from a team of experts, including experts from SeaWorld. The FCRC was established for gene banking and care of corals rescued from reefs not yet affected by disease impacting corals in the wild.
 We have supported conservation efforts such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationist Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started nearly 60 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific research organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet.
 As part of our commitment to education and conservation efforts, we have entered into partnerships on some of our rides and attractions including with the following conservation organizations: the Alaska SeaLife Center on our Ice Breaker at SeaWorld Orlando ride which highlights animal rescue and climate change in the Arctic region; Penguins International on our Emperor ride at SeaWorld San Diego which focuses on penguin awareness and conservation; and the Wilderness Foundation Africa on our Iron Gwazi ride at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay which highlights the plight of endangered African wildlife.
 Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Additionally, our ambassadors are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts, fun run charity fundraisers, local food bank distributions and more. We also provide complimentary tickets and discounts to educators as well as active and former military and their families.
Sustainable Operations
Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate.
Energy Efficiency
We are evaluating the ways in which we can reduce our fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to better align with our mission to protect animals and the natural ecosystems on which they rely. Over the past few years, we have continued to make investments in renewable energy and greater energy efficiency at our parks and buildings such as solar panels, LED lighting retrofits, adding variable-frequency drive to motors and enhancing other mechanical systems. Renewable and energy efficiency highlights include the solar carport system at Sesame Place San Diego, which not only generates up to 90% of the park’s annual energy needs but also provides over 400 shaded parking spots for guests and employees. In our data operations, we have adopted processes that decrease energy usage at on-premise data centers, including transitioning gradually to cloud storage. In addition to lowering our overall electrical consumption, these measures are designed to improve our data security posture.
Water Stewardship
 Given our dedication to protecting marine animals and their habitats, water stewardship is naturally one of our key focus areas. Our parks and operations rely heavily upon water, and we continually seek innovative ways of reducing water usage, whether through updating our parks’ animal habitats with new filtration technology strategies, using best practices wherever possible, or installing drought-tolerant landscaping. We believe our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks, including a natural biofiltration system in 2019 at SeaWorld San Antonio, which is the first of its kind in a zoological setting. Many of our water conservation efforts incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings, and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere.
Waste Management
 We see the impacts of marine debris and litter along shorelines and in coastal waters, estuaries, and oceans – a visible reminder of the need to reduce waste. We are doing our part by implementing programs to generate less waste in our parks. At all our parks, we have implemented a range of waste-reduction and resource conservation initiatives, including: (i) removing all expanded polystyrene products from the parks; (ii) removing all plastic straws, plastic coffee stir sticks and plastic shopping bags as of 2018; (iii) using fibers certified by the Forest Stewardship Counsel (“FSC”) as sustainably sourced for printed materials when available; and (iv) minimizing the use of paper throughout our business by switching to online platforms and providing tablets for Environmental Health & Safety employees to use for accident investigation. We raise awareness with our employees and guests about the need for all of us to do our part to address this global challenge.
Responsible Sourcing
 Corporate responsibility extends to how we source the goods and services needed to operate our parks and to serve our guests. We have established a Responsible Food Sourcing Policy, which outlines our commitment to partner with food suppliers that deliver products that meet or exceed sustainable, healthy and humane food standards. For example, our seafood is sourced from organizations that promote environmentally responsible fishing and farming processing and food safety practices, our eggs are certified cage-free, and we have made a commitment to purchase commodity pork cuts from suppliers who have announced a commitment to humane farming practices. In response to growing guest demand, we have also taken steps to expand the number of plant-based food offerings on our menus across our parks. As part of these efforts, in 2019, we added a sustainable, plant-based burger to our menus at all of our parks. We have also taken additional steps, where possible, to identify and partner with brands and products in our parks which share our commitment to giving back to communities, animals, and/or our broader environment.
Human Capital Management
We have a diverse and mission-driven team of employee ambassadors. Our team makes it possible each day to provide our guests with experiences that matter and to inspire them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,200 full-time employees and approximately 11,900 part-time and seasonal employees. During our peak operating season in 2022, we employed additional part-time and seasonal employees, including high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Our focus on recruiting and developing diverse talent has resulted in a management team that is approximately 48% female and 34% of a minority ethnicity. Similarly, our overall workforce is 51% women and 56% of a minority ethnicity. We don’t simply view diversity as a target, but rather a continual commitment to focus on creating the best and most inclusive workplace possible by recognizing and celebrating our unique backgrounds.
We strive to provide our ambassadors with a competitive compensation package using market data including comprehensive benefits. We provide benefits including health, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, retirement, paid time-off, complimentary tickets and various other benefits.
We provide training and require certifications for certain positions. We routinely review all procedures and safety requirements to promote a safe working environment for our ambassadors, guests and animals.
 We believe that working for our Company is more than a job – it is a commitment to the protection of animals and the wild wonders of our world, while also providing a fun and meaningful experience for our guests that will be remembered long after they leave our parks. We create memories that matter. Our human capital programs, policies, and initiatives will continue to reinforce this belief in the years ahead.
Our Products and Services
 Admission Tickets
 We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry.
Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season or annual passes. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours and educational animal encounters, specialty dining packages, and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience.
 We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. We utilize demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at some of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods.
In-Park Offerings
We generate revenue from the sale of in-park products and services, primarily consisting of food, beverage and merchandise items.
Food and Beverage Offerings
We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable food and beverage experiences for our guests. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base. We also offer a variety of dining programs that we believe provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price for the entirety of their day visit to the park. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal, and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through our ongoing culinary supply chain management initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions.
Merchandise and Other In-Park Service Offerings
 We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends, and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings. In-park games are designed with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age. Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient, and comfortable. This includes offering quick queue passes for front of the line access to popular attractions, reserved seating, cabana rentals and other guest conveniences like lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs.
Consumer Products and Licensing
 To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through licensing and consumer product arrangements. We developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a significant percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty. In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street and Build-A-Bear. We have also incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC, which currently runs through January 2024.
Group Events
 At times we host a variety of different group events and meetings at our theme parks, both during the day and at night. Our parks provide a wide variety of unique venues, backdrops and products for groups and include venues such as the icy walls of Antarctica, concert ready stadiums, outdoor pavilions, animal habitats and fully air-conditioned ballrooms. Our special group ticket packages and offerings appeal to specialty markets such as youth, sports, social (e.g., family reunions) and fraternal groups, as well as corporate groups seeking to recognize and reward their employees.
Park buy-outs have historically allowed groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings, educational presentations and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind-the-scenes tours. Our group facilities are available year-round and fully customizable as they can be built around any of the park’s special events, educational presentations, inspirational shows, or one-of-a-kind attractions. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility that includes a ballroom, a collection of four outdoor pavilions and a courtyard in Orlando, or a fully enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion in Tampa.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts, group events and/or attendance in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were impacted. See the “—Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Risk Factors” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance.
Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances
We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value, and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities. Some of our corporate sponsors, such as our partners at Coca-Cola, also join us in making an impact on conservation efforts through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Also see additional discussion concerning our conservation partnerships, such as Guy Harvey, in the “—Conservation and Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
 See the seasonality discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Markets, Guests and Customers
Our theme parks are entertainment venues with broad demographic appeal and are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, including 6 of the 10 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States and 7 of the top 25 Popular Destinations in the United States (U.S. Census, 2022; TripAdvisor, 2022). Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, historically our guests have included local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international visitors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts, travel from domestic and/or international markets were impacted in 2020, 2021 and 2022. See the “—Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Risk Factors” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license.
 The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC.
 Sesame License Agreement
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with a second Sesame Place® theme park which opened in 2022. We opened our second Sesame Place theme park at the site of the former Aquatica San Diego in March 2022. We also have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory.
 Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States, including Sesame Place San Diego (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street® Land at SeaWorld Orlando, which opened in spring of 2019, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street-themed attractions.
In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States.
The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “Sesame Street” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “Sesame Street” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “Sesame Place” and “Sesame Land,” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.”
Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays specified annual license fees, as well as a schedule of royalties based on revenues earned in connection with admissions, sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event.
International Development Strategy
We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We continue to make progress in our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”). As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. We also receive additional funds from our partner related to certain agreed-upon services and reimbursements of costs incurred by us on behalf of the Middle East Project. The Middle East Project is on track with the park expected to open in 2023. Additionally, we continue to evaluate and assess other international opportunities which we
believe could provide additional value. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives.”
Our Industry
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the theme park industry causing complete shutdowns or extended periods of closure. Some theme parks chose to partially reopen with capacity limitations and enhanced safety protocols, which allowed them to resume operations but with lower levels of attendance. With the widespread introduction and reception of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in 2021, and further in 2022, the operating environment and attendance levels have generally improved; however, COVID-19 related factors have and could continue to impact domestic and international travel, group-related attendance and events, public opinion concerning social gatherings and consumer behavior. We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that over the long-term generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions.
Competition
 Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies.
 Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), availability and cost of transportation to a theme park, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety.
We believe we can compete effectively due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, diversity of product offerings and locations, targeted capital investments, guest sentiment related to our rescue and conservation efforts, and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment.
Regulatory
 Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future.
Recent Regulatory Developments
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”). The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016. We submitted a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. These Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as a priority for APHIS with the release in January 2023 of the Department of Agriculture’s latest Semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions for Fall 2022 (the “Fall 2022 Unified Agenda”) indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter. However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future.
 APHIS did include in the Fall 2022 Unified Agenda a notice that it planned to issue a Final Rulemaking in the first quarter of 2023 to extend its enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act to birds, other than birds bred for use in research. APHIS says this would help ensure the humane care and treatment of such birds. The final APHIS regulations were published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2023. These regulations are not expected to materially impact our park’s avian operations.
 On December 3, 2021, APHIS released a Final Rule related to contingency plans for the handling of animals. This rulemaking, which became effective on January 3, 2022, amends Animal Welfare Act regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. APHIS says this action will heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur.
Effective on August 1, 2022, APHIS instituted new procedures for its Animal Welfare Act inspection of animal care facilities. During these inspections, APHIS animal care officials ("Animal Care Officials") identify and document any instances of non-compliance or violations of the Animal Welfare Act. Prior to August 1, 2022, Animal Care Officials would document minor instances of non-compliance on a separate form and use them as “teachable moments.” Licensees that had multiple or serious instances of non-compliance were not eligible for teachable moments. At the direction of Congress, beginning on August 1, 2022, APHIS' use of teachable moments ended and instead they will be cited in inspection reports with any other non-compliance issues.
 On October 26, 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS) published a notice in the Federal Register to change the status of the emperor penguin to a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. SeaWorld is the only U.S. facility that houses this flightless bird species from Antarctica. This rule adds the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. At the same time, USFWS also finalized a rule issued under the authority of section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of this species. The rule, which became effective on November 25, 2022, among other things prohibits the transport or breeding of Emperor Penguins. We do not expect the rule to have a material impact to the Company.
 On January 6, 2023, APHIS published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("ANPR") pertaining to amendments to Wild and Exotic Animal Handling, Enrichment and Training Regulations. APHIS requested public comment on its plans to propose amendments to enhance regulations and standards for animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act in three areas: (i) public handling of wild and exotic animals at licensed exhibitors, (ii) the training of personnel who handle wild and exotic animals in these settings, and (iii) environmental enrichment to promote the psychological well-being of all species covered under the Animal Welfare Act. Comments must be received by April 10, 2023 and SeaWorld intends to submit a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on this ANPR.
On July 26, 2022, U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the Strengthening Welfare in Marine Settings Act of 2022 ("SWIMS Act"). This bill would establish prohibitions on capturing, importing, exporting, or breeding of orcas, beluga whales, false killer whales, or pilot whales for the purpose of public display. The bill would prohibit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from issuing any permit under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 that authorizes the taking (e.g., capturing) or importation of such orcas or whales for the purpose of public display. The bill would revise the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to make it unlawful to export such orcas or whales, unless they are being transported to marine mammal sanctuaries or for release into the wild. Further, the bill would make it unlawful under the Animal Welfare Act for any person to breed or artificially inseminate such marine mammals for purposes of using their progeny for public display. The bill was referred to the House Agriculture Committee and House Natural Resources Committee. On August 2, 2022, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced an identical version of the SWIMS Act in the U.S. Senate. The bill was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. No hearings or consideration of the bill was scheduled in the House or Senate before the 117th Congress adjourned on January 3, 2023. To date, the bill has not been reintroduced in the 118th Congress.
 For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts.”

We face a rapidly changing regulatory environment across our business, including responses to COVID-19, wages and hour regulations, employee health and benefit requirement and the policy agenda of the U.S. President and his administration to name a few. For more detailed discussion, see the “Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” section and the following under the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations; and The policies of the U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.”
 Insurance
 We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $100.0 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures consistent with our normal expected losses related to general liability claims, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage which we believe is appropriate for our business. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions or co-insurance we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available, the availability of coverage for special or specific risks or whether the amount of insurance will be sufficient to cover all actual perils that may occur. For example, our losses in 2020 related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were not covered by insurance available to us.
Corporate History
 Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states. On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World, Inc.) and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a Busch Entertainment Corporation) from certain subsidiaries of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. We refer to this acquisition and related financing transactions as the “2009 Transactions.” SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009 in connection with the 2009 Transactions and changed its name from SW Holdco, Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in December 2012. We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in April 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SEAS”.
On May 8, 2017, an affiliate of ZHG Group, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD. (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and the Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). ZHG pledged such shares in connection with certain loan obligations of ZHG (the “Pledged Shares”). ZHG subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain lenders (the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares and, accordingly, the Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with us pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent (the “SEAS Repurchase”). On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent. The purchase closed on May 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2022, Hill Path owned approximately 42.6% of our total outstanding common stock.
