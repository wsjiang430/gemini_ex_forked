ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are a leading global provider of cloud-based software solutions for managed service providers (“MSPs”), enabling them to support digital transformation and growth for small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”), which we define as those enterprises having less than 1,000 employees. With a flexible technology platform and powerful integrations, N-able makes it easy for MSPs to monitor, manage, and protect their end-customer systems, data, and networks. Our growing portfolio of management, security, automation, and data protection solutions is built for IT services management professionals. N-able simplifies complex ecosystems and enables customers to solve their most pressing challenges. In addition, we provide extensive, proactive support—through enriching partner programs, hands-on training, and growth resources—to help MSPs deliver exceptional value and achieve success at scale. Through our multi-dimensional land and expand model and global presence, we are able to drive strong recurring revenue growth and profitability.
Organizations of all sizes are deploying technology to transform their businesses and compete effectively. As SMEs go through digital transformation, their reliance on technology as a competitive differentiator increases. IT environments are becoming increasingly complex, with the number of applications and endpoints proliferating while also becoming more interconnected, causing the sophistication and overhead required to deploy, manage and secure these assets to grow. 
Many SMEs lack the resources or internal expertise to effectively manage their IT assets and adapt to the changing environment. This lack of resources and expertise coupled with the desire to better leverage technology in their businesses has created a growing need for SMEs to rely on MSPs for their IT deployment, management, security, and data protection. MSPs become vital partners as more SMEs seek to implement technology solutions that help drive strategic business outcomes. 
To effectively manage the operability and security of distributed and heterogeneous IT environments, MSPs require visibility and control over a variety of architectures, applications and connected endpoints. MSPs must also keep pace with rapid technological innovation or risk obsolescence. These challenges are made more difficult when the solutions upon which MSPs rely lack integration capabilities or otherwise fail to meet the technological and business needs of the MSPs and their customers.
We enable IT service providers of all types to act as MSPs by providing a platform that they can leverage to help SMEs access powerful and seamless technology to power their businesses. Our software platform is designed to be an integrated, enterprise-grade solution that serves as an operating system for our MSP partners and scales as their businesses grow. Built on a multi-tier, multi-tenant architecture, our platform allows our MSP partners to adapt to their customers’ requirements and improve service delivery by offering centralized visibility and role-based access control in both public and private cloud, on-premises and hybrid cloud environments.
Our platform consists of three core solution categories: remote monitoring and management, security solutions, and data protection as-a-service. Our broad remote monitoring and management capabilities include real-time availability and performance of networks and devices and automation of policies and workflows. We provide a layered security approach spanning network and systems infrastructure, applications, and end user devices through our data protection, patch management, endpoint security, web protection, e-mail security and archiving and vulnerability assessment solutions. Our fully cloud-based data protection as-a-service capabilities include storage efficient backup, high-speed restoration and disaster recovery for servers, workstations, files, data and key cloud-based applications. In addition to our core solution categories, our business management solutions help improve the technical and service delivery efficiencies of our MSP partners and include professional services automation and password and documentation management. 
We have a multi-dimensional land and expand model and global presence that allow us to capture opportunities efficiently within the worldwide MSP and SME markets. When we add an MSP partner, we also add their SME customers and we grow as the partner adds new customers, delivers new services based on our solutions and when the partner’s customers add devices and services. We support our MSP partners by offering partner success strategies designed to help them better manage their own businesses, deliver service offerings powered by our platform and grow their customer bases. These partner success strategies help drive both retention and expansion as the resources we provide are designed to help MSPs better assess and pursue growth opportunities. 
Our business model allows us to grow with our MSP partners. MSP partners with annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, over $50,000 on our platform grew from 1,678 as of December 31, 2021 to 1,898 as of December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 13.1%. Over the same period, MSP partners with over $50,000 of ARR on our platform grew from approximately 47% of our total ARR as of December 31, 2021 to approximately 51% of our total ARR as of December 31, 2022. 
Our business is global, with 51.3%, 53.6% and 52.2% of our revenue generated outside of the United States for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generated revenue of $371.8 million, $346.5 million and $302.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing an increase of 14.4% from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021 and an increase of 7.3% from the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 our net income (loss) was $16.7 million, $0.1 million and $(7.2) million, respectively, and our adjusted EBITDA was $114.7 million, $113.3 million and $120.6 million, respectively.
Industry Background
Companies of all sizes across sectors and geographies continue to invest in modern cloud and digital technology to transform their organizations and compete effectively. Technology is becoming increasingly mission critical as SMEs use digital means to improve productivity, work remotely, manage and monitor their businesses, run operations and engage with customers and other key stakeholders. As evidence of the importance of technology to SMEs, IT spending by businesses with less than 1,000 employees is expected to increase from $1.3 trillion in 2022 to $1.8 trillion by 2026 according to Gartner.
Digital transformation creates challenges and complexities
As SMEs increase their investment in and reliance on these technologies, the importance of IT availability and functionality to their businesses grows. Selecting, purchasing and implementing new technology infrastructures and deploying new applications and devices can be complex and create financial, personnel and other challenges for SMEs. Many SMEs lack the financial resources, headcount and expertise needed to independently manage the complexity associated with digital transformation and therefore rely on MSPs that specialize in providing SMEs with reliable and scalable services to deploy, manage and secure their IT environments. Challenges associated with digital transformation for SMEs include:
1)IT management and security are not core competencies for most companies. 
Deploying, managing and securing complex and constantly evolving IT systems are not core competencies of most SMEs and can divert focus, capital and other critical resources away from fundamental business objectives. Modern infrastructures, applications and devices require teams with expertise across a variety of technical disciplines such as security, database administration, IT, development operations and network administration. Despite being increasingly dependent on technology solutions, many SMEs lack the requisite time, resources and expertise. 
2)Companies face growing cyber-threats.
Protecting networks, applications, devices, data and users from cybercrime, such as ransomware, phishing and other costly attacks is paramount for SMEs. Security issues can create significant legal complications, be financially crippling and damage an SME’s brand and reputation.
3)IT and other compliance costs and burdens are increasing.
SMEs are not exempt from compliance obligations and can be disproportionately burdened due to limited resources and expertise. Laws, regulations, rules and standards governing IT, privacy, security, personnel and industries are complex, constantly changing and varied across geographies and sectors, with many obligations carrying criminal penalties for non-compliance. 
4)Proliferation of connected endpoints is driving increased complexity.
Due to the growing number of networked, highly distributed and diverse endpoints, the burden faced by SMEs to manage, provision and secure these endpoints across cloud, on-premises and hybrid cloud infrastructures is becoming increasingly complex. 
5)Expectations for always-on, always-available IT environments compound pressures. 
Customers, employees and other stakeholders increasingly expect always-on, always-available access to digital resources. Establishing and maintaining connectivity and availability is critical to the success of many SMEs, who must ensure that their employees and distributed workforces have access to required systems, applications and devices and that their customers can obtain information and conduct business online at any time.
Rise of the Managed IT Services Model
As SMEs invest in technology and their needs for continuous availability, performance and security grow, they are increasingly relying on IT service providers to manage these aspects of their businesses. These MSPs support SMEs by helping them procure and deploy key technologies and by providing oversight, management and security of their IT systems and devices. Rather than charging their customers by the task, MSPs typically have recurring annual or monthly contracts to deliver 
these on-going services. MSPs also may work in collaboration with SMEs’ internal IT departments in a co-managed model to deliver specific expertise and share responsibilities. 
We see a growing number of IT service providers, such as value-added resellers, systems integrators, IT consultants and data center operators, adopting a managed services model as demand for these services increases. These new MSPs can benefit from a software platform that supports the managed services model and meets the wide-ranging needs of their SME customers. For example, SMEs with less complex IT requirements might need remote monitoring and management, endpoint protection and backup and disaster recovery. Other SMEs may have more complex IT requirements and look to their MSP to provide help desk capabilities, network operations management, or security operations. 
Market Opportunity
Our cloud-based software solutions enable MSPs to support their SME customers’ growth and digital transformation. These MSP partners rely on our platform to deploy, manage and secure the IT environments of over 500,000 SMEs around the world. Technology is becoming increasingly mission critical for SMEs as a means to improve productivity, work remotely, manage, and monitor their businesses, run operations and engage with customers and other key stakeholders. In the Forecast Analysis: Small and Midsize Business IT Spending, Worldwide report published for the fourth quarter of 2022, Gartner estimated that IT spending by SMEs with less than 1,000 employees is expected to increase from $1.3 trillion in 2022 to $1.8 trillion by 2026. 
In 2021, we commissioned Frost & Sullivan to conduct an independent analysis to assess the global addressable market for our remote monitoring and management, security and data protection and business management solutions. To determine our addressable market, Frost & Sullivan calculated the sum of: 1) the estimate of MSP’s average revenue per SME customer for remote monitoring, security and data protection solutions multiplied by their estimate of the total number of SMEs serviced by MSPs; and 2) the estimate of the average cost for business management solutions used by MSPs multiplied by the estimate of the total number of addressable MSPs. 
According to this analysis, the global market opportunity for our solutions was estimated to be approximately $23.3 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 13.5% to approximately $43.9 billion by 2025. We believe that the size and projected growth of the global market for our solutions represents a significant opportunity for our business.
Limitations of Existing Approaches Used by MSPs 
MSPs are better able to serve their customers and manage disparate, heterogeneous IT environments with technologies that are centralized, effective, easy to deploy, scalable and able to integrate with other solutions. 
Many existing approaches utilized by MSPs face limitations, such as: 
1)Not purpose-built for MSPs. Many tools are not designed to power a managed services model, as they fail to enable MSPs to deliver services in a scalable and efficient manner. These tools can lead to issues around deployment, configurability or scalability. Additionally, some tools may require upfront hardware purchases or lack native or hybrid cloud management and data protection capabilities. These tools can also make it more difficult to manage disparate or heterogeneous environments through a single control panel. 
2)Narrow point solutions and tools with limited flexibility and integrations. Many MSP-oriented offerings fail to provide a comprehensive set of solutions on a common platform. Without a unified platform, MSPs are required to utilize disparate solutions and tools which can limit their ability to manage their own and their customers’ IT environments in a centralized, coordinated manner. Many of these solutions and tools have narrow functionality and are not designed to integrate with other technologies. This can lead to a lack of interoperability that prevents MSPs from having a unified view of their customers’ IT environments.
3)Lacking enterprise-grade features and functionality. Many approaches targeting the MSP and SME markets offer limited functionality or lack the features and capabilities needed by businesses of all sizes to be competitive in the digital world. As SMEs shift towards always-on, always-available digital environments across more aspects of their businesses, these approaches can lack the depth of functionality required to adequately serve their needs. In addition, providers of these tools may lack the ability to adapt and innovate rapidly to respond to the changing technology needs of MSPs and SMEs.
4)Not partner success oriented. Providers of alternative approaches can lack MSP-oriented domain expertise and partner success functions designed to help MSPs grow their businesses. This can make it more difficult for MSPs to use and deploy tools to their full potential and effectively serve their customers.
5)Pricing and deployment limitations. Many tools lack flexible pricing models and deployment options that are aligned with the way MSPs sell and deliver their services. This can lead to business challenges and inefficiencies for MSPs, which can give rise to inflexible service offerings to their customers.
6)Manual and inefficient. Alternative approaches can lack automation, requiring MSPs to manually address issues that they or their customers face. This need for manual intervention can drive higher headcount costs and cause slower resolution times. Alternative tools may also lack reporting and analytics that help MSPs proactively identify and remediate issues before they arise.

We grow with our MSP partners as they expand their customer bases, deliver new services powered by our solutions and when their customers add devices and services. Our partner success strategies further enhance our model’s efficiency by empowering our MSP partners to grow their businesses and expand their customer bases and consumption of solutions on our platform.
To add new MSP partners, we employ an efficient low-touch, high-velocity “selling from the inside” motion. Our sales motion is rooted in selling online or over the phone to MSPs of all sizes across any location through a prescriptive approach that adheres to standardized pricing and agreements. We power this sales motion with a marketing model that is highly flexible, analytics-driven and designed to efficiently drive digital traffic and high-quality opportunities. Our low-friction sales motion and marketing model also allow prospective MSP partners to trial fully functional versions of the solutions on our platform, which is frequently a step to broader adoption. Internationally, we augment our go-to-market approach with a targeted and localized distributor model.
We believe our differentiated go-to-market approach benefits our business for a number of reasons, including:
1)Sales reach extension. Our MSP partners effectively extend our sales reach into the worldwide SME market. When we acquire a new MSP partner, we also add its SME customers and continue to benefit as the MSP partner expands its customer base.
2)Sales expansion through natural adoption. MSP partners expand usage of our offerings over time when they add new customers and when their customers add new devices and services. As digital transformation trends continue to impact SMEs, our platform facilitates the delivery of new and enhanced services by our MSP partners to their customers.
3)Capital efficient scaling. We gain significant operating leverage through our MSP partners’ customer acquisition efforts and the support and overhead they provide to service their customers. 
4)Loyalty and retention. Our best-in-class partner success strategies drive loyalty and retention by providing our MSP partners with resources designed to help them better understand and pursue growth opportunities using our platform.
5)Strong international presence. Our extensive international distributor network and localized go-to-market approach has enabled and enhanced our robust global presence.
Growth Strategy 
We believe there are significant growth opportunities in our market, and we intend to focus our investments to capitalize on these opportunities and accelerate revenue growth. We believe that our growth will come from the following vectors: 
1)Expand our MSP partner footprint. Our partner acquisition model is driven by us adding new MSP partners that develop and deliver services powered by our platform to their SME customers. We focus on adding MSP partners that have the opportunity to grow their businesses alongside us and increase consumption of solutions on our platform. 
2)Facilitate partner-enabled growth. When we add an MSP partner, we expand our relationship with the partner through two vectors. We grow when our MSP partners expand their SME customer base. We also grow when our MSP partners deliver new or enhanced services to their customers based on our solutions and when their customers add devices and services. As digital transformation initiatives at SMEs are pushing them to modernize their IT systems, we are seeing tailwinds in the adoption and usage of our solutions by SME customers through our MSP partners. We utilize numerous partner success strategies to help our MSP partners expand their customer bases by educating them on how to introduce deeper and broader sets of service offerings. In this manner, our MSP partners serve as an extension of our sales footprint while requiring minimal incremental sales efforts by us. Our ability to expand within our partner base is demonstrated by our dollar-based net revenue retention rate, which was 103%, 110% and 109% for each of the trailing twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
3)Widen our surface area. We also grow by expanding the aperture of networks, devices, services and users that we manage and secure on our platform. This surface area expansion is driven by internal development, strategic technology partnerships with large enterprise technology vendors and integrations with other MSP technology providers.
4)Drive innovation. We intend to continue introducing new enterprise-grade solutions on our platform. These new solutions may come from internal innovation, strategic technology partnerships or targeted acquisitions. In particular, we aim to further broaden our security service offerings, technical controls, automation and reporting and analytics capabilities. To keep pace with technological developments and ever-changing IT complexity, we also continually invest in our platform and its existing solutions.
5)Broaden our co-managed IT footprint. In addition to providing services for SMEs, some MSP partners service larger enterprises through a co-managed IT model, sharing responsibility for IT management and services with an internal IT team. We believe that increased adoption of co-managed IT models will continue to be a meaningful driver of market expansion.
6)Deliver globally. We are a global software company, generating approximately 51.3%, 53.6% and 52.2% of our total revenue from outside of the United States in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We intend to target markets around the world where we have an established presence and distribution channels and further expand to new markets through channel and personnel growth and market-specific solutions.

Our multi-tier, multi-tenant architecture also enables our global distributors to effectively deliver our solutions to a broad set of customers from a single instance of our platform.
Automation. Our platform features over 100 out-of-the-box policies to automate common tasks and for resolution of frequently occurring issues, enabling our MSP partners to focus on higher value activities. Our no code visual workflow builder and over 600 design elements make it possible for technical and non-technical personnel at our MSP partners to create and customize powerful automated processes for both proactive and reactive workflows. Our MSP partners can easily manage automation policies and track change configurations via detailed reporting within our platform.
Unified agent management. MSPs utilize software agents to collect data and facilitate connections to their customers’ endpoints. It can be time-consuming and burdensome to deploy and update these agents, particularly in a distributed or mobile workforce. We have a unified agent management system that helps our MSP partners deploy agent capabilities and update new features across multiple customer environments. Our approach to agent management is designed to make deploying new software and services fast and easy for our MSP partners. 
Security. We have invested heavily to ensure that we are building solutions in a secure manner. Our Secure Software Development Lifecycle is a continuously improving process. We regularly conduct penetration tests on our solutions with third parties and work with customers who conduct them as part of their evaluation cycles. As a part of our rigorous security procedures, we continuously evaluate our solutions with dynamic and static analysis tools and address material identified vulnerability issues. All of this is augmented by a formal Incident Response procedure to help ensure incoming incidents are appropriately triaged, escalated and remediated or mitigated. Certain of our solutions or data centers meet one or more of the following security compliance standards, which vary by product or location: HIPAA, ISO 27001, ISO 9001, NIST 800-53, PCI DSS, SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II.
Common user interface and user experience model. Our platform has been purpose-built to provide a consistent, intuitive and easy to use experience for our MSP partners. We are constantly improving the ease with which our MSP partners can engage with our platform to ensure they can efficiently deploy our solutions and accomplish their business goals. 
Global footprint. We operate a global, multi-cloud architecture in order to deliver the best customer experience across both speed and customer choice regarding data sovereignty. We operate our workloads out of a mix of private data centers, AWS and Azure. This global reach enables us to deliver extensive choice to partners who have various data storage requirements.
Strategic Technology Partnerships
We designed our platform and solutions to be highly extensible which has allowed us to develop a vast technology partner ecosystem. We have three ways to deliver solutions from our strategic technology partners to our MSP partners: 
Technology Alliance Program. Through our Technology Alliance Program, we enable third-party technology or software vendors to integrate with our platform to streamline workflows and share data. When a vendor joins the program, the relationship is formalized via a marketing agreement which sets expectations for joint marketing efforts such as webinars for our MSP partners. Once accepted to the program, these strategic partners have access to integration resources such as API documentation, as well as support and guidance from our product management team.
Integrated solution partnerships. These strategic partnerships allow us to embed best-of-breed third-party offerings directly into our platform and enable our MSP partners to sell these solutions to their customers. Through our integrated solution partnerships, we manage joint roadmap integration, full go-to-market launch, and commercialization, thereby providing a greater breadth of offerings to address the various needs of our MSP partners.
Large enterprise technology vendors. We have partnerships with large enterprise technology vendors, which we believe validates our strategic differentiation in the MSP market. Through these strategic partnerships and our multi-tier, multi-tenant architecture, we are able to offer our MSP partners a unified platform that includes offerings from these vendors such as integration with Microsoft Intune, deep support for Mac, and robust monitoring for cloud services such as Meraki. These strategic partnerships expand the surface area of the devices that our MSP partners can manage and secure.
Our MSP Partners
We are a leading global provider of software solutions for MSPs, enabling them to power digital transformation and growth within SMEs. These MSP partners deploy, manage, and secure the IT environments of their SME customers around the world. Our MSP partners purchase our solutions on a subscription basis to power managed services sold to their customers or for their own internal business management. 
Our MSP partners range in scale from IT firms with one or two technicians to large IT service providers with thousands of employees. They also range in geographical distribution, including some focused on local or regional customers and others with multi-national presences. Some of our MSP partners deploy multiple solutions on our platform across their entire customer base while others use our platform to service only a portion of their customers. Our MSP partners’ customers generally have fewer than 1,000 employees and span a wide range of industry verticals, including financial services, healthcare, professional services, education and manufacturing.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 25,000 customers. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had 1,898 MSP partners with ARR over $50,000 on our platform, up from 1,678 as of December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 13.1%. Over the same period, MSP partners with over $50,000 of ARR on our platform grew from approximately 47% of our total ARR as of December 31, 2021 to approximately 51% of our total ARR as of December 31, 2022. We determine ARR as the annualized recurring revenue as of the last month of a given period. We calculate ARR by multiplying the recurring revenue and related usage revenue, excluding the impacts of credits and reserves, recognized during the final month of the reporting period from both long-term and month-to-month subscriptions by twelve. We use ARR, and in particular, ARR attributable to MSP partners with over $50,000 of ARR, to enhance the understanding of our business performance and the growth of our relationships with our MSP partners. 
Marketing, Sales, Partner Success and Support
Our marketing, sales and partner success organizations serve as the engine that powers our multi-dimensional land and expand go-to-market strategy. Through a combination of leading targeted marketing content, free trials and business development efforts, we cultivate a high volume of qualified opportunities that are passed on to dedicated insides sales teams to convert into partners. Additionally, our inside sales team leverages our marketing content to generate their own qualified opportunities to increase product penetration into our existing base. 
We segment our sales and marketing strategies by the needs of prospective MSPs and existing partners based on the stage of their respective business lifecycle. After we add an MSP partner, our partner success program is designed to help them better manage their own businesses, offer services enabled by our platform and expand their customer bases and usage of our solutions.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts are grounded in deep industry expertise and are designed to generate high quality opportunities for our sales organization. We deploy a highly flexible and analytics-driven direct marketing approach through broad use of digital marketing techniques including search engine optimization, paid search, social media marketing, virtual events, targeted email campaigns, localized websites, free resources and content marketing, display advertising, affinity groups and webinars.
We target our marketing efforts through a segment specific approach. For potential MSP partners that have less complex IT needs, we typically deploy a low-cost, low-touch strategy. For potential MSP partners that have more complex IT needs, we leverage a cost-efficient, account-based marketing model to target and educate them. Internationally, we partner with our global network of distributors to drive a localized marketing strategy.
In addition, we engage existing and prospective MSP partners through ongoing partner success and community-based initiatives. As part of our partner success strategies, our marketing efforts are designed to educate MSPs about the features of both the service offerings that they currently use and service offerings that they do not use, as well as how our solutions can help them grow their businesses. Leveraging our deep industry expertise, we provide a range of community-based resources for 
our MSP partners including peer-to-peer webinars, online and in-person events, and content resources that are designed to help them better realize the value of our platform.
Sales
We deploy a highly effective and disciplined approach to sales that has foundations in the “selling from the inside” culture we cultivated prior to becoming a standalone company. This approach is rooted in having our sales organization selling online or over the phone, using a structured approach to managing opportunities, and adhering to standardized pricing and contract terms. Our sales team handles MSP partner accounts of all sizes and across geographies through our selling from the inside approach. 
Our sales organization is organized by our key solution categories as well as by geographic region. Our dedicated sales teams receive high-quality opportunities from our marketing and business development motions to engage with prospects, supporting our multi-dimensional land motion. This is further powered by our low-friction, free-trial approach that allows prospective MSP partners to trial a fully functional version of our platform. When these prospective partners realize the value of our platform, they can then purchase solutions on our platform at the size and level of functionality appropriate for their and their customers’ IT environments.
Furthermore, our combined efforts across marketing, partner success and sales motions drive high-quality opportunities from our existing customer base that advances our expand go-to-market strategy. This approach allows us to cross-sell and expand product penetration within our existing MSP partner base. We adhere to a disciplined, data-driven approach to converting opportunities quickly and efficiently based on our understanding of the prospect or existing partner’s specific product demands and the inflection points in the selling process.
We also sell our software through distributors to supplement our direct sales force, primarily in non-English speaking regions, as well as to initiate and fulfill sales orders from MSPs that prefer to make purchases through a specific distributor. Our localized channel strategy in international markets allows us to offer in-market solutions, sales, marketing and support in the local language. Our base of channel distributors proactively create demand for our solutions and bring new opportunities and MSPs to us. We are also able to flexibly deploy a hybrid approach in which our sales specialists work alongside our distributors when targeting and landing higher value transactions within these local markets. 
Partner Success
We provide numerous partner success strategies that help MSPs leverage our platform to expand their customer bases and service offerings and become more efficient business operators. Our partner success teams are categorized into onboarding, post-sales engineering, and partner success management. These cross-functional teams collectively educate our MSP partners on how to properly configure and use our platform and solutions for their individualized use cases and how to build successful businesses on our platform.
Through our Customer Success Center, our MSP partners have access to a range of educational resources such as the MSP Institute, Head Nerds, and community-based knowledge. Our MSP Institute provides training, tips, and playbooks across business, sales, marketing, and technical tracks from experts and industry leaders. Our Head Nerds program, launched in February 2020, delivers training, resources, and consultative sessions to help MSPs understand and optimize their businesses for the most important growth areas including security, backup, automation, and operations.
We utilize our deep partner community as a valuable source of information exchange. Through moderated forums, peer councils, expert series and industry expert blogs, our MSP partners learn best practices about how to create and sell services, protect their customers and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving managed services space.
Support
Our experienced and localized support teams provide our MSP partners with 24x7x365 technical support for our platform and solutions.
Research and development
Our research and development organization is primarily responsible for the architecture, design, development, testing and deployment of new solutions and improvements to existing solutions, with a focus on ensuring that our platform is fully integrated and extensible.
We have designed our software development process to be responsive to the needs of our MSP partners, cost efficient and agile. We work closely with our MSP partners throughout the development process to build solutions that address the problems our MSP partners and their customers face. We regularly have a subset of our partners participate in processes to validate that our solutions and features are what they are looking for to improve their operations and address their most pressing demands.
We have built a development organization that allows us to add new features and enhance our platform quickly and efficiently. Our global development model allows us to source from a large talent pool by participating in multiple labor markets. We utilize small scrum teams that follow standard practices to build and test their code and foster continuous improvement. We share our development values across our offices and aim to assign meaningful design and development work to our international locations.
Competition
We compete in a large and fragmented industry with several vendors that provide technologies used by MSPs and other IT service providers to service SMEs. We compete with vendors in the following categories:
•MSP pure-play: Vendors focused on the MSP market which provide broad, integrated solutions that include monitoring and management, data protection, business management tools and security offerings. Examples of such vendors are Kaseya, Datto (a Kaseya company) and ConnectWise.
•Niche or domain-specific: Small to large enterprise vendors that provide solutions focused on a particular service that may be sold by MSPs, such as network monitoring, systems management, email security, remote access and support and data protection. Examples of such vendors are Auvik, Mimecast and Veeam.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•breadth and extensibility of features and functionality; 
•focus on and alignment with both MSP and SME success;
•scalability, performance and reliability of our platform and solutions;
•ability to solve the technical and business problems of MSPs and customers of all sizes and complexities;
•flexibility of deployment models, whether public or private cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment;
•continued innovation to keep pace with evolving technology requirements and the changing needs of the SME market;
•ease of use and deployment;
•brand awareness and reputation among MSPs, their technicians and other IT professionals;
•total cost of ownership and alignment of cost with business objectives and needs of the MSP and SME markets; and
•effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.
We believe that we compete favorably on these factors.
Our People
We are a global software company. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,462 employees fully dedicated to our business, of which 321 were employed in the United States and 1,141 were employed outside of the United States. Of these employees, 1,454 were employed full time. We strive to be a people-centric company and believe we have a positive relationship with our employees, which we continue to nurture and develop. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
Our success is the result of our talented, experienced and high performing employees across our organization, including functions such as research and development, sales and marketing, partner success and general and administrative.
Our Values
Our values serve as our guiding principles to help drive our decisions and behaviors with each other and our partners. We hire based on our values, recognize each other based on our values, and strive to uphold our values in all of our interactions - every day. 
•N-rich Lives: We use our talents to find meaning and purpose in all that we do.
•N-spire Others: We unlock potential and help bring out the best in others.
•N-joy the Journey: We are passionate about what we do and have fun along the way.
Employee Engagement
We survey employees two times a year to ensure that all employees’ voices have an opportunity to be heard and we better understand the key areas where we can improve the employee experience. These key areas include N-able’s values; our employees’ impression of the executive team; employees’ experience in their individual roles, of their direct teams and with 
their direct managers; and employees’ sense of belonging at work. Survey results are reviewed by our senior leadership, reported to the whole company and used to inform action plans at all levels of the organization.
As a part of our employee engagement strategy, we focus on four pillars that we believe are core to building our culture of belonging and offering an exceptional employee experience: Diversity, Equality and Belonging (DEB), Giving, Wellness, and FuN. We want our employees to feel supported to do their best work and N-joy the Journey along the way. 
Diversity, Equality and Belonging
As a global company, we have the distinct advantage of employing talented and diverse individuals across different ethnicities, genders, races, religions, sexual orientations and generations, all supported through a focus on innovation and inclusion. Communities of Interest (COI) are a core part of our diversity, equality and belonging (DEB) strategy and are employee-driven, company supported interest groups that are open to all N-able employees globally, intended to foster inclusivity and belonging. We currently have three COIs: PRISM, supporting our LGBTQIA+ community; WONDER, supporting our employees who identify as women; and Shades, supporting our employees of color. Our culture of belonging enables us to deliver strong financial performance and build lasting relationships with our communities around the world. 
Giving: Community Involvement
We encourage and support our employees in giving back to the communities where they live and work. N-able employees receive two fully paid VoluNteer Days annually and we encourage them to use this time to support causes that are meaningful to them. During our annual Season of Giving, our employees join company coordinated group Volunteer Days to make an even bigger impact. In 2022, we had employees across the globe use their VoluNteer Days to donate over 2,300 hours to non-profits in their communities. In addition, we facilitate recommendations by and to employees of opportunities to give of time, talent or treasure via our FuN-raising platform and seek employee input on corporate giving in honor of certain holidays and observances.
Wellness
Supporting our employees’ abilities to prioritize and maintain their overall health and wellness is an important focus area to drive engagement and create an exceptional experience. We provide resources and invest in their well-being with everything from comprehensive benefits to specialized wellness programming around the world to a global Employee Assistance Program (EAP) with local language support for all employees and their family members. 
Learning and Development
We are committed to providing our employees with a holistic growth and learning journey to help them make the most of their careers. Our learning and development program includes uniquely designed group training for new hires during their onboarding process and for advancing employees, virtual live sessions on key topics, access to a robust online learning platform and suggested courses to support career growth and our commitment to DEB.
Notable Recognition
N-able’s achievements as an employer of choice earned us a number of awards during 2022. We achieved Great Place to Work certification, a globally recognized authority on company culture. Additionally, notable awards include a Silver 2022 Stevie Award for HR Executive of the Year; and N-able being recognized by Comparably among the companies with the Happiest Employees, Best Company Compensation, Best Global Culture, Best Company Work-Life Balance and Best CEO. 
We believe the combination of our relationship with our employees, the strength of our software platform and our alignment with our MSP partners and business model differentiates us in the market. Our ability to achieve our goals has always been, and continues to be, a result of the strong values and tremendous passion of our people. We continue to invest heavily in attracting top talent, training and development initiatives and motivating, engaging and retaining high potential employees.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2022, we owned five issued U.S. patents and one issued foreign patent, with expiration dates ranging from February 22, 2033 to July 12, 2034. N‑able may consider filing patent applications in the future, and we cannot guarantee that patents will be issued with respect to the current patent applications in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek or at all. Our patents and any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We endeavor to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of, and safeguard our ownership of, our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property rights, and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions against these infringers being successful, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available or where we have operations. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.
